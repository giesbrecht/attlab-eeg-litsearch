This paper presents a deep learning driven electroencephalography (EEG) -BCI system to perform decoding of hand motor imagery using deep convolution neural network architecture, with spectrally localized time-domain representation of multi-channel EEG as input. A significant increase in decoding performance in terms of accuracy of +6.47% is obtained compared to a wideband EEG representation. We further illustrate the movement class specific feature patterns for both the architectures and demonstrate that higher difference between classes is observed using the proposed architecture. We conclude that the network trained by taking into account the dynamic spatial interactions in distinct frequency bands of EEG, can offer better decoding performance and aid in better interpretation of learned features.

In this paper, EEG recognition algorithm is constructed based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT), common spatial patterns (CSP) and extreme learning machine (ELM). DWT and CSP are used for joint feature extraction, which solves the problem that traditional CSP is sensitive to noise. ELM is used for classification, which improves the real-time performance of the BCI system.

This type of BCI has been widely studied and used as an alternative mode of communication and environmental control for disabled patients, such as those suffering from a brainstem stroke or a spinal cord injury (SCI). Notwithstanding the success of traditional machine learning methods in classifying EEG signals, these methods still rely on hand-crafted features. The extraction of such features is a difficult task due to the high non-stationarity of EEG signals, which is a major cause by the stagnating progress in classification performance. Remarkable advances in deep learning methods allow end-to-end learning without any feature engineering, which could benefit BCI motor imagery applications. We developed three deep learning models: (1) A long short-term memory (LSTM); (2) a spectrogram-based convolutional neural network model (CNN); and (3) a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN), for decoding motor imagery movements directly from raw EEG signals without (any manual) feature engineering. Results were evaluated on our own publicly available, EEG data collected from 20 subjects and on an existing dataset known as 2b EEG dataset from "BCI Competition IV". Overall, better classification performance was achieved with deep learning models compared to state-of-the art machine learning techniques, which could chart a route ahead for developing new robust techniques for EEG signal decoding. We underpin this point by demonstrating the successful real-time control of a robotic arm using our CNN based BCI.

Because of the low-cost, noninvasive nature of EEG, it may be useful for classification of motor movements when a patient controls a prosthetic device. However, due to the high velocity nature of EEG recordings, the data used in such a classification are often large and may take a long time to process on a local, non-distributed computer. Here we explore the use of a distributed computing architecture for storage and processing of EEG data. We evaluate the classification of EEG recordings during hand movements. We find that processing these data on a distributed system results in much faster classification times (e.g., 726 seconds versus 3925 seconds) without limiting accuracy (e.g., AUC of 0.85).

In Demand-Selection Tasks (DST), participants tend to choose the easy option over the hard one. The neural underpinnings of this effect, however, are not well understood. The current study is an initial approximation to adapt a DST to a format that allows measuring concurrent high-density electroencephalography. We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode conflict-related neural processes associated with congruent or incongruent events in a time-frequency resolved way and determined how different frequency bands contribute to the overall decoding accuracy. The decoding analysis involved the use of Support Vector Machines, a supervised learning algorithm that provides a theoretically elegant, computationally efficient, and very effective solution for many practical pattern recognition problems. Preliminary results show significant differences in activation patterns for congruent and incongruent trials, yielding 80% of decoding accuracy 400 ms after the stimulus onset. The results of frequency bands contribution analysis suggest that context-dependent proportion of congruency effect may rely on neural processes operating in Delta and Theta-band frequencies.

The brain dynamics of MI is usually measured by electroencephalography (EEG) due to its noninvasiveness. The next generation of brain-computer interface systems can benefit from the generative deep learning (GDL) models by providing end-to-end (e2e) machine learning and increasing their accuracy. In this study, to exploit the e2e-property of deep learning models, a novel GDL methodology is proposed where only minimal objective-free preprocessing steps are needed. Furthermore, to deal with the complicated multi-class MI-EEG signals, an innovative multilevel GDL-based classifying scheme is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed model and its robustness against noisy MI-EEG signals is evaluated using two different GDL models, that is, deep belief network and stacked sparse autoencoder in e2e manner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with improved accuracy compared with the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns algorithm.

But it is still unclear whether more subtle states, e.g., covert selective attention can be decoded with EEG signals. Here we used a behavioral paradigm to introduce the shift of selective attention between the visual and auditory domain. With EEG signals, we extracted features based on Grange Causality (GC) and successfully decoded the attentional shift through a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. The decoding accuracy was significantly above the chance level for all 8 subjects tested. The features based on GC were further analyzed with tree-based feature importance analysis and recursive feature elimination (RFE) method to search for the optimal features for classification. Our work demonstrate that specific patterns of brain activities reflected by GC can be used to decode subtle state changes of the brain related to cross-modal selective attention, which opens new possibility of using passive BCIs in sophisticated perceptual and cognitive tasks.

In this study, we propose a robust and simple automated multivariate empirical wavelet transform (MEWT) algorithm for the decoding of different MI tasks. The main contributions of this study are four-fold. First, the multiscale principal component analysis method is utilized in the preprocessing module to obtain robustness against noise. Second, a novel automated channel selection strategy is proposed and then is further verified with comprehensive comparisons among three different strategies for decoding channel combination selection. Third, a sub-band alignment method by utilizing MEWT is adopted to obtain joint instantaneous amplitude and frequency components for the first time in MI applications. Four, a robust correlation-based feature selection strategy is applied to largely reduce the system complexity and computational load. Extensive experiments for subject-specific and subject independent cases are conducted with the three-benchmark datasets from BCI competition III to evaluate the performances of the proposed method by employing typical machine-learning classifiers. For subject-specific case, experimental results show that an average sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy of 98% was achieved by employing multilayer perceptron neural networks, logistic model tree and least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers, respectively for three datasets, resulting in an improvement of upto 23.50% in classification accuracy as compared with other existing method. While an average sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy of 93%, 92.1% and 91.4% was achieved for subject independent case by employing LS-SVM classifier for all datasets with an increase of up to 18.14% relative to other existing methods. Results also show that our proposed algorithm provides a classification accuracy of 100% for subjects with small training size in subject-specific case, and for subject independent case by employing a single source subject. Such satisfactory results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed MEWT algorithm for practical MI EEG signals classification.

With the emerging of Human-AI Collaboration, Human-Computer Interaction, and the development of advanced machine learning models, brain decoding based on deep learning attracts more attention. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a widely used neurophysiology tool. Inspired by the success of deep learning on image representation and neural decoding, we proposed a visual-guided EEG decoding method that contains a decoding stage and a generation stage. In the classification stage, we designed a visual-guided convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain more discriminative representations from EEG, which are applied to achieve the classification results. In the generation stage, the visual-guided EEG features are input to our improved deep generative model with a visual consistence module to generate corresponding visual stimuli. With the help of our visual-guided strategies, the proposed method outperforms traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models in the EEG decoding task.

The Decision Decoding ToolBOX (DDTBOX) - A Multivariate Pattern Analysis Toolbox for Event-Related Potentials	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						Multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA); Decoding; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Electroencephalography (EEG); Toolbox; Support vector machines	NEURAL MECHANISMS; INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; DYNAMICS; FMRI; TIME; REPRESENTATIONS; TUTORIAL; INTEGRATION; RECOGNITION	In recent years, neuroimaging research in cognitive neuroscience has increasingly used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to investigate higher cognitive functions. Here we present DDTBOX, an open-source MVPA toolbox for electroencephalography (EEG) data. DDTBOX runs under MATLAB and is well integrated with the EEGLAB/ERPLAB and Fieldtrip toolboxes (Delorme and Makeig 2004; Lopez-Calderon and Luck 2014; Oostenveld et al. 2011). It trains support vector machines (SVMs) on patterns of event-related potential (ERP) amplitude data, following or preceding an event of interest, for classification or regression of experimental variables. These amplitude patterns can be extracted across space/electrodes (spatial decoding), time (temporal decoding), or both (spatiotemporal decoding). DDTBOX can also extract SVM feature weights, generate empirical chance distributions based on shuffled-labels decoding for group-level statistical testing, provide estimates of the prevalence of decodable information in the population, and perform a variety of corrections for multiple comparisons. It also includes plotting functions for single subject and group results. DDTBOX complements conventional analyses of ERP components, as subtle multivariate patterns can be detected that would be overlooked in standard analyses. It further allows for a more explorative search for information when no ERP component is known to be specifically linked to a cognitive process of interest. In summary, DDTBOX is an easy-to-use and open-source toolbox that allows for characterising the time-course of information related to various perceptual and cognitive processes. It can be applied to data from a large number of experimental paradigms and could therefore be a valuable tool for the neuroimaging community.

One of the most often used signals is electroencephalography (EEG). Different classification methods have been applied to the analysis of EEG waves with success, such as the support vec- tor machine. We apply deep learning classification to EEG signals for the detection of epilepsy using a convolutional neural network. Besides that this approach advantageously requires no feature extraction, another novelty of this ap- proach is that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a single channel EEG. Numerical experimentation on a standard test data set shows a 90% or higher accuracy on average.

Common Spatial Patterns Feature Extraction and Support Vector Machine Classification for Motor Imagery with the SecondBrain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING			English	Article						Second Brain; Common Spatial Patterns; Electroencephalography; Brain-computer Interface; Python; EDF	EEG	Recently, a large set of electroencephalography (EEG) data is being generated by several high-quality labs worldwide and is free to be used by all researchers in the world. On the other hand, many neuroscience researchers need these data to study different neural disorders for better diagnosis and evaluating the treatment. However, some format adaptation and pre-processing are necessary before using these available data. In this paper, we introduce the SecondBrain as a new lightweight and simplified module that can easily apply various major analysis on EEG data with common data formats. The characteristics of the SecondBrain shows that it is suitable for everyday usage with medium analyzing power. It is easy to learn and accept many data formats. The SecondBrain module has been developed with Python and has the power to windowing data, whitening transform, independent component analysis (ICA), downloading the public datasets, computing common spatial patterns (CSP) and other useful analysis. The SecondBrain, also, employs a common spatial pattern (CSP) to extract features and classifying the EEG MI-based data through support vector machine (SVM). We achieved a satisfactory result in terms of speed and performance.

Accurate classification of motor-imagery based electroencephalography (EEG) is important in developing such BCI applications. We propose an image-based approach to design a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify EEG signals. In the proposed method, EEG signals were converted into images based on the locations of scalp electrodes, such that spatial correlation between neighbouring EEG channels was taken into consideration. We tested the proposed CNN architecture with both 2D and 3D kernels. EEG data were collected from a locked-in ALS patient over 5 weeks, when the subject was instructed to perform motor-imagery of right hand movement and idle state. Cross-day decoding showed that CNN was able to achieve a 2-class (right vs. idle) classification accuracy of 68.38 +/- 7.29% and 65.94 +/- 8.52% with 2D and 3D kernels respectively, compared to 55.09 +/- 5.74% for the traditionally used filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method We also observed changes in the correlation coefficient of spectral entropy in the EEG data across weeks, and these coefficients reveal frequency bands that are important for decoding. In particular, the CNN architecture with Delta band included performed 6.96% higher than that excluding the Delta band This study shows that the image-based CNN method improves the classification performance, and the inclusion of Delta band improves classification performance for the current dataset.

Insights from EEG-based visual word decoding, feature derivation and image reconstruction	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG; multivariate analysis; reading; word processing	TIME-COURSE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; FORM AREA; RECOGNITION; ERP; PATTERNS; IMPACT	Investigations into the neural basis of reading have shed light on the cortical locus and the functional role of visual-orthographic processing. Yet, the fine-grained structure of neural representations subserving reading remains to be clarified. Here, we capitalize on the spatiotemporal structure of electroencephalography (EEG) data to examine if and how EEG patterns can serve to decode and reconstruct the internal representation of visually presented words in healthy adults. Our results show that word classification and image reconstruction were accurate well above chance, that their temporal profile exhibited an early onset, soon after 100 ms, and peaked around 170 ms. Further, reconstruction results were well explained by a combination of visual-orthographic word properties. Last, systematic individual differences were detected in orthographic representations across participants. Collectively, our results establish the feasibility of EEG-based word decoding and image reconstruction. More generally, they help to elucidate the specific features, dynamics, and neurocomputational principles underlying word recognition.	[Ling, Shouyu; Lee, Andy C.

EEG signals are subject-specific, are sensitive to disturbances, and have a low signal-to-noise ratio, which has been mitigated by the use of laboratory-grade EEG acquisition equipment under highly controlled conditions. In the present study, we investigate single-trial decoding of natural, complex stimuli based on scalp EEG acquired with a portable, 32 dry-electrode sensor system in a typical office setting. We probe generalizability by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach. We demonstrate that support vector machine (SVM) classifiers trained on a relatively small set of denoised (averaged) pseudotrials perform on par with classifiers trained on a large set of noisy single-trial samples. We propose a novel method for computing sensitivity maps of EEG-based SVM classifiers for visualization of EEG signatures exploited by the SVM classifiers. Moreover, we apply an NPAIRS resampling framework for estimation of map uncertainty, and thus show that effect sizes of sensitivity maps for classifiers trained on small samples of denoised data and large samples of noisy data are similar. Finally, we demonstrate that the average pseudotrial classifier can successfully predict the class of single trials from withheld subjects, which allows for fast classifier training, parameter optimization, and unbiased performance evaluation in machine learning approaches for brain decoding.

In this study, EEG have been compared during the presence and absence of voluntary hand movement. Components of the alpha and beta frequency bands like the sensorimotor rhythm originated from the primary motor cortex and related brain areas reflect human movement. The power of 8-13 Hz alpha and 14-30 Hz beta frequency bands were used for the classification. To classify the data, k-NN algorithms (kNN), support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), decision tree classifiers (DT), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Gaussian naive bayes (NB) machine learning algorithms have been used. The best classification accuracy was achieved using decision tree algorithms which had an accuracy average f-score of 0.88 among four participants. In conclusion, decision tree classifiers ought to make alpha/beta frequency band based feature extraction for recognition of human movement.

J	Lee, HK; Choi, YS				Lee, Hyeon Kyu; Choi, Young-Seok			Application of Continuous Wavelet Transform and Convolutional Neural Network in Decoding Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface	ENTROPY			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); motor imagery (MI); continuous wavelet transform (CWT); convolutional neural network (CNN)	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; EEG; CLASSIFICATION	The motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) using electroencephalography (EEG) has been receiving attention from neural engineering researchers and is being applied to various rehabilitation applications. However, the performance degradation caused by motor imagery EEG with very low single-to-noise ratio faces several application issues with the use of a BCI system. In this paper, we propose a novel motor imagery classification scheme based on the continuous wavelet transform and the convolutional neural network. Continuous wavelet transform with three mother wavelets is used to capture a highly informative EEG image by combining time-frequency and electrode location. A convolutional neural network is then designed to both classify motor imagery tasks and reduce computation complexity. The proposed method was validated using two public BCI datasets, BCI competition IV dataset 2b and BCI competition II dataset III. The proposed methods were found to achieve improved classification performance compared with the existing methods, thus showcasing the feasibility of motor imagery BCI.

J	Ren, WJ; Han, M				Ren, Weijie; Han, Min			Classification of EEG Signals Using Hybrid Feature Extraction and Ensemble Extreme Learning Machine	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						EEG signals; Classification; Feature extraction; Ensemble extreme learning machine	FEATURE-SELECTION; LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; EPILEPSY; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; PATTERNS; SEIZURES; ENTROPY	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals play an important role in clinical diagnosis and cognitive neuroscience. Automatic classification of EEG signals is gradually becoming the research focus, which contains two procedures: feature extraction and classification. In the phase of feature extraction, a hybrid feature extraction method is proposed and the features are derived by performing linear and nonlinear feature extraction methods, which can describe abundant properties of original EEG signals. In order to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, feature selection based on class separability is employed to select the optimal feature subset. In the phase of classification, this paper presents a novel ensemble extreme learning machine based on linear discriminant analysis. Linear discriminant analysis is used to transform training subsets that are generated by bootstrap method, through which we can increase the differences of basic classifiers and reduce generalization errors of ensemble extreme learning machine. Experiments on two different EEG datasets are conducted in this study. Class separability is investigated to verify the effectiveness of feature extraction methods. The overall classification results show that compared with other similar studies, the proposed method can significantly enhance the performance of EEG signals classification.

The brain stimulating signals are detected by the BCI (Brain-computer Interface) which based on the idea of emotional brain computer. BCI work can be in three steps first, collecting brain signal second step, interpreting the brain signal and third step, output command to connected machine according to the brain signal. the brain wave signals have specific unique electrical signals identified with a different individual and they are hard to imitate also. Electroencephalogram (EEG) catches the brain waves as electrical signals and utilized as a part of different applications including therapeutic services and human PC collaboration. In this proposed paper, we discuss local signal pattern transformation based feature extraction technique method for brain signal (EEG). In this paper, two functional feature extraction technique method namely One Dimensional Local Gradient Pattern (1D-LGP) and Local Neighboring Descriptive Pattern (LNDP) has been discussed for brain signal EEG for machine learning. The EEG raw dataset is provided by and is provided by Neurodynamics Laboratory, State University of New York Health Center Brooklyn, New York. The classification performance is evaluated is 10 fold classification technique in machine learning. 1D-LGP and LNDP both feature extraction technique with machine learning classifier achieved 88.90% and 90.93%, classification to EEG brain signal respectively. This study suggests LNDP could be an effective feature extraction technique for classification for EEG signal.

In this paper, we designed a paradigm of sequential finger movements and utilized spatial filters for feature extraction to classify single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) induced by finger movements of left and right hand. Ten healthy subjects participated the experiment. The analysis of EEG patterns showed significant contralateral dominance. We investigated how data length affected the classification accuracy. The classification accuracy was improved with the increase of the keystrokes in one trial, and the results were 87.42%, 91.21%, 93.08% and 93.59% corresponding to single keystroke, two keystrokes, three keystrokes and four keystrokes. This study would be helpful to improve the decoding efficiency and optimize the encoding method of motor-related EEG information.

Translating brain activities measured by electroencephalography (EEG) into correct control commands is a critical problem in this field. Most existing EEG decoding methods separate feature extraction from classification and thus are not robust across different BCI users. In this paper, we propose to learn subject-specific features jointly with the classification rule. We develop a deep convolutional network (ConvNet) to decode EEG signals end-to-end by stacking time-frequency transformation, spatial filtering, and classification together. Our proposed ConvNet implements a joint space-time-frequency feature extraction scheme for EEG decoding. Morlet waveletl-ike kernels used in our network significantly reduce the number of parameters compared with classical convolutional kernels and endow the features learned at the corresponding layer with a clear interpretation, i.e. spectral amplitude. We further utilize subject-to-subject weight transfer, which uses parameters of the networks trained for existing subjects to initialize the network for a new subject, to solve the dilemma between a large number of demanded data for training deep ConvNets and small labeled data collected in BCIs. The proposed approach is evaluated on three public data sets, obtaining superior classification performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Up to now, various findings of activated patterns associated with different emotions have been reported. However, their stability over time has not been fully investigated yet. In this paper, we focus on identifying EEG stability in emotion recognition. We systematically evaluate the performance of various popular feature extraction, feature selection, feature smoothing and pattern classification methods with the DEAP dataset and a newly developed dataset called SEED for this study. Discriminative Graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine with differential entropy features achieves the best average accuracies of 69.67 and 91.07 percent on the DEAP and SEED datasets, respectively. The experimental results indicate that stable patterns exhibit consistency across sessions; the lateral temporal areas activate more for positive emotions than negative emotions in beta and gamma bands; the neural patterns of neutral emotions have higher alpha responses at parietal and occipital sites; and for negative emotions, the neural patterns have significant higher delta responses at parietal and occipital sites and higher gamma responses at prefrontal sites. The performance of our emotion recognition models shows that the neural patterns are relatively stable within and between sessions.

Functional network analysis and seed analysis were used for comparing AD pattern versus control pattern. Machine learning methods were employed for proving the effectiveness of our method. Results: Patients with AD exhibited hypoconnectivity over the whole scalp, especially for long-range connections. Significant decreased connections between frontal and other regions reveals that the transmission of signals related to frontal hub is indeed damaged due to AD. The predictors consist of interfrontal and left frontal-right occipital connections that led to a good performance for distinguishing AD patients and normal subjects with over 96% classification accuracy and 0.98 parametric area under curve. Conclusion: Above findings demonstrated the superior power of the EEG markers quantified by our GCMSEV network, as the indicator of abnormal functional connectivity in the brain of AD patients. Significance: This paper develops a novel EEG-based strategy for functional connectivity quantification and enriches the topographical biomarkers used for neurophysiological assessment.

In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework to realize the training free motor imagery (MI) BCI systems. Specifically, we employ the common space pattern (CSP) extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) as the handcrafted feature. Instead of log-energy, we use the multi-channel series in CSP space to retain the temporal information. Then we propose a separated channel convolutional network, here termed SCCN, to encode the multi-channel data. Finally, the encoded features are concatenated and fed into a recognition network to perform the final MI task recognition. We compared the results of the deep model with classical machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistics regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, the quantitative analysis was evaluated on our dataset and the BCI competition IV-2b dataset. The results have shown that our proposed model can improve the accuracy of EEG based MI classification (2-13% improvement for our dataset and 2-15% improvement for BCI competition IV-2b dataset) in comparison with traditional methods under the training free condition.

Absolute pitch (AP) musicians perceive, recognize, and name pitches in absolute terms, whereas relative pitch (RP) musicians, representing the large majority of musicians, perceive pitches in relation to other pitches. In this study, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the neural representations underlying tone listening and tone labeling in a large sample of musicians (n =105). Participants performed a pitch processing task with a listening and a labeling condition during EEG acquisition. Using a brain-decoding framework, we tested a prediction derived from both theoretical and empirical accounts of AP, namely that the representational similarity of listening and labeling is higher in AP musicians than in RP musicians. Consistent with the prediction, time-resolved single-trial EEG decoding revealed a higher representational similarity in AP musicians during late stages of pitch perception. Time-frequency-resolved EEG decoding further showed that the higher representational similarity was present in oscillations in the theta and beta frequency bands. Supplemental univariate analyses were less sensitive in detecting subtle group differences in the frequency domain. Taken together, the results suggest differences between AP and RP musicians in late pitch processing stages associated with cognition, rather than in early processing stages associated with perception.

Recently, electroencephalography- (EEG-) based physiological and brain activities for fatigue detection have been increasingly investigated. However, how to find an effective method or model to timely and efficiently detect the mental states of drivers still remains a challenge. In this paper, we combine common spatial pattern (CSP) and propose a light-weighted classifier, LightFD, which is based on gradient boosting framework for EEG mental states identification. The comparable results with traditional classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), show that the proposed model could achieve better classification performance, as well as the decision efficiency. Furthermore, we also test and validate that LightFD has better transfer learning performance in EEG classification of driver mental states. In summary, our proposed LightFD classifier has better performance in real-time EEG mental state prediction, and it is expected to have broad application prospects in practical brain-computer interaction (BCI).

Using this novel pre-processing step prior to entering a random forests classifier, our method substantially outperforms all previous results with a balanced accuracy of 97.4 percent. Our machine learning work contributes to healthcare and information systems. Due to its drastic and protracted consequences, alcohol consumption is always a critical issue in our society. Consequences of alcoholism in the brain can be recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). Our work can be used to automatically detect alcoholism in EEG mass data within milliseconds. In addition, our results challenge the medically outdated EEG standard bandwidths.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing typically requires complex protocols for feature extraction. Machine learning emerged as a potential tool to demystify these complications. Brain-computer interface (BCI) researchers have already implemented machine learning techniques to solve complicated paradigms. These studies achieved significant results and suggested that machine learning could accelerate complex data analysis. This study aims to develop quantitative bibliometric research, i.e., a roadmap, to evaluate the development of studies involving machine learning and BCI applications, especially motor imagery protocols. The results showed that machine learning provides innovative solutions for motor imagery studies. Although, there were few publications related to machine learning and BCI, it is clear that the scientific applications are growing fast, and are developing higher-performance EEG-based approaches.

Amongst these, one of the most important signals is electroencephalography (EEG) signal that is used to monitor the brain activities. Brain-computer-interface (BCI) has also become a hot topic of research where EEG signals are usually acquired using non-invasive sensors. In this work, we propose a scheme based on common spatial spectral pattern (CSSP) and optimization of temporal filters for improved motor imagery (MI) EEG signal recognition. CSSP is proposed as it improves the spatial resolution while the temporal filter is optimized for each subject as the frequency band which contains most significant information varies amongst different subjects. The proposed scheme is evaluated using two publicly available datasets: BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition IV dataset 1. The proposed scheme obtained promising results and outperformed other state-of-the-art methods. The findings of this work will be beneficial for developing improved BCI systems.

Efficient Biosignal Processing Using Hyperdimensional Computing: Network Templates for Combined Learning and Classification of ExG Signals	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Biosignal classification; brain-inspired comput- ing; brain-machine interface; ECoG; EEG; EMG; error-related potential; hyperdimensional (HD) computing; human-machine interface; interpretable machine learning; motor imagery; network architectures; one-shot learning; seizure detection; vector symbolic architectures	REPRESENTATION; PREDICTION	Recognizing the very size of the brain's circuits, hyperdimensional (HD) computing can model neural activity patterns with points in a HD space, that is, with HD vectors. Key examined properties of HD computing include: a versatile set of arithmetic operations on HD vectors, generality, scalability, analyzability, one-shot learning, and energy efficiency. These make it a prime candidate for efficient biosignal processing where signals are noisy and nonstationary, training data sets are not huge, individual variability is significant, and energy-efficiency constraints are tight. Purely based on native HD computing operators, we describe a combined method for multiclass learning and classification of various ExG biosignals such as electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocorticography (ECoG). We develop a full set of HD network templates that comprehensively encode body potentials and brain neural activity recorded from different electrodes into a single HD vector without requiring domain expert knowledge or ad hoc electrode selection process. Such encoded HD vector is processed as a single unit for fast one-shot learning, and robust classification. It can be interpreted to identify the most useful features as well. Compared to state-of-the-art counterparts, HD computing enables online, incremental, and fast learning as it demands less than a third as much training data as well as less preprocessing.

Among various MW indicators, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are particularly attractive because of their high temporal resolution and sensitivity to the occupation of working memory. However, the individual difference of the EEG feature distribution may impair the machine-learning based MW classifier. In this paper, we employed a fast-training neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), as the basis to build an individual-specific classifier ensemble to recognize binary MW. To improve the diversity of the classification committee, heterogeneous member classifiers were adopted by fusing multiple ELMs and Bayesian models. Specifically, a deep network structure was applied in each weak model aiming at finding informative EEG feature representations. The structure of hyper-parameters of the proposed heterogeneous ensemble ELM (HE-ELM) was then identified and then its performance was compared against several competitive MW classifiers. We found that the HE-ELM model was superior for improving the individual-specific accuracy of MW assessments.

Motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG), a promising technology to provide assistance and support rehabilitation of neurological patients with sensorimotor impairments, require a reliable and adaptable subject-specific model to efficiently decode motor intention. The most popular EEG feature extraction algorithm for MI-BCIs is the common spatial patterns (CSP) method, but its performance strongly depends on the predefined frequency band and time segment length for analyzing the EEG signal. Approach. In this work, a novel method for efficiently decoding motor intention for EEG-based BCIs performing multiple frequency band analysis in multiple EEG segments is presented. This decoding algorithm uses raw multichannel EEG data which are decomposed into specific T temporal and F frequency bands. Features are extracted at each t-f band by using CSP. Feature selection and classification are simultaneously performed by means of a fast procedure, based on elastic-net regression, which allows for the inclusion of a priori discriminative information into the model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested off-line on two public EEG-based MI-BCI datasets and on a self-acquired dataset in two configurations: multiple temporal windows and single temporal window. Main results. The experimental results show that the proposed multiple time-frequency band method yields overall accuracy improvements of up to 9% (average accuracy of 84.8%) as compared to the best current state-of-the-art methods based on filter bank analysis and CSP for MI detection. Also, classification variability is reduced, making the proposed method more robust to infra-subject EEG fluctuations. Significance. This paper presents a novel approach for improving motor intention detection by automatically selecting subject-specific spatio-temporal-spectral features, especially when MI has to be detected against rest condition. This technique contributes to the further advancement and application of EEG-based MI-BCIs for assistance and neurorehabilitation therapy.

Shamim			Deep Learning for EEG motor imagery classification based on multi-layer CNNs feature fusion	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						EEG motor imagery classification; Deep learning; Convolution neural network; Multi-layer CNNs feature fusion	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS	Electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery (MI) signals have recently gained a lot of attention as these signals encode a person's intent of performing an action. Researchers have used MI signals to help disabled persons, control devices such as wheelchairs and even for autonomous driving. Hence decoding these signals accurately is important for a Brain-Computer interface (BCI) system. But EEG decoding is a challenging task because of its complexity, dynamic nature and low signal to noise ratio. Convolution neural network (CNN) has shown that it can extract spatial and temporal features from EEG, but in order to learn the dynamic correlations present in MI signals, we need improved CNN models. CNN can extract good features with both shallow and deep models pointing to the fact that, at different levels relevant features can be extracted. Fusion of multiple CNN models has not been experimented for EEG data. In this work, we propose a multi-layer CNNs method for fusing CNNs with different characteristics and architectures to improve EEG MI classification accuracy. Our method utilizes different convolutional features to capture spatial and temporal features from raw EEG data. We demonstrate that our novel MCNN and CCNN fusion methods outperforms all the state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques for EEG classification. We have performed various experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN fusion method on public datasets. The proposed MCNN method achieves 75.7% and 95.4% on the BO Competition IV-2a dataset and the High Gamma Dataset respectively. The proposed CCNN method based on autoencoder cross-encoding achieves more than 10% improvement for cross-subject EEG classification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The renaissance of BCI opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI approaches. Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems. Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most appropriate BCI application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI paradigms regarding their advantages and disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For each paradigm, various EEG decoding algorithms and classification methods are evaluated. The applications of these paradigms with targeted patients are summarized. Finally, potential problems with EEG-based BCI systems are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed.

The trial-based classification based on a single subject data revealed temporo-spatial neural representations that most accurately predict speaker stance at early and late time windows that roughly corresponded with the ERP (event-related potentials) elicited by each stance in our earlier study (Jiang & Pell, 2015). These findings highlight the significance of applying multivariate pattern recognition to the multimodal data (such as neural responses) to predict dynamic categorical representations relevant to social interaction.

In this study, we propose, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a novel data adaptive empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based signal decomposition method for improving the classification accuracy of MI based EEG signals. Specifically, to reduce the system complexity and execution time, the proposed method selects 18 electrodes out of 118 to analyze the non-stationary and nonlinear EEG signal behaviors. Meanwhile, the method adopts the Welch power spectral density (PSD) analysis method for single mode selection out of the total 10 for each channel, and the Hilbert transform (HT) method for both instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous frequency (IF) signal components extraction for each selected mode. With seven commonly used machine-learning classifiers adopted, extensive experiments were conducted with the benchmark dataset IVa from BCI competition III to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that with the IA and IF component features being tested using the least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier, the EWT method achieves an average classification accuracy of 95.2% and 94.6% respectively, which is higher as compared with the existing methods. While for every participant, a classification accuracy of at least 80% could be achieved by employing a single feature only. Results also show that a combination of EWT and higher order statistics features, which contain both kurtosis and skewness of the extracted instantaneous components, help achieve a higher success rate. The better performances of EWT over those of the existing methods demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of EWT for BCI system applications.

J	Lee, M; Ryu, J; Kim, DH				Lee, Miran; Ryu, Jaehwan; Kim, Deok-Hwan			Automated epileptic seizure waveform detection method based on the feature of the mean slope of wavelet coefficient counts using a hidden Markov model and EEG signals	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article						discrete wavelet transform; electroencephalography; feature extraction; machine learning; Seizure detection	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BINARY PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; REPRESENTATION; PREDICTION; TRANSFORM	Long-term electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring is time-consuming, and requires experts to interpret EEG signals to detect seizures in patients. In this paper, we propose a novel automated method called adaptive slope of wavelet coefficient counts over various thresholds (ASCOT) to classify patient episodes as seizure waveforms. ASCOT involves extracting the feature matrix by calculating the mean slope of wavelet coefficient counts over various thresholds in each frequency subband. We validated our method using our own database and a public database to avoid overtuning. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieved a reliable and promising accuracy in both our own database (98.93%) and the public database (99.78%). Finally, we evaluated the performance of the method considering various window sizes. In conclusion, the proposed method achieved a reliable seizure detection performance with a short-term window size. Therefore, our method can be utilized to interpret long-term EEG results and detect momentary seizure waveforms in diagnostic systems.

One of the most important issues of current research is how to detect automatically whether the user intends to send some message to a certain device. This study presents a proposal, based on a hierarchical structured system, for recognising intentional and non-intentional mental tasks on a BCI system by applying machine learning techniques to the EEG signals. First-level clustering is performed to distinguish between intentional control (IC) and non-intentional control (NC) state patterns. Then, the patterns recognised as IC are passed on to a second stage where supervised learning techniques are used to classify them. In BCI applications, it is critical to correctly classify NC states with a low false positive rate (FPR) to avoid undesirable effects. According to the literature, we selected a maximum FPR of 10%. Under these conditions, our proposal achieved an average test accuracy of 66.6%, with an 8.2% FPR, for the BCI competition IIIa dataset. The main contribution of this paper is the hierarchical approach, based on machine learning paradigms, which performs intentional and non-intentional discrimination and, depending on the case, classifies the intended command selected by the user.

A rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system relies on single-trial classification of event-related potentials (ERP) to categorize target and non-target images. The system works well in well-controlled laboratory settings; however, transitioning this approach into more dynamic, unconstrained environments poses several significant challenges. One major challenge is how to address the problem of session-to-session variability in EEG decoding. For a new session, a time-consuming and laborious calibration procedure is usually required to collect sufficient individual data for training a new classifier. This paper employed a subspace decomposition algorithm, Signal-to-noise ratio Maximizer for event-related potentials (SIM), to improve the session-to-session transfer performance of the RSVP-based BCI system. EEG data were collected from 17 subjects, each of whom performed two task sessions on two different days. Compared with the standard hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA) algorithm, the classification performance was significantly improved by combining the SIM algorithm with the HDCA algorithm. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) across all subjects was improved from 0.7242 to 0.8546. The results suggest that the proposed approach efficiently obviates the session-to-session variability in task-related ERP signals and thereby facilitates system calibration of the RSVP-based BCIs.

In clinical practice, different acupuncture manipulations are required to achieve different therapeutic effects, which means it is crucial to distinguish different acupuncture manipulations. In this paper, we proposed a classification framework for different acupuncture manipulations, which employed the graph theory and machine learning method. Multichannel EEG signals evoked by acupuncture at "Zusanli" acupoint were recorded from healthy humans by two acupuncture manipulations: twirling-rotating (TR) and lifting-thrusting (LT). Phase locking value was used to estimate the phase synchronization of pair-wise EEG channels. It was found that acupunctured by TR manipulation exhibit significantly higher synchronization degree than acupunctured by LT manipulation. With the construction of functional brain network, the topological features of graph theory were extracted. Taken the network features as inputs, machine learning classifiers were established to classify acupuncture manipulations. The highest accuracy can achieve 92.14% with support vector machine. By further optimizing the network features utilized in machine learning classifiers, it was found that the combination of node betweenness and small world network index is the most effective factor for acupuncture manipulations classification. These findings suggested that our approach provides new ideas for automatically identify acupuncture manipulations from the perspective of functional brain networks and machine learning methods.

Recently, deep learning algorithms using decomposed spectrums of EEG as inputs may omit important spatial dependencies and different temporal scale information, thus generated the poor decoding performance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end EEG decoding framework, which employs raw multi-channel EEG as inputs, to boost decoding accuracy by the channel-projection mixed-scale convolutional neural network (CP-MixedNet) aided by amplitude-perturbation data augmentation. Specifically, the first block in CP-MixedNet is designed to learn primary spatial and temporal representations from EEG signals. The mixed-scale convolutional block is then used to capture mixed-scale temporal information, which effectively reduces the number of training parameters when expanding reception fields of the network. Finally, based on the features extracted in previous blocks, the classification block is constructed to classify EEG tasks. The experiments are implemented on two public EEG datasets (BCI competition IV 2a and High gamma dataset) to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The competitive results demonstrate that our proposed method is a promising solution to improve the decoding performance of motor imagery BCIs.

EEG-based BCI system for decoding finger movements within the same hand	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Brain computer interfaces (BCIs); Time-frequency distribution; Finger movements; Support vector machines	MOTOR IMAGERY; BRAIN	Decoding the movements of different fingers within the same hand can increase the control's dimensions of the electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. This in turn enables the subjects who are using assistive devices to better perform various dexterous tasks. However, decoding the movements performed by different fingers within the same hand by analyzing the EEG signals is considered a challenging task. In this paper, we present a new EEG-based BCI system for decoding the movements of each finger within the same hand based on analyzing the EEG signals using a quadratic time-frequency distribution (QTFD), namely the Choi-William distribution (CWD). In particular, the CWD is employed to characterize the time-varying spectral components of the EEG signals and extract features that can capture movement-related information encapsulated within the EEG signals. The extracted CWD-based features are used to build a two-layer classification framework that decodes finger movements within the same hand. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated by recording the EEG signals for eighteen healthy subjects while performing twelve finger movements using their right hands. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system to decode finger movements within the same hand of each subject.

For example, visual attention is a complex phenomenon of searching for a target while filtering out competing stimuli. In the present study, we developed a new Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) platform to decode brainwave patterns during sustained attention in a participant. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals using a wireless headset were collected in real time during a visual attention task. In our experimental protocol, we primed participants to discriminate a sequence of composite images. Each image was a fair superimposition of a scene and a face image. The participants were asked to respond to the intended subcategory (e.g., indoor scenes) while withholding their responses for the irrelevant subcategories (e.g., outdoor scenes). We developed an individualized model using machine learning techniques to decode attentional state of the participant based on their brainwaves. Our model revealed the instantaneous attention towards face and scene categories. We conducted the experiment with six volunteer participants. The average decoding accuracy of our model was about 77%, which was comparable with a former study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present work was an attempt to reveal momentary level of sustained attention using EEG signals. The platform may have potential applications in visual attention evaluation and closed-loop brainwave regulation in future.

The analyzing EEG data are divided into training and test sets. The training set is used to select appropriate spatial filters with dominant features. To accomplish such features, the EEG of training set is segmented again into two subsets termed as training subset and test subset. The features of both subsets are extracted using common spatial pattern. Then features of training subset are ranked using mutual information based approach. Besides, the features of test subset are also ranked according to the order of the training subset features. The initial classification performance using training and test subsets are obtained by using linear discriminant analysis. Then a grid search method is employed to select the effective number of spatial filter pairs as well as the discriminative features. Thus obtained spatial filter and features are used in actual classification accuracy of the test set of EEG. The experimental results show that the proposed approach yields comparatively superior classification performance compared to prevailing methods.

Quantitative Electroencephalography in Guiding Treatment of Major Depression	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						electroencephalography; quantitative EEG; biomarkers; depression; machine learning; PEER	RESPONDERS; EEG; NONRESPONDERS; ASYMMETRY	This paper reviews significant contributions to the evidence for the use of quantitative electroencephalography features as biomarkers of depression treatment and examines the potential of such technology to guide pharmacotherapy. Frequency band abnormalities such as alpha and theta band abnormalities have shown promise as have combinatorial measures such as cordance (a measure combining alpha and theta power) and the Antidepressant Treatment Response Index in predicting medication treatment response. Nevertheless, studies have been hampered by methodological problems and inconsistencies, and these approaches have ultimately failed to elicit any significant interest in actual clinical practice. More recent machine learning approaches such as the Psychiatric Encephalography Evaluation Registry (PEER) technology and other efforts analyze large datasets to develop variables that may best predict response rather than test a priori hypotheses. PEER is a technology that may go beyond predicting response to a particular antidepressant and help to guide pharmacotherapy.

Although data-driven machine learning (ML) approach has shown promise in MWL recognition, it is usually difficult to acquire sufficient labeled data to train the ML model. This paper proposes semi-supervised extreme learning machines (SS-ELM) for MWL pattern classification using solely a small number of labeled data. The experimental data analysis results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ELM paradigm for the 3-class MWL classification.

The EEG signals elicited by different stimuli, such as calling by name and music, were collected from 20 patients, including 10 in a minimally conscious and 10 in a vegetative state. A classification-based assessment framework was employed, consisting of the following major components: a preprocessing step, applied to remove the noises in the EEG data; selection of two types of features, including common spatial patterns and partial least squares; and application of the multiple kernel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to perform the training and classification. Our results indicate that the EEG features detected in severe disorders of consciousness are significant for different auditory stimuli, and the multiple kernel SVM yields the best classification performance among different classifiers. We achieved average classification accuracies of 81.24% and 94.60% for calling by name and musical stimuli, respectively. The proposed method uses EEG signals to effectively classify patients into minimally conscious and vegetative states. It could be a promising tool for quantitatively identifying states of severe disorder of consciousness, and could also provide auxiliary information for clinical assessment of the level of consciousness.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used to depict electrical activities of the brain. In the proposed study, a new computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been developed to recognize alcoholic and normal EEG patterns, accurately. In this paper, we present an automatic system for the classification of normal and alcoholic EEG signals using orthogonal wavelet filter bank (OWFB). First, we derive sub-bands (SBs) of EEG signals. Then, we compute logarithms of the energies (LEs) of the SBs. The LEs are employed as the discriminating features for the separation of alcoholic and normal EEG signals. A supervised machine learning algorithm called K nearest neighbor (KNN) has been employed to classify normal and alcoholic patterns. The proposed model has yielded very good classification results. We have achieved a classification accuracy (CA) of 94.20% with tenfold cross-validation (CV).

Diagnosing depression in the early stage is crucial to treatment process. However, due to depression's comorbid nature and the subjectivity in diagnosis, an early diagnosis could be challenging. Recently, machine learning approaches have been used to process Electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging data to facilitate the diagnosis. In the present study, we used a multimodal machine learning approach involving EEG, eye tracking and galvanic skin response data as input to classify depression patients and healthy controls. Methods: One hundred and forty-four MDD depression patients and 204 matched healthy controls were recruited. They were required to watch a series of affective and neutral stimuli while EEG, eye tracking information and galvanic skin response were recorded via a set of low-cost, portable devices. Three machine learning algorithms including Random Forests, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained to build dichotomous classification model. Results: The results showed that the highest classification f1 score was obtained by Logistic Regression algorithms, with accuracy = 79.63%, precision = 76.67%, recall= 85.19% and f1 score= 80.70% Limitations: No hospitalized patients were available; only outpatients were included in the present study. The sample consisted mostly of young adult, and no elder patients were included. Conclusions: The machine learning approach can be a useful tool for classifying MDD patients and healthy controls and may help for diagnostic processes.

However, neural decoding of gait in developing children has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we collected physiological data (electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG)), and kinematic data from children performing different locomotion tasks. We also developed a state space estimation model to decode lower limb joint angles from scalp EEG. Fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials of EEG in the delta band (0.1 - 3 Hz) were used for prediction. The decoding accuracies (Pearson's r values) were promising (Hip: 0.71; Knee: 0.59; Ankle: 0 51). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of neural decoding of children walking and have implications for the development of a real-time closed-loop BMI system for the control of a pediatric exoskeleton.

The most important factor for mapping these electrical activities to develop robust Brain-Computer Interfaces is the methods used for processing these electrical signals. The electrical activities in the brain can be captured using multiple electrophysical measures such as Electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG captures neurocognitive processes, the cognitive dynamics in the time frame in which cognition occurs, and multidimensional space of brain processing.

Music Improvisation Is Characterized by Increase EEG Spectral Power in Prefrontal and Perceptual Motor Cortical Sources and Can be Reliably Classified From Non-improvisatory Performance	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						music; improvisation; machine learning; loreta; ICA; EEG; guitar; medial frontal cortex	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CREATIVE BRAIN; GENERATION; PATTERNS; PREMOTOR; MELODIES; NETWORK	This study expores neural activity underlying creative processes through the investigation of music improvisation. Fourteen guitar players with a high level of improvisation skill participated in this experiment. The experimental task involved playing 32-s alternating blocks of improvisation and scales on guitar. electroencephalography (EEG) data was measured continuously throughout the experiment. In order to remove potential artifacts and extract brain-related activity the following signal processing techniques were employed: bandpass filtering, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). For each participant, artifact related independent components (ICs) were removed from the EEG data and only ICs found to be from brain activity were retained. Source localization using this brain-related activity was carried out using sLORETA. Greater activity for improvisation over scale was found in multiple frequency bands (theta, alpha, and beta) localized primarily in the medial frontal cortex (MFC), Middle frontal gyrus (MFG), anterior cingulate, polar medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), premotor cortex (PMC), pre and postcentral gyrus (PreCG and PostCG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the temporal-parietal junction. Together this collection of brain regions suggests that improvisation was mediated by processes involved in coordinating planned sequences of movement that are modulated in response to ongoing environmental context through monitoring and feedback of sensory states in relation to internal plans and goals. Machine-learning using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) for EEG feature extraction attained a mean of over 75% classification performance for improvisation vs. scale conditions across participants. These machine-learning results are a step towards the development of a brain-computer interface that could be used for neurofeedback training to improve creativity.

This in turn can enable individuals who are suffering from transradial amputations to better control prosthetic hands and to perform various dexterous hand tasks. In particular, we present a novel three-stage framework for decoding MI tasks of the same hand. The three stages of the proposed framework are the input, feature extraction, and classification stages. At the input stage, we employ a quadratic time-frequency distribution (QTFD) to analyze the EEG signals in the joint time-frequency domain. The use of a QTFD enables to transform the EEG signals into a set of two-dimensional (2D) time-frequency images (TFIs) that describe the distribution of the energy encapsulated within the EEG signals in terms of the time, frequency, and electrode position. At the feature extraction stage, we design a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that can automatically analyze and extract salient features from the TFIs created at the input stage. Finally, the features obtained at the feature extraction stage are passed to the classification stage to assign each input TFI to one of the eleven MI tasks that are considered in the current study. The performance of our proposed framework is evaluated using EEG signals that were acquired from eighteen able-bodied subjects and four transradial amputated subjects while performing eleven MI tasks within the same hand. The average classification accuracies obtained for the able-bodied and transradial amputated subjects are 73.7% and 72.8%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed framework yields 14.5% and 11.2% improvements over the results obtained for the able-bodied and transradial amputated subjects, respectively, using conventional QTFD-based handcrafted features and a multi-class support vector machine classifier. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework to decode the MI tasks associated with the same hand for able-bodied and transradial amputated subjects.

J	Mumtaz, W; Qayyum, A				Mumtaz, Wajid; Qayyum, Abdul			A deep learning framework for automatic diagnosis of unipolar depression	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG-based deep learning for depression; EEG-based diagnosis of unipolar depression; Convolutional neural network for depression; Long short-term memory classifiers for depression; EEG-based machine learning methods for depression	NONLINEAR FEATURES; EEG	Background and purpose: In recent years, the development of machine learning (ML) frameworks for automatic diagnosis of unipolar depression has escalated to a next level of deep learning frameworks. However, this idea needs further validation. Therefore, this paper has proposed an electroencephalographic (EEG)-based deep learning framework that automatically discriminated depressed and healthy controls and provided the diagnosis. Basic procedures: In this paper, two different deep learning architectures were proposed that utilized one dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) and 1DCNN with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. The proposed deep learning architectures automatically learn patterns in the EEG data that were useful for classifying the depressed and healthy controls. In addition, the proposed models were validated with resting-state EEG data obtained from 33 depressed patients and 30 healthy controls. Main findings: As results, significant differences were observed between the two groups. The classification results involving the CNN model were accuracy=98.32%, precision=99.78%, recall=98.34%, and f-score=97.65%. In addition, the study has reported LSTM with 1DCNN classification accuracy=95.97%, precision=99.23%, recall=93.67%, and f-score=95.14%. Conclusions: Deep learning frameworks could revolutionize the clinical applications for EEG-based diagnosis for depression. Based on the results, it may be concluded that the deep learning framework could be used as an automatic method for diagnosing the depression.

However, high dimensionality on Riemannian manifold limits the application of existing techniques. In this paper, taking advantage of the locality preserving on Riemannian manifold, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction method, named local isometric embedding (LIE), to learn a low-dimensional embedding from Riemannian manifold. Further with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier performed on the embedding, we obtain a efficient decoding method for motor imagery classification. Experimental evaluation on Dataset Ha of BCI Competition IV reveals that the proposed method outperforms other competing methods.

Wearables provide enhancements for automatic tools to assist physicians during patient diagnosis, treatment, and many other situations with limited costs and computing resources. In this context, in-device processing using machine learning algorithms can accelerate syndromes monitoring such as epilepsy detection and minimize risks of privacy disclosure due to extended data transmission to cloud servers. In this paper, we investigate the performance of five machine learning algorithms, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Neural Network (NN), in terms of accuracy to diagnose a syndrome and the computational cost to embed it in a wearable device. We tested the algorithms in the classification of an Electroencephalography (EEG) sampled dataset available at the UCI machine learning repository. From the results, we concluded that SVM and RF have good accuracy in identifying epileptic seizures from the EEG dataset. Additionally, only RF fulfills the low computational cost required to embed such applications in-device.

Traditional deep learning (DL) methods usually perform better with more labeled training samples. Unfortunately, the labeled samples are usually scarce for electroencephalography (EEG) data, while unlabeled samples are available in large quantity and easy to collect. In addition, traditional DL algorithms are notoriously time-consuming for the training process. To address these issues, a novel method of hierarchical semi-supervised extreme learning machine (HSS-ELM) is proposed in this paper and applied for motor imagery (MI) task classification. Firstly, the deep architecture of hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) approach is employed for feature learning automatically, and then these new high-level features are classified using the semi-supervised ELM (SS-ELM) algorithm which can exploit the information from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments were conducted on some benchmark datasets and EEG datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, including SVM, ELM, SAE, H-ELM, and SS-ELM, our HSS-ELM method can achieve better classification accuracy, a mean kappa value of 0.7945 and 0.5701 across all subjects in the training and evaluation sessions of BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, respectively. Finally, it comes to the conclusion that the proposed method has achieved superior performance for feature extraction and classification of EEG signals.

Attempted Arm and Hand Movements can be Decoded from Low-Frequency EEG from Persons with Spinal Cord Injury	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; UPPER EXTREMITY; GRASP; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; TRAJECTORIES; STIMULATION; TETRAPLEGIA	We show that persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) retain decodable neural correlates of attempted arm and hand movements. We investigated hand open, palmar grasp, lateral grasp, pronation, and supination in 10 persons with cervical SCI. Discriminative movement information was provided by the time-domain of low-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Based on these signals, we obtained a maximum average classification accuracy of 45% (chance level was 20%) with respect to the five investigated classes. Pattern analysis indicates central motor areas as the origin of the discriminative signals. Furthermore, we introduce a proof-of-concept to classify movement attempts online in a closed loop, and tested it on a person with cervical SCI. We achieved here a modest classification performance of 68.4% with respect to palmar grasp vs hand open (chance level 50%).

J	Masood, N; Farooq, H				Masood, Naveen; Farooq, Humera			Investigating EEG Patterns for Dual-Stimuli Induced Human Fear Emotional State	SENSORS			English	Article						brain computer interface; classification; common spatial pattern (CSP); electrode reduction; electroencephalography (EEG); emotions	CHANNEL SELECTION; IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; VALENCE; AROUSAL; SIGNALS	Most electroencephalography (EEG) based emotion recognition systems make use of videos and images as stimuli. Few used sounds, and even fewer studies were found involving self-induced emotions. Furthermore, most of the studies rely on single stimuli to evoke emotions. The question of "whether different stimuli for same emotion elicitation generate any subject-independent correlations" remains unanswered. This paper introduces a dual modality based emotion elicitation paradigm to investigate if emotions can be classified induced with different stimuli. A method has been proposed based on common spatial pattern (CSP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to analyze human brain signals for fear emotions evoked with two different stimuli. Self-induced emotional imagery is one of the considered stimuli, while audio/video clips are used as the other stimuli. The method extracts features from the CSP algorithm and LDA performs classification. To investigate associated EEG correlations, a spectral analysis was performed. To further improve the performance, CSP was compared with other regularized techniques. Critical EEG channels are identified based on spatial filter weights. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first contribution for the assessment of EEG correlations in the case of self versus video induced emotions captured with a commercial grade EEG device.

Clinicians have indicated that a sensitivity of 95% with specificity below 5% was the minimum requirement for clinical acceptance. In this study, a high-performance automated EEG analysis system based on principles of machine learning and big data is proposed. This hybrid architecture integrates hidden Markov models (HMMs) for sequential decoding of EEG events with deep learning-based post-processing that incorporates temporal and spatial context. These algorithms are trained and evaluated using the Temple University Hospital EEG, which is the largest publicly available corpus of clinical EEG recordings in the world. This system automatically processes EEG records and classifies three patterns of clinical interest in brain activity that might be useful in diagnosing brain disorders: (1) spike and/or sharp waves, (2) generalized periodic epileptiform discharges, (3) periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges. It also classifies three patterns used to model the background EEG activity: (1) eye movement, (2) artifacts, and (3) background. Our approach delivers a sensitivity above 90% while maintaining a specificity below 5%. We also demonstrate that this system delivers a low false alarm rate, which is critical for any spike detection application.

An imbalanced learning model is proposed in this paper to improve the identification of seizure events in long-term EEG signals. To better represent the underlying microstructure distributions of EEG signals while preserving the non-stationary nature, discrete wavelet transform (DWI') and uniform 1D-LBP feature extraction procedure are introduced. A learning framework is then designed by the ensemble of weakly trained support vector machines (SVMs). Under-sampling is employed to split the imbalanced seizure and non-seizure samples into multiple balanced subsets where each of them is utilized to train an individual SVM classifier. The weak SVMs are incorporated to build a strong classifier which emphasizes seizure samples and in the meantime analyzing the unbalanced class distribution of EEG data. Final seizure detection results are obtained in a multi-level decision fusion process by considering temporal and frequency factors. The model was validated over two long-term and one short-term public EEG databases. The model achieved a G-mean of 97.14% with respect to epoch-level assessment, an event-level sensitivity of 96.67%, and a false detection rate of 0.86/h on the long-term intracranial database. An epoch-level G-mean of 95.28% and event-level false detection rate of 0.81/h were yielded over the long-term scalp database. The comparisons with 14 published methods demonstrated the improved detection performance for imbalanced EEG signals and the generalizability of the proposed model.

Thus, a virtuous cycle system that monitors a subject's drowsiness can improve work efficiency and safety. We propose a novel framework to detect instantaneous drowsiness with only a two-second length of electroencephalography (EEG). To achieve reliable performance, we use multitaper power spectral density for feature extraction along with extreme gradient boosting as a machine learning classifier. In addition, we introduce a novel phenotype labeling of instantaneous drowsiness by combining both task dependent and independent measures of alertness (psychomotor vigilance task and electrooculography technique, respectively). The results show that our techniques outperform others used in previous studies. We also identified which spectral components (theta, alpha, and gamma) and channels (Fp1, Fp2, T3, T4, O1, O2, and electrocardiogram) play important roles in our drowsiness detection framework. To verify the applicability for a mobile environment, we implemented our framework on a wireless EEG, as well as on a wired EEG. We hereby present our successful results.

However, using a more natural control scheme, such as decoding the trajectory of imagined 3D arm movements to move a prosthetic, robotic, or virtual arm has been reported in a limited amount of studies, all using offline feed-forward control schemes. Objective: In this study, we report the first attempt to realize online control of two virtual arms generating movements toward three targets/arm in 3D space. The 3D trajectory of imagined arm movements was decoded from power spectral density of mu, low beta, high beta, and low gamma EEG oscillations using multiple linear regression. The analysis was performed on a dataset recorded from three subjects in seven sessions wherein each session comprised three experimental blocks: an offline calibration block and two online feedback blocks. Target classification accuracy using predicted trajectories of the virtual arms was computed and compared with results of a filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) based multi-class classification method involving mutual information (MI) selection and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) modules. Main Results: Target classification accuracy from predicted trajectory of imagined 3D arm movements in the offline runs for two subjects (mean 45%, std 5%) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than chance level (33.3%). Nevertheless, the accuracy during real-time control of the virtual arms using the trajectory decoded directly from EEG was in the range of chance level (33.3%). However, the results of two subjects show that false-positive feedback may increase the accuracy in closed-loop. The FBCSP based multi-class classification method distinguished imagined movements of left and right arm with reasonable accuracy for two of the three subjects (mean 70%, std 5% compared to 50% chance level). However, classification of the imagined arm movement toward three targets was not successful with the FBCSP classifier as the achieved accuracy (mean 33%, std 5%) was similar to the chance level (33.3%). Sub-optimal components of the multi-session experimental paradigm were identified, and an improved paradigm proposed.

Its efficiency is largely determined by the feature extraction and selection techniques reducing the dimensionality of input data. Dimensionality reduction is usually implemented via the mathematical approaches (e.g., principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, etc.) regardless of the origin of analyzed data. We hypothesize that since EEG features are determined by certain neurophysiological processes, they should have distinctive characteristics in spatiotemporal domain. If so, it is possible to specify the set of EEG principal features based on the prior knowledge about underlying neurophysiological processes. To test this hypothesis, we consider the classification of EEG trials related to the perception of ambiguous visual stimuli. We observe that EEG features, underlying the different ambiguous stimuli interpretations, are defined by the network properties of neuronal activity. Having analyzed functional neural interactions, we specify the brain area in which neural network architecture exhibits differences for different classes of EEG trials. We optimize the feedforward multilayer perceptron and develop a strategy for the training set selection to maximize the classification accuracy, being 85% when all channels are used. The revealed localization of the percept-related features allows about 95% accuracy, when the number of channels is reduced up to 90%. Obtained results can be used for classification of EEG trials associated with more complex cognitive tasks. Taking into account that cognitive activity is subserved by a distributed functional cortical network, its topological properties have to be considered when selecting optimal features for EEG trial classification.

A female patient in CLIS participated in this study. She had not communicated even with her family for more than one year with complete loss of motor function. Offline and online experiments were conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed BCI system. In the offline experiment, we determined the best combination of mental tasks and the optimal classification strategy leading to the best performance. In the online experiment, we investigated whether our BCI system could be potentially used for real-time communication with the patient.ResultsAn online classification accuracy of 87.5% was achieved when Riemannian geometry-based classification was applied to real-time EEG data recorded while the patient was performing one of two mental-imagery tasks for 5s.ConclusionsOur results suggest that an EEG-based endogenous BCI has the potential to be used for online communication with a patient in CLIS.

In this new brain-machine interaction, the machine can actively decode the user's action observation and stop immediately if it detects that the user does not understand the intention of the action correctly. We measured brain activation using electroencephalography (EEG)-functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) bimodal measurement while 16 healthy participants observed three action tasks: drinking, moving a cup, and action with unclear intention. Complex brain networks were constructed for EEG and fNIRS data separately, and four network measures were chosen as features for classification. The obtained results revealed that the classification of three action observation tasks achieved accuracy of 72.3% using EEG-fNIRS confusion features, which was higher than that using fNIRS features (52.7%) or EEG features (68.6%) alone. Thus, the current findings suggested that our proposed method could provide a promising direction for brain-machine interface systems design.

Use of machine learning in predicting clinical response to transcranial magnetic stimulation in comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression: A resting state electroencephalography study	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Resting state EEG; Major depressive disorder; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Machine learning; Functional connectivity	EEG BIOMARKERS; RTMS TREATMENT; BRAIN-FUNCTION; CONNECTIVITY; METAANALYSIS; THETA; SYMPTOMS; CORDANCE; OUTCOMES; CORTEX	Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is clinically effective for major depressive disorder (MDD) and investigational for other conditions including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Understanding the mechanisms of TMS action and developing biomarkers predicting response remain important goals. We applied a combination of machine learning and electroencephalography (EEG), testing whether machine learning analysis of EEG coherence would (1) predict clinical outcomes in individuals with comorbid MDD and PTSD, and (2) determine whether an individual had received a TMS course. Methods: We collected resting-state 8-channel EEG before and after TMS (5 Hz to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). We used Lasso regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to test the hypothesis that baseline EEG coherence predicted the outcome and to assess if EEG coherence changed after TMS. Results: In our sample, clinical response to TMS were predictable based on pretreatment EEG coherence (n = 29). After treatment, 13/29 had more than 50% reduction in MDD self-report score 12/29 had more than 50% reduction in PTSD self-report score. For MDD, area under roc curve was for MDD was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.69-0.94) and for PTSD was 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.54-0.87). SVM classifier was able to accurately assign EEG recordings to pre- and post-TMS treatment. The accuracy for Alpha, Beta, Theta and Delta bands was 75.4 +/- 1.5%, 77.4 +/- 1.4%, 73.8 +/- 1.5%, and 78.6 +/- 1.4%, respectively, all significantly better than chance (50%, p < 0.001). Limitation: Limitations of this work include lack of sham condition, modest sample size, and a sparse electrode array. Despite these methodological limitations, we found validated and clinically meaningful results. Conclusions: Machine learning successfully predicted non-response to TMS with high specificity, and identified pre- and post-TMS status using EEG coherence. This approach may provide mechanistic insights and may also become a clinically useful screening tool for TMS candidates.

However, manual analysis of EEG data requires highly trained clinicians, and is a procedure that is known to have relatively low inter-rater agreement (IRA). Moreover, the volume of the data and the rate at which new data becomes available make manual interpretation a time-consuming, resource-hungry, and expensive process. In contrast, automated analysis of EEG data offers the potential to improve the quality of patient care by shortening the time to diagnosis and reducing manual error. In this paper, we focus on one of the first steps in interpreting an EEG session - identifying whether the brain activity is abnormal or normal. To address this specific task, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture termed ChronoNet which is inspired by recent developments from the field of image classification and designed to work efficiently with EEG data. ChronoNet is formed by stacking multiple 1D convolution layers followed by deep gated recurrent unit (GRU) layers where each 1D convolution layer uses multiple filters of exponentially varying lengths and the stacked GRU layers are densely connected in a feed-forward manner. We used the recently released TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus dataset for evaluating the performance of ChronoNet. Unlike previous studies using this dataset, ChronoNet directly takes time-series EEG as input and learns meaningful representations of brain activity patterns. ChronoNet outperforms previously reported results on this dataset thereby setting a new benchmark.

A critical review of current state-of-the-art in active learning approach for EEG classification by neural networks is the goal of this paper. Studies using active learning in EEG address detection of specific graphoelements (artifacts, VEPs, epileptic spikes) or stages (sleep stages, drowsiness) or they optimized brain computer interface (BCI). Amount of the training set in the studies is reduced compared to a common classifier used as a golden standard (reduction differs from 40% to 80% of the set size).

Recognizing seizure signals in intelligent way is quite important in clinical diagnosis of Epileptic seizure. Various traditional and deep machine learning techniques are employed for this purpose. However, the Epileptic seizure prediction and classification performance is not satisfactory over small EEG dataset using traditional approaches. The Transfer learning approach overcomes this by reusing the pre-trained networks such as googlenet, resnet101 and vgg19 trained on large Image database. This experiment has been done in two phases: (1) RGB image dataset generated for the seizure and non-seizure EEG signals data of University of Bonn using a novel preprocessing technique, (2) we configured googlenet, resnet101 and vgg19 trained networks to learn a new pattern or features from the RGB image Dataset and finally, above mentioned networks have been used for the classification. The use of Vgg19 network shows greater accuracy among the three but takes comparatively more prediction time. We will mainly emphasize on the results obtained from the googlenet, since it provides effective accuracy taking less time for prediction. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of above 99% for a smaller number of epochs and maximum accuracy of 100% when we increase number of epochs. Experimental outcomes show the proposed approach using googlent achieved better performance w.r.t to many state-of-the-art classification algorithms even on the small EEG dataset. In addition, classification performance of our proposed approach has compared with different traditional machine learning techniques over the same input data.

Alongside widespread use in image recognition, language processing, and data mining, machine learning techniques have received increasing attention in medical applications, ranging from automated imaging analysis to disease forecasting. This review examines the parallel progress made in epilepsy, highlighting applications in automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG), video, and kinetic data, automated imaging analysis and pre-surgical planning, prediction of medication response, and prediction of medical and surgical outcomes using a wide variety of data sources. A brief overview of commonly used machine learning approaches, as well as challenges in further application of machine learning techniques in epilepsy, is also presented. With increasing computational capabilities, availability of effective machine learning algorithms, and accumulation of larger datasets, clinicians and researchers will increasingly benefit from familiarity with these techniques and the significant progress already made in their application in epilepsy.

The aim of this study is to reveal whether EEG signals can be used for classifying cognitive processes: arithmetic tasks and text reading. A recently introduced EEG database, which is constructed from 18 healthy subjects during a slide show including 60 slides of simple arithmetic tasks and easily readable texts, is used for this purpose. Multi-order difference plot-based time-domain attributes, number of values in specified regions after scattering the sequential difference values with several degrees, are extracted. For classification, improved extreme learning machine (ELM) scheme, namely luELM, by the use of lower-upper triangularization method instead of singular value decomposition which has disadvantages when used with huge data is proposed. As a result, higher accuracy results are achieved with reduced training time for proposed luELM classifier than traditional ELM classifier for both subject-dependent and subject-independent analysis.

These limitations led to the development of multimodal neuroimaging (MN), which combines data obtained from multiple neuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and yields more detailed information about brain dynamics. There are several types of MN, including visual inspection, data integration, and data fusion. This literature review aimed to provide a brief summary and basic information about MN techniques (data fusion approaches in particular) and classification approaches. Data fusion approaches are generally categorized as asymmetric and symmetric. The present review focused exclusively on studies based on symmetric data fusion methods (data-driven methods), such as independent component analysis and principal component analysis. Machine learning techniques have recently been introduced for use in identifying diseases and biomarkers of disease. The machine learning technique most widely used by neuroscientists is classification-especially support vector machine classification. Several studies differentiated patients with psychiatric diseases and healthy controls with using combined datasets. The common conclusion among these studies is that the prediction of diseases increases when combining data via MN techniques; however, there remain a few challenges associated with MN, such as sample size. Perhaps in the future N-way fusion can be used to combine multiple neuroimaging techniques or nonimaging predictors (eg, cognitive ability) to overcome the limitations of MN.

If a robot can identify emotions and intentions of a human interacting with it, interactions with humans can potentially become more natural and effective. However, mechanisms of perception and empathy used by humans to achieve this understanding may not be suitable or adequate for use within robots. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for recording signals revealing emotions and motivations from a human brain. This study aimed to evaluate different machine learning techniques to classify EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states. For experimental purposes, we used visual (IAPS) and physical (Tower of Hanoi) tasks to record human emotional states in the form of EEG data. The obtained EEG data processed, formatted and evaluated using various machine learning techniques to find out which method can most accurately classify EEG data according to associated affective/emotional states. The experiment confirms the choice of a method for improving the accuracy of results. According to the results, Support Vector Machine was the first, and Regression Tree was the second best method for classifying EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states with accuracies up to 70.00% and 60.00%, respectively. In both tasks, SVM was better in performance than RT.

For the practical use, such algorithms must be robust to both device limitations and subject variability, which make MI classification a challenging task. This study proposes methods to study the effect of limitations including a limited number of electrodes, limited spatial distribution of electrodes, lower signal quality, subject variabilities and BCI literacy, on the performance of MI classification. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a machine learning approach, WaveCSP that uses 24 features extracted from EEG signals using wavelet transform and common spatial pattern (CSP) filtering techniques. The algorithm shows better performance in terms of subject variability compared to existing work. The application of WaveCSP to Physionet MI database shows more than 50% of the 109 subjects achieving accuracy higher than 64%. The data obtained from a commercial EEG headset using the same experimental protocol result in up to four out of five subjects who had prior BCI experience (out of a total of 25 subjects) performing with accuracy higher than 64%.

This includes the detection of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) in electroencephalography recordings. Here, we investigate the performance gain of a recurrent neural network (RNN) for CAP scoring in comparison to standard classification methods. We analyzed 15 recordings (n1-n15) from the publicly available CAP Sleep Database on Physionet to evaluate each machine learning method. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network increases the accuracy and F-1-score by 0.5-3.5% and 3.5-8%, respectively, compared to commonly used classification algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbour or feed-forward neural network. Our results show that by using a LSTM classifier the quantity of correctly detected CAP events can be increased and the number of wrongly classified periods reduced. RNNs significantly improve the precision in CAP scoring by taking advantage of available information from the past for deciding current classification.

Epilepsy, which is one of them, is a neurological disorder that affects a large number of people around the world and has a risk of causing injury of the patient in various ways. Instant monitoring of EEG signals is vital for the patient by providing notification of crisis detection in moments of vehicle / machine use. In this paper, a support vector machine based algorithm is used for the detection of epileptic attacks. In the study, EEG data sets corresponding to 23 non-crisis and crisis moments have been used. During the process of the EEG signals, wavelet transform, fourier transform, feature extraction and classification have been applied, respectively.

A precise system which can diagnose the depression levels based on the EEG signal would be useful support. This paper presents a machine learning approach to discriminate the depressed subjects to four different levels of depression, according to the Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) scores, besides the separability of different levels is investigated. In this way, we also proposed a fuzzy function based on neural network (FFNN) classifier. Our dataset contains EEG signals recorded from 60 depressed subjects with different levels of depression, under resting state, and EEG analysis was done using nonlinear features including fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), Katz fractal dimension (KFD) and fuzzy fractal dimension (FFD). The results indicate that KFD has a better capability in the prediction of the depression level. The proposed fuzzy classifier has demonstrated significant supremacy compared to support vector machine (SVM) in almost all experiments.

However, the kind of information the brain represents regarding the intended target during movement preparation remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated which movement parameters (i.e., direction, distance, and positions for reaching) can be decoded in premovement EEG decoding. Eight participants performed 30 types of reaching movements that consisted of 1 of 24 movement directions, 7 movement distances, 5 horizontal target positions, and 5 vertical target positions. Event-related spectral perturbations were extracted using independent components, some of which were selected via an analysis of variance for further binary classification analysis using a support vector machine. When each parameter was used for class labeling, all possible binary classifications were performed. Classification accuracies for direction and distance were significantly higher than chance level, although no significant differences were observed for position. For the classification in which each movement was considered as a different class, the parameters comprising two vectors representing each movement were analyzed. In this case, classification accuracies were high when differences in distance were high, the sum of distances was high, angular differences were large, and differences in the target positions were high. The findings further revealed that direction and distance may provide the largest contributions to movement. In addition, regardless of the parameter, useful features for classification are easily found over the parietal and occipital areas.

Fundamental properties of electroencephalography (EEG) constrain temporal resolutions for directly decoding movement kinematics, so estimating intention pertaining to movement, which would help us predict both long and short term human behaviors, may be an alternative solution for overcoming this issue. To estimate movement intention, recent studies found it helpful to consider hierarchical control between two distinctive learning strategies in reinforcement learning: a goal-directed and a habitual strategy. In the previous study, we suggested a proof of concept, called a model-based BCI framework, that can distinguish different learning strategies from electroencephalography (EEG) data. To advance this concept, we proposed intention decoders based on simple long short-term memory models (LSTM). To test the effect of intention estimation on prediction performance, we trained two versions of intention decoders: one with and the other without making use of underlying learning strategies decoded by the model-based BCI. The simulation results demonstrated that estimation performance of intention decoders with model-based BCI is significantly better (84%) than the one without model-based BCI (77%).

Normally, the severity of TBI is evaluated through the study from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unfortunately, the number of CT scanners and MRI scanners is limited. Therefore, it is impractical to directly do CT or MRI scan to all patients without screening. Thus, this research investigates a method for screening moderate TBI patient. Data from resting state 63-channels electroencephalography is used in this work. Power of the signal is extracted from alpha, beta, theta and gamma frequency bands. This work utilizes a support vector machine, which is one of machine learning approaches, to identify moderate TBI patients. From the experimental results, it is shown that the average power from alpha or theta band gives the best accuracy score, which is at 70.83%.

An intelligent emotion recognition system may provide a flexible method to monitor emotion changes in daily life and send warning information when unusual/unhealthy emotional states occur. Here, we proposed a novel unsupervised learning-based emotion recognition system in an attempt to decode emotional states from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Four dimensions of human emotions were examined: arousal, valence, dominance and liking. To better characterize the trials in terms of EEG features, we used hypergraph theory. Emotion recognition was realized through hypergraph partitioning, which divided the EEG-based hypergraph into a specific number of clusters, with each cluster indicating one of the emotion classes and vertices (trials) in the same cluster sharing similar emotion properties. Comparison of the proposed unsupervised learning-based emotion recognition system with other recognition systems using a well-known public emotion database clearly demonstrated the validity of the proposed system.

J	Bird, JJ; Ekart, A; Faria, DR				Bird, Jordan J.; Ekart, Aniko; Faria, Diego R.			On the effects of pseudorandom and quantum-random number generators in soft computing	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Quantum computing; Soft computing; Machine learning; Neural networks; Classification	COLONY OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL	In this work, we argue that the implications of pseudorandom and quantum-random number generators (PRNG and QRNG) inexplicably affect the performances and behaviours of various machine learning models that require a random input. These implications are yet to be explored in soft computing until this work. We use a CPU and a QPU to generate random numbers for multiple machine learning techniques. Random numbers are employed in the random initial weight distributions of dense and convolutional neural networks, in which results show a profound difference in learning patterns for the two. In 50 dense neural networks (25 PRNG/25 QRNG), QRNG increases over PRNG for accent classification at + 0.1%, and QRNG exceeded PRNG for mental state EEG classification by + 2.82%. In 50 convolutional neural networks (25 PRNG/25 QRNG), the MNIST and CIFAR-10 problems are benchmarked, and in MNIST the QRNG experiences a higher starting accuracy than the PRNG but ultimately only exceeds it by 0.02%. In CIFAR-10, the QRNG outperforms PRNG by + 0.92%. The n-random split of a Random Tree is enhanced towards and new Quantum Random Tree (QRT) model, which has differing classification abilities to its classical counterpart, 200 trees are trained and compared (100 PRNG/100 QRNG). Using the accent and EEG classification data sets, a QRT seemed inferior to a RT as it performed on average worse by - 0.12%. This pattern is also seen in the EEG classification problem, where a QRT performs worse than a RT by - 0.28%. Finally, the QRT is ensembled into a Quantum Random Forest (QRF), which also has a noticeable effect when compared to the standard Random Forest (RF). Ten to 100 ensembles of trees are benchmarked for the accent and EEG classification problems. In accent classification, the best RF (100 RT) outperforms the best QRF (100 QRF) by 0.14% accuracy. In EEG classification, the best RF (100 RT) outperforms the best QRF (100 QRT) by 0.08% but is extremely more complex, requiring twice the amount of trees in committee. All differences are observed to be situationally positive or negative and thus are likely data dependent in their observed functional behaviour.

A machine learning approach is proposed here to perform activity recognition (overground walking vs rest) using muscles or brain activity. EMG and EEG signals were preprocessed, features in the frequency domain were extracted and the achieved decoding accuracy was around 90%. Although extensive validation is still required, the results constitute a first step towards the goal of predicting gait initiation in real life.

J	Salyers, JB; Dong, Y; Gai, Y				Salyers, Jacob B.; Dong, Yue; Gai, Yan			Continuous Wavelet Transform for Decoding Finger Movements From Single-Channel EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; finger; sensory motor rhythms; wavelet transform; slow cortical potentials		Human body movements can be reflected in brain signals and collected noninvasively with electroencephalography (EEG). Motor-related signals include sensory motor rhythms (also known as the Mu wave) in the upper-alpha band of 8-13 Hz and slow cortical potentials (SCPs) in the low frequency range of 0.1-5 Hz. This study compares the two signals for decoding finger movements. Human subjects were asked to individually lift each of the five digits of their right hand, at the rate of one every 10 s. EEG was recorded using a bipolar montage between ipsilateral and contralateral motor cortices. Electromyograms were obtained for identifying movement onsets. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) generated significant performance with SCPs but not with Mu. Meanwhile, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was applied to SCPs or Mu to create a spectrogram for each finger, showing distinctive amplitude and phase patterns. A dprime-based weighting algorithm was used to extract time-frequency features. With a template-matching paradigm, both SCP and Mu spectrograms yielded significant classification accuracies for multiple subjects, with the highest being >50% (chance = 20%). Interestingly, the index finger was better distinguished with Mu for most of the subjects, whereas the ring finger was better distinguished with SCPs. The CWT algorithm outperformed LDA by better decoding the thumb. This study suggests that the time-frequency characteristics of a single-channel EEG, when phase is preserved, contain critical information on finger movements. SCPs and Mu seem to work in an independent but complementary manner.

However, exploiting pre-execution brain activity related to movement intention could improve the practical applicability of BMIs. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether EEG signals occurring before movement execution could be used to classify movement intention. Six subjects performed reaching tasks that required them to move a cursor to one of four targets distributed horizontally and vertically from the center. Using independent components of EEG acquired during a premovement phase, two-class classifications were performed for left vs. right trials and top vs. bottom trials using a support vector machine. Instructions were presented visually (test) and aurally (condition). In the test condition, accuracy for a single window was about 75%, and it increased to 85% in classification using two windows. In the control condition, accuracy for a single window was about 73%, and it increased to 80% in classification using two windows. Classification results showed that a combination of two windows from different time intervals during the premovement phase improved classification performance in the both conditions compared to a single window classification. By categorizing the independent components according to spatial pattern, we found that information depending on the modality can improve classification performance. We confirmed that EEG signals occurring during movement preparation can be used to control a BMI.

We explore the use of BMI for implementing electroencephalography for recording electrical activity of the brain. In this paper, we focus on developing a prototype that uses BMI to extract the current mood of the human brain. A BMI/BCI system provides a new method of communication to the brain through the computer. The brain consists of billions of neurons and these neurons communicate via minute electrochemical impulses which generate movement, expressions, emotions and words. Mental activity leads to changes of electrophysiological signals. Brain-computer interface (BCI) takes the input through the brain and link it to the device for some external activity, such as body movement, intelligence. The system opens a pathway for connecting the human brain and the matter that to be inhabited and is also helpful for treatment of severely paralyzed or locked-in people.

EEG has the advantage of being non-invasive in nature, easy to use, and effective in capturing signals in the mu (7-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) bands during motor imagery tasks. However, EEG recordings are more susceptible to movement artifacts and capture a lower frequency of neural activity when compared with invasive techniques such as electrocorticography (ECoG) or intracranial EEG (iEEG). In this paper, we analyze the performance of four different EEG motor imagery classification algorithms (both classical machine learning methods and deep learning-based methods) on a two-hand motor imagery task using both EEG and iEEG data sets. Using various feature visualization techniques, we provide insight into why deep learning-based classifiers designed to learn features end-to-end may perform better than the classical machine learning-based models. We also showed on average iEEG-based motor imagery BCIs, using our iEEG data set, do not perform as well as EEG-based BCIs. This work provides a starting point for the implementation of BCI applications using iEEG data.

From Group-Level Statistics to Single-Subject Prediction: Machine Learning Detection of Concussion in Retired Athletes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Event-related potentials; brain injury; electroencephalography; EEG; concussions; machine learning; explainable models	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LONG-TERM; INTERNATIONAL-CONFERENCE; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; SPORT HELD; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; REDUCTION; DEFICITS; HISTORY	There has been increased effort to understand the neurophysiological effects of concussion aimed to move diagnosis and identification beyond current subjective behavioral assessments that suffer from poor sensitivity. Recent evidence suggests that event-related potentials (ERPs) measured with electroencephalography (EEG) are persistent neurophysiological markers of past concussions. However, as such evidence is limited to group-level analyzes, the extent to which they enable concussion detection at the individual-level is unclear. One promising avenue of research is the use of machine learning to create quantitative predictive models that can detect prior concussions in individuals. In this paper, we translate the recent group-level findings from ERP studies of concussed individuals into a machine learning framework for performing single-subject prediction of past concussion. We found that a combination of statistics of single-subject ERPs and wavelet features yielded a classification accuracy of 81% with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 80%, improving on current practice. Notably, the model was able to detect concussion effects in individuals who sustained their last injury as much as 30 years earlier. However, failure to detect past concussions in a subset of individuals suggests that the clear effects found in group-level analyses may not provide us with a full picture of the neurophysiological effects of concussion.

New method: This paper aims at devising a novel non-invasive method of measuring human intelligence. A newly devised scoring scheme is used to ultimately generate a score for the subjects. Wavelet packet transform approach for feature extraction is applied to 5 channel EEG data. This approach uses db-8 as the mother wavelet. Hierarchical extreme learning machine is used for classification of the EEG signals. Result: 80.00% training accuracy and 73.33% testing accuracy was measured for the classifier. The average sensitivity and specificity across all three classes was measured to be 0.8133 and 0.8923 respectively. An aggregate score was determined from the classification of EEG data. The power spectral analysis of the EEG data was conducted and regions of the brain responsible for various activities was confirmed. In the memory test, theta and beta bands exhibit high power, for arithmetic test, alpha and beta bands are strong, whereas in linguistic test, theta, alpha and beta bands are equally strong. Comparison: The traditional IQ test determines intelligence indirectly, based on the score obtained from Wechsler test. In this paper an attempt is made to measure intelligence based on various brain activities - memory, arithmetic, linguistic. Conclusion: A new method to measure intelligence using direct approach by classifying the EEG signals is proposed.	[Kadam, Shashikant T.; Dhaimodker, Vineet M.

Despite the effective application of deep learning (DL) in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, the successful execution of this technique, especially for inter-subject classification, in cognitive BCI has not been accomplished yet. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the attentive mental state from single-channel raw electroencephalography (EEG) data. Approach. We develop an end-to-end deep CNN to decode the attentional information from an EEG time series. We also explore the consequences of input representations on the performance of deep CNN by feeding three different EEG representations into the network. To ensure the practical application of the proposed framework and avoid time-consuming re-training, we perform inter-subject transfer learning techniques as a classification strategy. Eventually, to interpret the learned attentional patterns, we visualize and analyse the network perception of the attention and non-attention classes. Main results. The average classification accuracy is 79.26%, with only 15.83% of 120 subjects having an accuracy below 70% (a generally accepted threshold for BCI). This is while with the inter-subject approach, it is literally difficult to output high classification accuracy. This end-to-end classification framework surpasses conventional classification methods for attention detection. The visualization results demonstrate that the learned patterns from the raw data are meaningful. Significance. This framework significantly improves attention detection accuracy with inter-subject classification. Moreover, this study sheds light on the research on end-to-end learning; the proposed network is capable of learning from raw data with the least amount of pre-processing, which in turn eliminates the extensive computational load of time-consuming data preparation and feature extraction.

Reduce Calibration Time in Motor Imagery Using Spatially Regularized Symmetric Positives-Definite Matrices Based Classification	SENSORS			English	Article						motor imagery; symmetric positives definite matrices; brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); Riemannian manifold	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; PATTERN; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) requires large number of subject specific training trials to calibrate the system for a new subject. This results in long calibration time that limits the BCI usage in practice. One major challenge in the development of a brain-computer interface is to reduce calibration time or completely eliminate it. To address this problem, existing approaches use covariance matrices of electroencephalography (EEG) trials as descriptors for decoding BCI but do not consider the geometry of the covariance matrices, which lies in the space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. This inevitably limits their performance. We focus on reducing calibration time by introducing SPD based classification approach. However, SPD-based classification has limited applicability in small training sets because the dimensionality of covariance matrices is large in proportion to the number of trials. To overcome this drawback, our paper proposes a new framework that transforms SPD matrices in lower dimension through spatial filter regularized by prior information of EEG channels. The efficacy of the proposed approach was validated on the small sample scenario through Dataset IVa from BCI Competition III. The proposed approach achieved mean accuracy of and mean kappa of on Dataset IVa. The proposed method outperformed other approaches in existing studies on Dataset IVa. Finally, to ensure the robustness of the proposed method, we evaluated it on Dataset IIIa from BCI Competition III and Dataset IIa from BCI Competition IV. The proposed method achieved mean accuracy and on Dataset IIIa and Dataset IIa, respectively.

Through the analysis of various feature extraction methods, this article finally selects Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) and wavelet packet analysis (WPA) to extract the feature and uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify and compare these extracted features. For the EEG data provided by GRAZ University, the accuracy rate of feature extraction using CSP algorithm is 85.5%, and the accuracy rate of feature extraction using wavelet packet analysis is 92%. Then this paper analyzes the EEG data collected by Emotiv epoc+ system. The classification accuracy of wavelet packet extracted features can still be maintained at more than 80%, while the classification accuracy of CSP extracted feature is decreased obviously. Experimental results show that the method of wavelet packet analysis towards competition data and Emotiv epoc+ system data can both get a desirable outcome.

Exploring complexity of the system can be contributed to understand diverse neurophysiological abnormalities, which may further result in different kinds of neurological disorders. In this paper, we present a novel analyzing framework to characterize the complexity of neurophysiological system, under which a specific weighted FPE-complexity-based feature (W-FPE-F) is extracted from EEG and then applied into the automated epileptic seizure detection. Combining with extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM), performances of the proposed method are finally verified on two open EEG databases. Simulation results show that the proposed method does a good job in detecting the epileptic seizure, particularly, it is able to avoid the undesirable detection performance caused by individual divergence effectively.

For instance, it can be used for post-stroke motor rehabilitation in order to restore part of the motor control of someone injured in an accident. The BCI process involves the signal acquisition and preprocessing of data, extraction and selection of features, and classification. Thus, in order to have a correct classification of the movements, several filters are commonly used to handle the signal data. Here we propose the use of Differential Evolution (DE) with cross-entropy as the objective function to find an appropriate filter. Computational experiments are performed using 2 datasets from BCI competitions for motor imagery with signals of Bipolar and Monopolar Electroencephalography. Also, these problems involve two-class and multiclass classifications. The results show that the proposed DE obtained mean results 9.85% better than the well-known approach Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern for BCIs with 2 classes for bipolar signals, and it allows for the reduction of the number of electrodes for BCIs with 4 classes.

However, the large numbers of time series make it quite challenging to establish a high performance automatic detection method. Considering different physiological states of the brain could be characterized by distinct combinations or interactions of similar discontinuous local temporal patterns, a novel framework based on biclustering for automatic epileptic seizure detection is proposed in this paper. First, the CC algorithm is used to identify similar discontinuous local temporal patterns. Then, the bicluster membership matrix using a new similarity measurement is constructed to reduce the dimensionality. At last, the ELM classifier is adopted to discriminate between epileptic seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. With extensive comparative studies and evaluations on the publicly available Bonn epileptic EEG dataset, it indicates that the proposed framework could not only automatically detect or predict an epilepsy seizure with high performances with respect to accuracy, robustness and efficiency, but also implicitly provide valuable knowledge for studying the mechanisms of epilepsy.

Testing for the neuroadaptive system utilized a G.nautilus headset, MATLAB with the EEGLAB toolbox, and a computer with the Processing IDE. Code from the Processing IDE provides an image slideshow which displays faces of various individuals so that the subject presses a keyboard key on a certain image. Three subjects were tested for 60 trials each, 30 trials where the keyboard key was pressed, and 30 trials where they were not, to gather enough data to train and test a classifier by using a machine learning algorithm. Machine learning assessed classification accuracy initially using 10 training trials and increased the training set by 10 trials each time to reassess accuracy until a total of 40 training trials were used. A set of 20 trials were used to assess accuracy without and with machine learning. Additionally, theoretical accuracy was computed by removing unfeasible machine learning features to assess the potential accuracy in a real-time system. The results provided an average accuracy of 52% without machine learning and an average accuracy ranging from 91.66% to 96.66% using the K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) algorithm. The average theoretical accuracy ranged from to be 60% to 68.33%.

To assist such systems, electroencephalography (EEG) based measures play an important role. In this study, the publicly available database of emotion analysis using physiological signals, has been used to identify the human emotions such as valence (positive/negative) from the given recorded EEG signals. With the identification of such emotion, the feeling of goodness or badness related individual experiences with the situation can be identified from his/her brain signals. The different machine learning classifiers such as random forest, decisions trees, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, naive Bayes and neural network have been used to identify and evaluate such emotions. The previous work done by the other authors on the same dataset using various quantitative approaches are compared with the approaches used in this study yields higher accuracy rates with the random forest and decision tree. The effectiveness of each classifier in terms of statistical measures such as accuracy, F-score, etc. has been evaluated. The random forest classifier was found to outperform with an accuracy of 98%, closely followed by the Decision tree at 94% are the most effective classifiers in classifying the valence emotions of the EEG data for 6 subjects.

Improved Decoding of EEG-Based Motor Imagery Using Convolutional Neural Network and Data Space Adaptation	2019 IEEE EMBS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL & HEALTH INFORMATICS (BHI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	MAY 19-22, 2019	Univ Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL	IEEE, IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc, GeorgiaTech, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Emory Univ, G Tec, Univ Illinois Urbana Champaign, Healthcare Engn Syst Ctr, Starkey Hearing Technologies, AMIA, NSF	Univ Illinois Chicago			One challenge in decoding EEG-based motor imagery for brain computer interface (BCI) is the inter-session non-stationarities due to factors like subject fatigue or electrode placements. This non stationarity leads to lower decoding accuracy, especially if data from the training and testing sessions are collected on separate days. An existing technique termed data space adaptation (DSA) transforms EEG data such that the distribution of test and training data are aligned. Decoding accuracy has been shown to improve when transformed data was used for classification instead of the original data. In this study, space transformed data from six subjects were fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) model. The results show that when no adaptation was applied, there was on average a 2.8% improvement in decoding accuracy when CNN was used compared to FBCSP. When DSA was used in conjunction with FBCSP, the majority of the subjects had improved decoding accuracy. However, DSA together with CNN on average yielded a lower decoding accuracy compared to CNN alone. Hence the results suggest that when decoding non-stationary EEG data for motor imagery, DSA should be used only in conjunction with FBCSP, but not when CNN is used as a decoding model.

We introduce different preprocessing and feature extraction algorithms for this purpose and develop an algorithm that selects features by their feature importance. This selection is used as an evaluation measure for features, their preprocessing algorithms and the EEG electrodes. Our results show that most influential features for signal interpretation are: common spatial patterns, fractal dimensions, as well as, variance and standard deviation of the preprocessed data. We show that preprocessing with continuous wavelet transforms outperforms the other tested preprocessing algorithms. Furthermore, we show that high gamma frequencies (70-90 Hz) contain more information than the lower mu-rhythms (8-12 Hz) where event-related-desynchronization (ERD) is known to occur. The important EEG electrodes for this classification task are located in the left and right back of the motor-cortex. The proposed algorithm can be further used to create subject-specific and performance models for real-time classification.

Among those mental strategies are the EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms. Furthermore, recognized patterns can be used as a source of information for communication to operate devices of BCI. Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) is a BCI paradigm that uses EEG brain responses when a subject focuses on a visual stimuli (flickering stimuli). Decoding SSVEP signals refers to identify what stimulus the user focuses on, which could be used as a command for communication or control. The minimum energy combination (MEC) and canonical correlation analysis methods (CCA) have been used in SSVEP-based BCIs due to its high efficiency, robustness, and simple implementation. In the last years, variants of CCA-based SSVEP methods have been reported in literature to improve classification and usability such as filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA). This paper evaluates the MEC, CCA and FBCCA methods for decoding commands from EEG signals in a SSVEP-based BCI application. It was carried out a set of experiments with five subjects which consist of four flickering stimuli (6.66, 7.5, 8.57 and 10 Hz) showed on a LED monitor. The results showed, for an epoch of 3 s, that CCA and FBCCA methods were able to detect SSVEP with high accuracy: 92.6% for FBCCA and 91.4% for CCA. The classification accuracy was 86.1% for MEC. As future work, FBCCA method will be used to decode user intention to control a closed-loop system based on EEG-triggered FES to restore hand grasp function.

A two-step feature extraction strategy is proposed. In the first step, the EEG data is segmented into sequences of quasi-stationary intervals, during which functional networks sustain their connectivity. The second step localizes the functional networks during each segment, to generate the dynamic functional connectivity graphs. Next, the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is employed to select features for the classification problem. To take advantage of the dynamic nature of the generated graphs, a long short term memory (LSTM) classifier is used for classification.

Usually, in Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI experiment protocols, different mental tasks are performed to elicit unique brain signal responses, which are recognized by signal processing and machine learning methods. The work presented in this paper extracts the EEG phase synchrony feature called Phase Lock Value (PLV) to decode Motor Imagery (MI) of center-out hand movement in right and left directions. At first, PLV features of all the EEG channel pairs are extracted to detect the level of synchronization corresponding to the directional hand movements. The most significant channel pairs selected from direction-specific EEG signals corresponding to the imagined hand movement showed characteristic changes in PLV features. Mean Percentage Difference of PLV features are calculated and compared in different frequency bands to identify the most discriminative frequency band for the hand movement classification. The extracted PLV features offer 5.34% improvement in classification accuracy for the 7 best performing subjects compared to the relevant method in literature.	[Benzy, V. K.; Vinod, A.

EEG is a signal acquisition tool from cerebral electrical discharges. Recently Khouma [1] has proposed a tool to detect the Interictical Paroxystic Events (IPE) or spikes in EEG signals. In this paper, we propose a new classification method of spikes morphology based on the Support Vector Machines (SVM). The SVM is a supervised classification method using kernel functions. It is a powerful technique and particularly useful for data whose distribution is unknown (EEG signals). We apply this technique to identify the different spikes morphologies in EEG signals. Different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial and sigmoidal) are used for experimental. Automatic treatment for identification spikes morphology could improve the diagnosis of epilepsy.

Using EEG to monitor people's cognitive workload means a lot, especially for tasks demanding high attention. Before deep neural networks became a research hotspot, the use of spectrum information and the common spatial pattern algorithm (CSP) was the most popular method to classify EEG-based cognitive workloads. Recently, spectral maps have been combined with deep neural networks to achieve a final accuracy of 91.1% across four levels of cognitive workload. In this study, a parallel mechanism of spectral feature-enhanced maps is proposed which enhances the expression of structural information that may be compressed by inter- and intra-subject differences. A public dataset and milestone neural networks, such as AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet are used to measure the effectiveness of this approach. As a result, the classification accuracy is improved from 91.10% to 93.71%.

It is hypothesized that the CNS might use kinematic synergies to reduce the complexity of movements, but how these kinematic synergies are encoded in the CNS remains unclear. In order to investigate the neural representations of kinematic synergies, scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and hand kinematics were recorded from ten subjects during six representative types of hand grasping. Kinematic synergies were obtained from recorded hand kinematics using singular value decomposition. The recorded kinematics were then reconstructed using weighted linear combinations of synergies, and the optimal weights were computed using optimal linear estimation. Using EEG spectral powers as neural features, a multivariate linear regression model was trained on the weights of the kinematic synergies. Using this model, kinematics from the testing subset of data was decoded from the EEG features with threefold cross-validation. The results show that the weights of kinematic synergies used in a particular movement reconstruction were strongly correlated to EEG features obtained from that movement. EEG features were able to successfully decode synergy-based movements with an average decoding accuracy of 80.1 +/- 6.1% (best up to 93.4 +/- 2.3%). These results have promising applications in noninvasive neural control of synergy-based prostheses and exoskeletons.

Researchers have successfully used Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to predict user intent from EEG. Frequency bands between 8 to 40 Hz, with 4 Hz intervals are used as inputs to FBCSP classification. While this range includes the commonly used alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) frequency bands, it excludes the delta band (0.3-3 Hz). The delta band has been shown to contain information regarding user intent. This paper investigates the accuracy of predicting user intent to reach and lift when modifying FBCSP to include combinations of alpha, beta and delta bands. This comparison was performed for clinical (32-electrodes) and commercial (12-electrodes) EEG electrode configurations using the WAY-EEG-GAL dataset. The simulated commercial configuration placement mimicked those from the Emotiv Epoc+. We predicted intent to reach (HandStart) and lift a block (LiftOff) by comparing the EEG signal to rest conditions. Intent classification accuracy is the accuracy to predict the future event before the event occurs. Maximum classification accuracy is the maximum accuracy to predict the event during the region of interest (-2.5, -2.0 sec.). Intent classification accuracy of 80.2% and 76.7% were achieved for the clinical and commercial configurations, respectively. Maximum classification accuracy of 85.9% and 83.0% were achieved for the clinical and commercial configuration, respectively. The combination of all three bands outperformed alpha-beta-only and delta-only by 0.9% and 9.9% for the clinical and 4.0% and 4.3% for the commercial for maximum classification accuracy. Using the combination of bands resulted in a maximum classification above 80% for the commercial configuration. These results suggest that including the delta frequency band can help improve the accuracy of user intent in clinical and commercial headsets.

However, the existing IIC classification techniques are shown to be not accurate and robust enough for clinical use because of the lack of high quality labels of EEG segments as training data. Obtaining high-quality labeled data is traditionally a manual process by trained clinicians that can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. In this work, we propose Smile, an industrial scale system that provides an end-to-end solution to the IIC pattern classification problem. The core components of Smile include a visualization-based time series labeling module and a deep-learning based active learning module. The labeling module enables the users to explore and label 350 million EEG segments (30TB) at interactive speed. The multiple coordinated views allow the users to examine the EEG signals from both time domain and frequency domain simultaneously. The active learning module first trains a deep neural network that automatically extracts both the local features with respect to each segment itself and the long term dynamics of the EEG signals to classify IIC patterns. Then leveraging the output of the deep learning model, the EEG segments that can best improve the model are selected and prompted to clinicians to label. This process is iterated until the clinicians and the models show high degree of agreement. Our initial experimental results show that our Smile system allows the clinicians to label the EEG segments at will with a response time below 500 ms. The accuracy of the model is progressively improved as more and more high quality labels are acquired over time.

Current NF systems enable the selection of only one NF parameter, so that two parameters cannot be feedback simultaneously. Consequently, the ability to individually-tailor the treatment to a patient is limited, and treatment efficiency may therefore be compromised. We aimed to design, implement and test an all-in-one, novel, computerized platform for closed-loop NF treatment, based on principles from learning theories. Our prototype performs numeric evaluation based on quantifying resting EEG and event-related EEG responses to various sensory stimuli. The NF treatment was designed according to principles of efficient learning, and implemented as a gradual, patient-adaptive 1D or 2D computer game, that utilizes automatic EEG feature extraction. Verification was performed as we compared the mean area under curve (AUC) of the theta band of a dozen subjects staring at a wall or performing the NF. Most of the subjects (75%) increased their theta band AUC during the NF session compared with the trial staring at the wall (p=0.041). Our system enables multiple feature selection and its machine learning capabilities allow an accurate discovery of patient-specific biomarkers and treatment targets. Its novel characteristics may allow for improved evaluation of patients and treatment outcomes.

The effectiveness of CSP is highly affected by the frequency band and time window of EEG segments. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize the spectral bands of CSP, most of them selected the time window in a heuristic way. This is likely to result in a suboptimal feature extraction since the time period when the brain responses to the mental tasks occurs may not be accurately detected. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern (TSGSP), for the simultaneous optimization of filter bands and time window within CSP to further boost classification accuracy of MI EEG. Specifically, spectrum-specific signals are first derived by bandpass filtering from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping filter bands. Each of the spectrum-specific signals is further segmented into multiple subseries using sliding window approach. We then devise a joint sparse optimization of filter bands and time windows with temporal smoothness constraint to extract robust CSP features under a multitask learning framework. A linear support vector machine classifier is trained on the optimized EEG features to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, BCI Competition IV datasets IIa, and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb) to validate the effectiveness of TSGSP in comparison to several other competing methods. Superior classification performance (averaged accuracies are 88.5%, 83.3%, and 84.3% for the three datasets, respectively) based on the experimental results confirms that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of MI-based BCIs.

Three classification models were implemented and assessed to decode EEG motor imagery signals: (i) Morphological-Linear Neural Network (MLNN) (ii) Support Vector Machine (SVM) and (iii) Multilayer perceptron (MLP). Real EEG signals recorded during robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in the classification of three classes ( relax, movement intention A Int A and movement intention B Int B) using multi-CSP based features extracted from EEG signals. The results of a ten-fold cross validation show similar results in terms of classification accuracy for the SVM and MLNN models. However, the number of parameters used in each model varies considerably (the MLNN model use less parameters than the SVM). This study indicates potential application of MLNNs for decoding movement intentions and its use to develop more natural and intuitive robot assisted neurorehabilitation therapies.

Fully reconstruction of upper limb movement from brain signals is one of the critical issues for intuitive BCI. However, decoding of forearm rotation from imagined movements using electroencephalography (EEG) is difficult to decode degree of rotation accurately. In this paper, we reconstructed imagined forearm rotation from low-frequency (0.3-3 Hz) of EEG signals. We selected 20 EEG channel on motor cortex for analysis. Ten healthy subjects participated in our experiment. The subjects performed actual and imagined forearm rotation to reach different targets. We trained a reconstruction decoder which used the EEG signals measured from actual movements and the kinematic information only. Additionally, we applied a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to enhance decoding performances. As a result, we achieved the high correlation performance (Average: 0.67) to decode imagined forearm rotation angle. This result has demonstrated that the reconstruction decoder which is trained by the EEG data from actual movement has effective to decode robustly for the imagined forearm rotation angle.

Decoding motion direction using the topography of sustained ERPs and alpha oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Decoding; Motion perception; EEG; ERPs; Alpha-band oscillations	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; PERCEPTUAL DECISION; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; REPRESENTATION; ARTIFACTS; MULTIPLE; TRACKING; MEG	The present study sought to determine whether scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain decodable information about the direction of motion in random dot kinematograms (RDKs), in which the motion information is spatially distributed and mixed with random noise. Any direction of motion from 0 to 360 degrees was possible, and observers reported the precise direction of motion at the end of a 1500-ms stimulus display. We decoded the direction of motion separately during the motion period (during which motion information was being accumulated) and the report period (during which a shift of attention was necessary to make a fine-tuned direction report). Machine learning was used to decode the precise direction of motion (within +/- 11.25 degrees) from the scalp distribution of either alpha-band EEG activity or sustained event-related potentials (ERPs). We found that ERP-based decoding was above chance (1/16) during both the stimulus and the report periods, whereas alpha-based decoding was above chance only during the report period. Thus, sustained ERPs contain information about spatially distributed direction-of-motion, providing a new method for observing the accumulation of sensory information with high temporal resolution.

One of the major concerns in BCI is to have a high classification accuracy. The other concerning one is with the favorable result is guaranteed how to improve the computational efficiency. In this paper, Mu/Beta rhythm was obtained by bandpass filter from EEG signal. And the classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used for deciding which rhythm can give the better classification performance. During this, the common spatial pattern (CSP) was used to project data subject to the ratio of projected energy of one class to that of the other class was maximized. The optimal projection dimension was determined corresponding to the maximum of area under the curve (AUC) for each participant. Eventually, regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) is possible to decode the imagined motor sensed using electroencephalogram (EEG). Results show that higher classification accuracy can be provided by RLDA. And optimal projection dimensions determined by LDA and RLDA are of consistent solution, this improves computational efficiency of CSP-RLDA method without computation of projection dimension.

EEG and cardiotocography (CTG) data were obtained from 10 parturient women during their first stage of labour. The study subjects reported the extent of their pain experienced due to uterine contractions, which were recorded by the CTG tracing. Simultaneous 16-channel EEG traces were obtained for spectral analysis and a subsequent machine learning classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) aiming to predict the pain experienced in relation to uterine contractions. It was found that pain due to uterine contraction correlated positively with relative delta and beta band activities and negatively with relative theta and alpha band activities of the EEG signals. SVM using the spectral activities, statistical and non-linear features of the EEG classified the state of pain with 83% accuracy using a classification model generalizable across subjects. Furthermore, dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) successfully reduced the number of features used in the classification while achieving a maximum classification accuracy of 84%. Continuous EEG affords the means to assess objectively maternal pain experienced during the active contraction phase of the first stage of labour. Monitoring of the pain experience using EEG signals may complement the clinical decision-making process behind administration of epidural anaesthesia during labour. We envision future studies to investigate EEG markers of pain in other clinical states, aiming to generalize the use of EEG as an objective method of pain assessment.

The objective of this work is to use the capability of spiking neural networks to capture the spatio-temporal information encoded in time-series signals and decode them without the use of hand-crafted features and vector-based learning and the realization of the spiking model on low-power neuromorphic hardware. Approach. The NeuCube spiking model was used to classify different grasp movements directly from raw surface electromyography signals (sEMG), the estimations of the applied finger forces as well as the classification of two motor imagery movements from raw electroencephalography (EEG). In a parallel investigation, the designed spiking decoder was implemented on SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware, which allows low-energy real-time processing. Main results. Experimental results reveal a better classification accuracy using the NeuCube model compared to traditional machine learning methods. For sEMG classification, we reached a training accuracy of 85% and a test accuracy of 84.8%, as well as less than 19% of relative root mean square error (rRMSE) when estimating finger forces from six subjects. For the EEG classification, a mean accuracy of 75% was obtained when tested on raw EEG data from nine subjects from the existing 2b dataset from 'Bel competition IV'. Significance. This work provides a proof of concept for a successful implementation of the NeuCube spiking model on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic platform for raw sEMG and EEG decoding, which could chart a route ahead for a new generation of portable closed-loop and low-power neuroprostheses.

However, studies on the use of EEG signals in brain computer interface (BBA) applications are increasing. It is possible to control machines using only mental activities, especially for patients with limited mobility. Motor imagery signals (MIS) which are formed as a result of the imagination of moving a limb are one of the most common signal used for this purpose. In this study, it is aimed to classify MIS signals with Convolutional Neural Network by using BCI-IV 2b dataset. As a result, higher (%75,7) performance was obtained with lower number of parameters compared to similar previous studies.

An EEG-based computer cursor control task is commonly used as a testbed for BCI applications. While traditional computer cursor control schemes are based on sensorimotor rhythm, a new scheme has recently been developed using imagined body kinematics (IBK) to achieve natural cursor movement in a shorter time of training. This article attempts to explore optimal decoding algorithms for an IBK paradigm using EEG signals with application to neural cursor control. The study is based on an offline analysis of 32 healthy subjects' training data. Various machine learning techniques were implemented to predict the kinematics of the computer cursor using EEG signals during the training tasks. Our results showed that a linear regression least squares model yielded the highest goodness-of-fit scores in the cursor kinematics model (70 in horizontal prediction and 40 in vertical prediction using a Theil-Sen regressor). Additionally, the contribution of each EEG channel on the predictability of cursor kinematics was examined for horizontal and vertical directions, separately. A directional classifier was also proposed to classify horizontal versus vertical cursor kinematics using EEG signals. By incorporating features extracted from specific frequency bands, we achieved 80 classification accuracy in differentiating horizontal and vertical cursor movements. The findings of the current study could facilitate a pathway to designing an optimized online neural cursor control.

Getting enough sleep at the right times can help protect mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety. In this study, an electroencephalography (EEG)-based machine-learning approach is proposed to measure sleep quality. The advantages of our approach over standard Polysomnography (PSG) method are: 1) it measures sleep quality by recognizing three sleep categories rather than five sleep stages, thus higher accuracy can be expected; 2) three sleep categories are recognized by analyzing EEG signals only using two EEG electrodes, so the user experience is improved because he/she is attached with fewer sensors during sleep. Using quantitative features obtained from EEG signals, we developed a new automatic sleep-staging framework that consists of a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification based on a decision tree approach. We used polysomnographic data from PhysioBank database to train and evaluate the performance of the framework, where the sleep stages have been visually annotated. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves high classification performance, which helps to measure sleep quality accurately.

It brings a higher availability, sustainability and performance. However, specifics of different research areas require development of customized solutions for individual research domains. For example, electroencephalography and event-related potentials (EEG/ERP) use specific devices, data formats and machine learning workflows. As a solution, a cloud-based system for the EEG/ERP domain containing a distributed data storage, a signal processing method library and a client GUI is presented. The signal processing method library is used for training of classifiers and classifying the data in the cloud-based system controlled by the GUI. The presented system was tested using a machine learning workflow based on the data stored in the system. In the workflow, various classifiers were trained and their parameters stored into the system. Finally, testing data were classified using previously trained classifiers.

Therefore this paper focus on the BCI based on motor imagery, which is a popular studied spontaneous EEG, producing without external stimulus. 6 healthy people participate in the examination, 5 of which are saved while one of which is thrown due to disturbing. Independent component correlation algorithm (ICA) was used to extract motor related component, meanwhile other filters also designed for better signal quality. Taking the motor related components PSD distribution after ICA as features, signal modal decoding based on reinforcement learning is processed in two algorithms. Both of them have good performance. Finally, on-line decoding model is descripted on the basis of the off-line decoding model. The result shows the accuracy of training model has significant difference with random level. Furthermore, the conclusion can be developed into human-computer integration based on EEG signals.

CAP sequences comprise multiple, consecutive cycles of phasic activation (A-phases). Here, we propose a novel, automated system exploiting the dynamical, temporal information in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings for the classification of A-phases and their subtypes. Using recurrent neural networks (RNN), crucial information in the temporal behavior of the EEG is extracted. The automatic classification system is equipped to deal with the biasing issue of imbalanced data sets and uses state-of-the-art signal processing methods to reduce inter-subject variation. To evaluate our system, we applied recordings from the publicly available CAP Sleep Database on Physionet. Our results show that the RNN improved the detection accuracy by 3-5% and the F-1-score by approximately 7% on two data sets compared to a normal feed-forward neural network. Our system achieves a sensitivity of approximately 76-78% and F-1-score between 63-68%, significantly outperforming existing technologies. Moreover, its sensitivity for subtype classification of 60-63% (A1), 42-45% (A2), and 71-74% (A3) indicates superior multi-class classification performance for CAP detection. In conclusion, we have developed a fully automated high performance CAP scoring system that includes A-phase subtype classification. RNN classifiers yield a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity compared to previously proposed systems.

The organization of their sleep differs immensely from adult sleep, and its quick maturation and fundamental changes correspond to the rapid cortical development at this age. Manual sleep classification is specifically challenging in this population given major body movements and frequent shifts between vigilance states; in addition various staging criteria co-exist. In the present study we utilized a machine learning approach and investigated how EEG complexity and sleep stages evolve during the very first weeks of life. We analyzed 42 full-term infants which were recorded twice (at week two and five after birth) with full polysomnography. For sleep classification EEG signal complexity was estimated using multi-scale permutation entropy and fed into a machine learning classifier. Interestingly the baby's brain signal complexity (and spectral power) revealed developmental changes in sleep in the first 5 weeks of life, and were restricted to NREM ("quiet") and REM ("active sleep") states with little to no changes in state wake. Data demonstrate that our classifier performs well over chance (i.e., > 33% for 3-class classification) and reaches almost human scoring accuracy (60% at week-2, 73% at week5). Altogether, these results demonstrate that characteristics of newborn sleep develop rapidly in the first weeks of life and can be efficiently identified by means of machine learning techniques.

Characterization of a patient's cognitive profile is an essential step toward the identification of predictors of cognitive worsening. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the use of the combination of resting-state EEG and data-mining techniques to build characterization models. Methods Dense EEG data from 118 patients with Parkinson's disease, classified into 5 different groups according to the severity of their cognitive impairments, were considered. Spectral power analysis within 7 frequency bands was performed on the EEG signals. The obtained quantitative EEG features of 100 patients were mined using 2 machine-learning algorithms to build and train characterization models, namely, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors models. The models were then blindly tested on data from 18 patients. Results The overall classification accuracies were 84% and 88% for the support vector machines and k-nearest algorithms, respectively. The worst classifications were observed for patients from groups with small sample sizes, corresponding to patients with the severe cognitive deficits. Whereas for the remaining groups for whom an accurate diagnosis was required to plan the future healthcare, the classification was very accurate. Conclusion These results suggest that EEG features computed from a daily clinical practice exploration modality in-that it is nonexpensive, available anywhere, and requires minimal cooperation from the patient-can be used as a screening method to identify the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Two classification models, one which ignores the configuration (model 1) and one that exploits it with different interpolation methods (model 2), are studied. Performance of these two models is examined for analyzing 34 EEG data channels each consisting of five frequency bands and further decomposed with a filter bank. The data are collected from 64 subjects consisting of healthy controls and patients with SAD. Validity of our hypothesis that model 2 will significantly outperform model 1 is borne out in the results, with accuracy 6-7% higher for model 2 for each machine learning algorithm we investigated. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were found to provide much better performance than SVM and kNNs.

Emotion classification finds application in brain-computer interface systems for the assistance of disabled persons. To recognise the emotional state, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal plays a vital role because it provides immediate response to every state of change in the human brain. Here, the utility of tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is explored for the classification of different emotions EEG signals. TQWT decomposes EEG signal into subbands and time-domain features are extracted from subbands. The extracted features are used as an input to extreme learning machine classifier for the classification of happy, fear, sad, and relax emotions. Experimental results of the proposed method show better four emotions classification performance when compared with the other existing methods.

In this work, we directly tested whether spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) signal in prestimulus period could predict perceptual outcome in face pareidolia (visualizing face in noise images) on a trial-by-trial basis using machine learning framework. Participants were presented with only noise images but with the prior information that some faces would be hidden in these images while their electrical brain activities were recorded; participants reported their perceptual decision, face or no-face, on each trial. Using features based on the Regularized Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) in a machine learning classifier, we demonstrated that prestimulus brain activities could discriminate face and no-face perception with an accuracy of 73.15%. The channels corresponding to the maximal coefficients of spatial pattern vectors may be the channels most correlated with the task-specific sources, i.e., frontal and parieto-occipital regions activate for 'face' and 'no-face' imagery class, respectively. These findings suggest a mechanism of how prior expectations in the prestimulus period may affect post-stimulus decision-making.

It has been used in the applications ranging from controlling mobile robots to analyzing sleep stages. Previously it was used in the applications of clinical neurology such as detecting epileptic seizure, finding epileptiform discharges, diagnosis of epilepsy, etc. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the other hand is one of the most popular and successful method that has been broadly utilized in machine learning problems such as pattern recognition, image classification and object detection. The proposed study focuses on maximizing the classification performance by combining two of the most successful methods: CSP (Common Spatial Patterns) and CNN. Three different setups have been established in order to observe the changes in the validation accuracy of the classifier. At first, a CNN (four convolution layers and a fully connected layer) structure is trained by feeding the raw data. Secondly, five different filters are applied to the original signal and their outputs are utilized in the training of a CNN having the same structure. Thirdly, the original signal has been transformed via CSP into another space where its spatial features are observed more clearly and then classified by the CNN. It is observed that the combination of CSP and CNN gives the best performance with 93.75% validation accuracy.

Compared with single modal emotion recognition, the multimodal paradigm introduces complementary information for emotion recognition. Hence, in this work, we presented a decision level fusion framework for detecting emotions continuously by fusing the Electroencephalography (EEG) and facial expressions. Three types of movie clips (positive, negative, and neutral) were utilized to elicit specific emotions of subjects, the EEG and facial expression signals were recorded simultaneously. The power spectrum density (PSD) features of EEG were extracted by time-frequency analysis, and then EEG features were selected for regression. For the facial expression, the facial geometric features were calculated by facial landmark localization. Long short-term memory networks (LSTM) were utilized to accomplish the decision level fusion and captured temporal dynamics of emotions. The results have shown that the proposed method achieved outstanding performance for continuous emotion recognition, and it yields 0.625 0.029 of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). From the results, the fusion of two modalities outperformed EEG and facial expression separately. Furthermore, different numbers of time-steps of LSTM was applied to analyze the temporal dynamic capturing.

Differentiating responders and non-responders to rTMS treatment for depression after one week using resting EEG connectivity measures	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Treatment resistant depression; Electroencephalography; Theta; Alpha	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTIDEPRESSANT RESPONSE; ALPHA ASYMMETRY; THETA CORDANCE; MEDICATION; PREDICTOR; DISORDER; SYNCHRONIZATION; METAANALYSIS	Background: Non-response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment for depression is costly for both patients and clinics. Simple and cheap methods to predict response would reduce this burden. Resting EEG measures differentiate responders from non-responders, so may have utility for response prediction. Methods: Fifty patients with treatment resistant depression and 21 controls had resting electroencephalography (EEG) recorded at baseline (BL). Patients underwent 5-8 weeks of rTMS treatment, with EEG recordings repeated at week 1 (W1). Forty-two participants had valid BL and W1 EEG data, and 12 were responders. Responders and non-responders were compared at BL and W1 in measures of theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) power and connectivity, frontal theta cordance and alpha peak frequency. Control group comparisons were made for measures that differed between responders and non-responders. A machine learning algorithm assessed the potential to differentiate responders from non-responders using EEG measures in combination with change in depression scores from BL to W1. Results: Responders showed elevated theta connectivity across BL and W1. No other EEG measures differed between groups. Responders could be distinguished from non-responders with a mean sensitivity of 0.84 (p=0.001) and specificity of 0.89 (p=0.002) using cross-validated machine learning classification on the combination of all EEG and mood measures. Limitations: The low response rate limited our sample size to only 12 responders. Conclusion: Resting theta connectivity at BL and W1 differ between responders and non-responders, and show potential for predicting response to rTMS treatment for depression.	[Bailey, N. W.; Hoy, K.

We developed an EEG-based real-time cursor control system on LabVIEW platform. EEG signals of left or right motor imagery on C3, and C4 channels were collected using OpenBCI amplifier system. The experimental protocol consisted of a training stage and a self-controlled stage with several runs in each stage. In the training stage, EEG signals were collected while subjects were asked to look at the moving cursor with a constant speed toward left/right, and pretended the cursor was controlled by their imagination. In the self-controlled stage, the movement of the cursor was controlled based on the concordance between the classification results and preset direction. Ten subjects were enrolled in this study. We found that the classification rate was associated with the consistency of the individual ERD/ERS frequency bands across different runs. If a subject presented a stable frequency band for the motor imaginary, the classification rate of the developed BCI system can reach a satisfactory performance with the highest classification rate of 93%. In conclusion, our results showed that the efficacy of our BCI system highly relied on the stability of the individual frequency pattern.

J	Bi, LZ; Zhang, JW; Lian, JL				Bi, Luzheng; Zhang, Jingwei; Lian, Jinling			EEG-Based Adaptive Driver-Vehicle Interface Using Variational Autoencoder and PI-TSVM	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-controlled vehicle; EEG; semi-supervised learning; variational autoencoder; transductive support vector machine	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; P300; HEAD; ADAPTATION; ARTIFACTS; SVM	Event-related potential (ERP)-based driver-vehicle interfaces (DVIs) have been developed to provide a communication channel for people with disabilities to drive a vehicle. However, they require a tedious and time-consuming training procedure to build the decoding model, which can translate EEG signals into commands. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose an adaptive DVI by using a new semi-supervised algorithm. The decoding model of the proposed DVI is first built with a small labeled training set, and then gradually improved by updating the proposed semi-supervised decoding model with new collected unlabeled EEG signals. In our semi-supervised algorithm, independent component analysis (ICA) and Kalman smoother are first used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). After that, variational autoencoder is applied to provide a robust feature representation of EEG signals. Finally, a prior information-based transductive support vector machine (PI-TSVM) classifier is developed to translate these features into commands. Experimental results show that the proposed DVI can significantly reduce the training effort. After a short updating, its performance can be close to that of the supervised DVI requiring a lengthy training procedure. This work is vital for advancing the application of these DVIs.

Conventional electroencephalography systems typically suffer from motion artefacts, extensive preparation time and bulky equipment, while existing electroencephalography classification methods require training on a per-subject or per-session basis. Here, we introduce a fully portable, wireless, flexible scalp electronic system, incorporating a set of dry electrodes and a flexible membrane circuit. Time-domain analysis using convolutional neural networks allows for accurate, real-time classification of steady-state visually evoked potentials in the occipital lobe. Compared to commercial systems, the flexible electronics show the improved performance in detection of evoked potentials due to significant reduction of noise and electromagnetic interference. The two-channel scalp electronic system achieves a high information transfer rate (122.13.53 bits per minute) with six human subjects, allowing for wireless, real-time, universal electroencephalography classification for an electric wheelchair, a motorized vehicle and a keyboard-less presentation. Brain-machine interfaces using steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) show promise in therapeutic applications. With a combination of innovations in flexible and soft electronics and in deep learning approaches to classify potentials from two channels and from any subject, a compact, wireless and universal SSVEP interface is designed. Subjects can operate a wheelchair in real time with eye movements while wearing the new brain-machine interface.

The technology may find application in identifying the target speaker in a cocktail party like scenario and steer speech enhancement algorithms in cochlear implants (CIs). However, the worse spectral resolution and the electrical artifacts introduced by a CI may limit the applicability of this approach to CI users. The goal of this study was to investigate whether selective attention can be decoded in CI users using an around-the-ear EEG system (cEEGrid). The performances of high-density cap EEG recordings and cEEGrid EEG recordings were compared in a selective attention paradigm using an envelope tracking algorithm. Speech from two audio books was presented through insert earphones to NH listeners and via direct audio cable to the CI users. 10 NH listeners and 10 bilateral CI users participated in the study. Participants were instructed to attend to one out of the two concurrent speech streams while data were recorded by a 96-channel scalp EEG and an 18-channel cEEGrid setup simultaneously. Reconstruction performance was evaluated by means of parametric correlations between the reconstructed speech and both, the envelope of the attended and the unattended speech stream. Results confirm the feasibility to decode selective attention by means of single-trial EEG data in NH and CI users using a high-density EEG. All NH listeners and 9 out of 10 CI achieved high decoding accuracies. The cEEGrid was successful in decoding selective attention in 5 out of 10 NH listeners. The same result was obtained for CI users.

Therefore, there is a need for accurate computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems for detecting AD. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the degree to which specific features - including fractals obtained from MRI-based surfaces of the cerebral cortex, cortical thickness, gyrification index and the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS) cognitive test scores - are informative for classifying AD patients and healthy control subjects using several machine learning classifiers. Our results show that a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained with cortical thickness, gyrification index and ADAS cognitive test scores distinguishes between AD and healthy control subjects better than other machine learning methods and other feature combinations. This specific CAD system achieved ideal accuracy and outperformed recently proposed systems. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Watanabe, H; Tanaka, H; Sakti, S; Nakamura, S				Watanabe, Hiroki; Tanaka, Hiroki; Sakti, Sakriani; Nakamura, Satoshi			Neural Oscillation-Based Classification of Japanese Spoken Sentences During Speech Perception	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electroencephalogram (EEG); neural decoding; neural oscillations; phase-locking	BRAIN-WAVE RECOGNITION; PHASE PATTERNS	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used by users to convey their intentions directly with brain signals. For example, a spelling system that uses EEGs allows letters on a display to be selected. In comparison, previous studies have investigated decoding speech information such as syllables, words from single-trial brain signals during speech comprehension, or articulatory imagination. Such decoding realizes speech recognition with a relatively short time-lag and without relying on a display. Previous magnetoencephalogram (MEG) research showed that a template matching method could be used to classify three English sentences by using phase patterns in theta oscillations. This method is based on the synchronization between speech rhythms and neural oscillations during speech processing, that is, theta oscillations synchronized with syllabic rhythms and low-gamma oscillations with phonemic rhythms. The present study aimed to approximate this classification method to a BCI application. To this end, (1) we investigated the performance of the EEG-based classification of three Japanese sentences and (2) evaluated the generalizability of our models to other different users. For the purpose of improving accuracy, (3) we investigated the performances of four classifiers: template matching (baseline), logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest. In addition, (4) we propose using novel features including phase patterns in a higher frequency range. Our proposed features were constructed in order to capture synchronization in a low-gamma band, that is, (i) phases in EEG oscillations in the range of 2-50 Hz from all electrodes used for measuring EEG data (all) and (ii) phases selected on the basis of feature importance (selected). The classification results showed that, except for random forest, most classifiers perform similarly. Our proposed features improved the classification accuracy with statistical significance compared with a baseline feature, which is a phase pattern in neural oscillations in the range of 4-8 Hz from the right hemisphere. The best mean accuracy across folds was 55.9% using template matching trained by all features. We concluded that the use of phase information in a higher frequency band improves the performance of EEG-based sentence classification and that this model is applicable to other different users.

Performance of Extreme Learning Machine Kernels in Classifying EEG Signal Pattern of Dyslexic Children in Writing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; Dyslexia; ELM; Wavelet; Kernel		Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that causes leaners to have difficulties to process letters and number during reading, writing and doing mathematics. Early identification of dyslexic characteristic is crucial so that early intervention given could overcome learner difficulties. A process of writing involves areas in brain learning pathway and motor cortex. This activity could be recorded using electroencephalogram (EEG) non - invasively, Using this information, a study has been conducted to distinguish EEG signal of normal, poor and capable dyslexic children. In this work, EEG signals were recorded from eight channels; C3, C4, P3, P4, FC5, FC6, T7 and T8. The signals were extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with Daubechies wavelet family order 2, 4, 6 and 8 to acquire beta and theta band features. The coefficient of beta band power and the ratio of theta/beta band power were input features of expert learning machine (ELM) classifier. Four types of kernels namely linear, radial basis function (RBF), polynomial and wavelet were applied as output weight in connecting hidden node and the output node of ELM. Parameters were varied to optimize each kernel to obtain the best classification accuracy. Results show that db2 gives the highest classification performance for all kernel among other Daubechies family.

This study develops a new scheme based on Douglas-Peucker algorithm (DP) and principal component analysis (PCA) for extraction of representative and discriminatory information from epileptic EEG data. As the multichannel EEG signals are highly correlated and are in large volumes, the DP algorithm is applied to extract the most representative samples from EEG data. The PCA is utilised to produce uncorrelated variables and to reduce the dimensionality of the DP samples for better recognition. To verify the robustness of the proposed method, four machine learning techniques, random forest classifier (RF), k-nearest neighbour algorithm (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree classifier (DT), are employed on the obtained features. Furthermore, we assess the performance of the proposed methods by comparing it with some recently reported algorithms. The experimental results show that the DP technique effectively extracts the representative samples from EEG signals compressing up to over 47% sample points of EEG signals. The results also indicate that the proposed feature method with the RF classifier achieves the best performance and yields 99.85% of the overall classification accuracy (OCA). The proposed method outperforms the most recently reported methods in terms of OCA in the same epileptic EEG database.

Traditional machine learning methods can only solve the classification and recognition of the same individual within a short period of time, and the classification and recognition effect also depends on the difference of data sets, with strong individual differences. Many classification methods are unstable and have poor universality. Transfer learning can use knowledge from similar data to enhance the learning process, and use knowledge in related fields to help complete the learning tasks in the target field, so as to change the traditional learning from scratch into accumulated learning and improve learning efficiency. In this paper, the power spectrum characteristics of 8 channels signals related to motor imagery at 7-29hz were extracted, and the motor imagery data were classified and modeled by transfer learning algorithm. Meanwhile, compared with the other two existing classification methods PSD (Power Spectral Density) and CSP (Common Spatial Pattern), the analysis results showed that the classification accuracy of transfer learning (90.9 +/- 2.2) was higher than that of traditional PSD+LDA(62.5 +/- 11.6) and CSP+SVM (71.3 +/- 3.5), which verified the feasibility of transfer learning in motor imagery BCI classification and recognition.

MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Speech center; Dominant hemisphere; Machine learning; Convolutional neural network; Classification	LANGUAGE DOMINANCE; HANDEDNESS; ASYMMETRY; CANCER	Each brain hemisphere is dominant for certain functions such as speech. The determination of speech laterality prior to surgery is of paramount importance for accurate risk prediction. In this study, we aimed to determine speech laterality via EEG signals by using noninvasive machine learning techniques. The retrospective study included 67 subjects aged 18-65 years who had no chronic diseases and were diagnosed as healthy based on EEG examination. The subjects comprised 35 right-hand dominant (speech center located in the left hemisphere) and 32 left-hand dominant individuals (speech center located in the right hemisphere). A spectrogram was created for each of the 18 EEG channels by using various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, MobileNet, NasNet, and DenseNet. These architectures were used to extract features from the spectrograms. The extracted features were classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the classification performances of the CNN models were evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC). Of all the CNN models used in the study, VGG16 had a higher AUC value (0.83 +/- 0.05) in the determination of speech laterality compared to all other models. The present study is a pioneer investigation into the determination of speech laterality via EEG signals with machine learning techniques, which, to our knowledge, has never been reported in the literature. Moreover, the classification results obtained in the study are promising and lead the way for subsequent studies though not practically feasible.

Classification of ErrP revolutionized the domain of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), however, due to its poor classification accuracy, it is difficult to use it in practical applications. The use of deep learning techniques such as Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) has been growing because of its end-to-end learning capabilities and classification performance in other fields such as computer vision, speech processing and text synthesis. Very little work has been published towards classification of EEG or its classes using deep learning approaches because of its unexplored benefits in BCI applications. In this paper we propose a novel deep ConvNet architecture to accurately classify Error-related potentials. Using the very recent advances from the field of machine learning, such as hatch normalization and dropout layers, we designed a new deep ConvNet architecture. We evaluate and compare the performance of two proposed deep ConvNets by finding its classification accuracy for EEG recordings from same and cross sessions as well as cross subjects for different trials of individual subjects. We see that the net proposed later with newer layers performs very well by improving the mean performance by tea.

The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology capable of detecting mental states automatically by employing various brain sensing and machine learning methods. This contributes to efforts involving neurological disease management and restoration of cognitive function. In this study, we present an independent decision path fusion (IDPF) method by developing a bimodal asynchronous BCI based on electroencephalographs (EEGs) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to discriminate multiple mental states. The proposed IDPF method generates several independent decision paths, each of which is capable of analyzing cerebral information with respect to a specific aspect, thus interpreting the brain state from multiple points of view. Moreover, in one particular decision path for the fNIRS analysis of the IDPF method, we modified the EEG-based common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm according to the characteristics of fNIRS. The results show that the modified common spatial pattern (MCSP) significantly outperforms CSP in fNIRS-based BCIs. Through validation on an open-access EEG-fNIRS dataset and comparison with recent studies, we found that our IDPF method achieves a high accuracy of 70.32% for a four-class classification problem (left hand motor imagery, right hand motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and resting state).

In order to get the fastest and the most accurate classification performance of multichannel motor imagery EEG patterns, we propose our approach to selection of appropriate type, topology, learning algorithm and other parameters of neural network. We considered linear neural network, multilayer perceptron, radial basis function network (RBFN) and support vector machine. We revealed that appropriate quality of recognition can be obtained by using particular groups of electrodes according to extended international 10-10 system. Besides, pre processing of EEGs by low pass filter can significantly increase the classification performance. We developed mathematical model based on ANN for classification of EEG-patterns corresponding to imaginary or real movements, which demonstrated high efficiency for untrained subjects. Achieved recognition accuracy of movements was up to 90-95% for group of subjects. RBFN demonstrated more accurate classification performance in both cases. Pre filtering of input data using low pass filter significantly increases recognition accuracy on 10-20% in average, and the low pass filter with cutoff frequency 4 Hz shows the best results. It was revealed that using different sets of electrodes placed on different brain areas and consisted of 6-12 channels, one can achieve close to maximal classification accuracy. It is convenient to use electrodes on frontal and temporal lobes for real movements, and several sets containing 6-9 electrodes in case with imagery movements.

However, most previous studies decoded user intention for movement directions based on sensorimotor rhythms during motor imagery. BCI systems based on mapping imagery movement of body parts (e.g., left or right hands) to movement directions Cleft or right directional movement of a machine or cursor) are less intuitive and less convenient due to the complex training procedures. Thus, direct decoding methods for detecting user intention about movement directions are urgently needed. Methods: Here, we describe a novel direct decoding method for user intention about the movement directions using the echo state network and Gaussian readouts. Importantly parameters in the network were optimized using the genetic algorithm method to achieve better decoding performance. We tested the decoding performance of this method with four healthy subjects and an inexpensive wireless EEG system containing 14 channels and then compared the performance outcome with that of a conventional machine teaming method. Results: We showed that this decoding method successfully classified eight directions of intended movement (approximately 95% of an accuracy). Conclusions: We suggest that the echo state network and Gaussian readouts can be a useful decoding method to directly read user intention of movement directions even using an inexpensive and portable EEG system.

The input dataset consists of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals acquired through a commercial wireless headset. The spectral features included mel frequency (MF) components extracted from the low frequency bands of EEG signal. A spatial projection filter was used for the selection of the most relevant features before classification. The popular method of multiclass common spatial pattern (CSP) and regularized CSP (RCSP) are investigated for a subject dependent (intra) and subject independent (inter) generation of spatial projection filter, respectively. Based upon this, present study used two different algorithmic approaches namely MF-CSP and MF-RCSP. The developed algorithm successfully classified four imagery actions with the reported prediction accuracy of 46.23% and 64.01% and standard deviation of 11.60% and 8.67% for MF-CSP and MF-RCSP, respectively.

Deep learning for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification tasks: a review	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						deep learning; electroencephalogram (EEG); classification; convolutional neural networks; deep belief networks; multi-layer perceptron neural networks; stacked auto-encoders	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MOTOR IMAGERY; SLEEP; RECOGNITION; DEPENDENCIES; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; EMOTIONS; SCHEME	Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain-computer interfaces, BCI's), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? Approach. A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. Main results. For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review. Significance. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research.

This human thought translation is a very challenging process as EEG signals contain noise. For noise removal, a bandpass filter or a filter bank is used. However, these techniques also remove useful information from the signal. Furthermore, after feature extraction, there are such features which do not play any significant role in effective classification. Thus, soft computing-based EEG classification followed by extraction and then selection of optimal features can produce better results. In this paper, subband common spatial patterns using sequential backward floating selection is being proposed in order to classify motor-imagery-based EEG signals. The signal is decomposed into subband using a filter bank having overlapped frequency cutoffs. Linear discriminant analysis followed by common spatial pattern is applied to the output of each filter for features extraction. Then, sequential backward floating selection is applied for selection of optimal features to train radial basis function neural networks. Two different datasets have been used for evaluation of results, i.e., Open BCI dataset and EEG signals acquired by Emotiv Epoc. The proposed system shows an overall accuracy of 93.05% and 85.00% for both datasets, respectively. The results show that the proposed optimal feature selection and neural network-based classification approach with overlapped frequency bands is an effective method for EEG classification as compared to previous techniques.

Traditionally, Perceived Stress Score (PSS-14) questionnaire is used to calculate the stress score, which requires manual intervention of people. In this work, we look into the usage of Electroencephalography (EEG) to help predict the stress level of people without manual intervention and recording by a Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) instrument. EEG can estimate and record the electrical signals in brains utilizing sensors exhibited over the scalp. We propose the design of a brain mapping based stress identification system using a single electrode EEG device. Here we have taken EEG recording of 63 students using a single electrode EEG device NeuroSky Mindwave Mobile. A novel feature combination of bandpower ratios of alpha, beta, delta and theta bands are extracted and fed to the classifiers. We evaluate the performance of Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbour machine learning algorithms. Target class of the training set is assigned using the stress score calculated from the response of the PSS-14 questionnaire. We achieve the highest average classification accuracy of 74.43 % using K-NN algorithm. We observe that there exist a correlation of bandpower ratios of different bands obtained from recorded EEG signals from the frontal portion of the brain with the stress level of subjects.

Delayed in receiving medical attention can bring severe consequences. Conventional way of identifying TBI are from the computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, CT scan or MRI is hard to be performed to all patients as there were limited resources in the hospitals. As an early screening for TBI, EEG is a suitable substitution. Yet, it is time consuming for doctors or expert to perform EEG analysis manually for each patient. Therefore, this study suggests a machine learning method to identify moderate TBI patients. In this study, two type of features were analyzed. First is the raw EEG signal of alpha, beta, theta and gamma frequency bands. The second type of features are the power spectral density (PSD) of the respective frequency bands. The extracted features were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) separately to investigate the most informative frequency band features for identification of moderate TBI. From the result, it is found that alpha band features give the best identification accuracy which is at 87.5% for the raw features and 83.33% for the PSD.

Recently, a least-squares-based method has been proposed to identify the attended speaker from single-trial EEG recordings for an acoustic scenario with two competing speakers. This least-squares-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) method aims at decoding auditory attention by reconstructing the attended speech envelope from the EEG recordings using a trained spatio-temporal filter. While the performance of this AAD method has been mainly studied for noiseless and anechoic acoustic conditions, it is important to fully understand its performance in realistic noisy and reverberant acoustic conditions. In this paper, we investigate AAD using EEG recordings for different acoustic conditions (anechoic, reverberant, noisy, and reverberant-noisy). In particular, we investigate the impact of different acoustic conditions for AAD filter training and for decoding. In addition, we investigate the influence on the decoding performance of the different acoustic components (i.e., reverberation, background noise, and interfering speaker) in the reference signals used for decoding and the training signals used for computing the filters. First, we found that for all considered acoustic conditions it is possible to decode auditory attention with a considerably large decoding performance. In particular, even when the acoustic conditions for AAD filter training and for decoding are different, the decoding performance is still comparably large. Second, when using speech signals affected by either reverberation and/or background noise there is no significant difference in decoding performance (p > 0.05) compared to when using clean speech signals as reference signals. In contrast, when using reference signals affected by the interfering speaker, the decoding performance significantly decreases. Third, the experimental results indicate that it is even feasible to use training signals affected by reverberation, background noise and/or the interfering speaker for computing the filters.

MI based BCIs require training, during which the user gradually learns how to control his or her brain activity with the help of feedback. Additionally, machine learning techniques are frequently used to boost BCI performance and to adapt the decoding algorithm to the user's brain. Thus, both the brain and the machine need to adapt in order to improve performance. To study the utility of co-adaptive training in the BCI paradigm and the time scales involved, we investigated the performance of two groups of subjects, in a 4-day MI experiment using EEG recordings. One group (control, n = 9 subjects) performed the BCI task using a fixed classifier based on MI data from day 1. In the second group (experimental, n = 9 subjects), the classifier was regularly adapted based on brain activity patterns during the experiment days. We found that the experimental group showed a significantly larger change in performance following training compared to the control group. Specifically, although the experimental group exhibited a decrease in performance between days, it showed an increase in performance within each day, which compensated for the decrease. The control group showed decreases both within and between days. A correlation analysis in subjects who had a notable improvement in performance following training showed that performance was mainly associated with modulation of power in the a frequency band. To conclude, continuous updating of the classification algorithm improves the performance of subjects in longitudinal BCI training.

The goal of this paper is to utilize EEG to infer the cognitive workload of subjects during intelligence tests. We chose the well established advanced progressive matrices test, an ideal framework because it presents problems at increasing levels of difficulty and has been rigorously validated in past experiments. We train classic machine learning models using basic EEG measures as well as measures of network connectivity and signal complexity. Our findings demonstrate that cognitive load can be well predicted using these features, even for a low number of channels. We show that by creating an individually tuned neural network for each subject, we can improve prediction compared to a generic model and that such models are robust to decreasing the number of available channels as well.

With recent advancements in sensors and computational technologies, brain computer interfacing (BCI) via electroencephalography (EEG) signals have received extensive attention for establishing an alternative form of communication with our brain. In this paper, we propose a subject-specific filtering framework, referred to as the regularized double-band Bayesian (R-B2B) spectral filtering, couples three main feature extraction categories, namely filter-bank solutions, regularized techniques, and optimized Bayesian mechanisms to enhance the classification accuracy by simultaneously taking advantage of the three processing techniques. Furthermore, data collection experiments' are performed to investigate different effects of stimulus on the performance of the proposed R-B2B. In this regard, four different protocols are designed and implemented by introducing visual and voice stimuli. Finally, the paper investigates effects of adaptive trimming of EEG epochs resulting in an adaptive and subject-specific solution. Experimental results show that the proposed R-B2B filter noticeably outperforms its counterparts.

This paper proposes a novel method based on the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) termed the Multiscale and Overlapping FBCSP (MO-FBCSP). We extend the CSP algorithm for multiclass by using the one-versus-one (OvO) strategy. Multiple periods are selected and combined with the overlapping spectrum of the filter bank which contains useful information. This method is evaluated on the benchmark BCI Competition IV dataset 2a with 9 subjects. An average accuracy of 80% was achieved with the random forest (RF) classifier, and the corresponding kappa value was 0.734. Quantitative results have shown that the proposed scheme outperforms the classical FBCSP algorithm by over 12%.

The communication is developed as a result of neural responses generated in the brain because of motor movements or cognitive activities. The means of communication here includes muscular and non-muscular actions. These actions generate brain activities or brain waves that are directed to a hardware device to perform a specific task. BCI initially was developed as the communication device for patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders. Owing to recent advancements in BCI devices-such as passive electrodes, wireless headsets, adaptive software, and decreased costs-it is also being used for developing communication between the general public. The BCI device records brain responses using various invasive and non-invasive acquisition techniques such as electrocorticography (ECoG), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this article, a survey on these techniques has been provided. The brain response needs to be translated using machine learning and pattern recognition methods to control any application. A brief review of various existing feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms applied on data recorded from the brain has been included in this article. A significant comparative analysis of popular existing BCI techniques is presented and possible future directives are provided.

However, practical applications of BCI make it difficult to decode motor imagery-based brain signals for multiclass classification due to their non-stationary nature. In this study, we aim to improve multiclass classification accuracy for motor imagery movement using sub-band common spatial patterns with sequential feature selection (SBCSP-SBFS) method. Filter bank having bandpass filters of different overlapped frequency cutoffs is applied to suppress the noise signals from raw EEG signals. The output of these sub-band filters is sent for feature extraction by applying common spatial pattern (CSP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). As all of the extracted features are not necessary for classification therefore, selection of optimal features is done by passing the extracted features to sequential backward floating selection (SBFS) technique. Three different classifiers were then trained on these optimal features, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), Naive-Bayesian Parzen-Window (NBPW), and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Results are evaluated on two datasets, i.e., Emotiv Epoc and wet gel electrodes for three classes, i.e., right-hand motor imagery, left hand motor imagery, and rest state. The proposed model yields a maximum accuracy of 60.61% in case of Emotiv Epoc headset and 86.50% for wet gel electrodes. The computed accuracy shows an increase of 7% as compared to previously implemented multiclass EEG classification.

EEG-based age-prediction models as stable and heritable indicators of brain maturational level in children and adolescents	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						age prediction; brain age; brain maturation; development; electroencephalography (EEG); machine learning	NETHERLANDS TWIN REGISTER; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; CORTICAL THICKNESS	The human brain shows remarkable development of functional brain activity from childhood to adolescence. Here, we investigated whether electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are suitable for predicting the age of children and adolescents. Moreover, we investigated whether overestimation or underestimation of age was stable over longer time periods, as stable prediction error can be interpreted as reflecting individual brain maturational level. Finally, we established whether the age-prediction error was genetically determined. Then, 3 min eyes-closed resting-state EEG data from the longitudinal EEG studies of Netherlands Twin Register (NTR; n = 836) and Washington University in St. Louis (n = 702) were used at ages 5, 7, 12, 14, 16, and 18. Longitudinal data were available within childhood (5-7 years) and adolescence (16-18 years). We calculated power in 1 Hz wide bins (1-24 Hz). Random forest (RF) regression and relevance vector machine with sixfold cross-validation were applied. The best mean absolute prediction error was obtained with RF (1.22 years). Classification of childhood versus puberty/adolescence reached over 94% accuracy. Prediction errors were moderately to highly stable over periods of 1.5-2.1 years (0.53 < r < 0.74) and signifcantly affected by genetic factors (heritability between 42 and 79%). Our results show that age prediction from low-cost EEG recordings is comparable in accuracy to those obtained with magnetic resonance imaging. Children and adolescents showed stable overestimation or underestimation of their age, which means that some participants have stable brain activity patterns that reflect those of an older or younger age, and could therefore reflect individual brain maturational level. This prediction error is heritable, suggesting that genes underlie maturational level of functional brain activity. We propose that age prediction based on EEG recordings can be used for tracking neurodevelopment in typically developing children, in preterm children, and in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.

User brain response to BCI error is a contributor to non-stationarity of the EEG signal and poses challenges in developing reliable active BCI control. Many passive BCI implementations, on the other hand, have the detection of error-related brain activity as their primary goal. Therefore, reliable detection of this signal is crucial in both active and passive BCIs. In this work, we propose CREST: a novel covariance-based method that uses Riemannian and Euclidean geometry and combines spatial and temporal aspects of the feedback-related brain activity in response to BCI error. We evaluate our proposed method with two datasets: an active BCI for 1-D cursor control using motor imagery and a passive BCI for 2-D cursor control. We show significant improvement across participants in both datasets compared to existing methods.	[Mousavi, M.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [de Sa, V.

On the one hand, users can access information of their health conditions more conveniently; on the other hand, they are exposed to new security risks. In this paper, we presented, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth security analysis on home-use electroencephalography (EEG) IoT devices. Our key contributions are twofold. First, we reverse-engineered the home-use EEG system framework via which we identified the design and implementation flaws. By exploiting these flaws, we developed two sets of novel easy-to-exploit PoC attacks, which consist of four remote attacks and one proximate attack. In a remote attack, an attacker can steal a user's brain wave data through a carefully crafted program while in the proximate attack, the attacker can steal a victim's brain wave data over-the-air without accessing the victim's device on any sense when he is close to the victim. As a result, all the 156 brain-computer interface (BCI) apps in the NeuroSky App store are vulnerable to the proximate attack. We also discovered that all the 31 free apps in the NeuroSky App store are vulnerable to at least one remote attack. Second, we proposed a novel deep learning model of a joint recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) to infer a user's activities based on the reduced-featured EEG data stolen from the home-use EEG IoT devices, and our evaluation over the real-world EEG data indicates that the inference accuracy of the proposed RCNN is can reach 70.55%.

A set of configuration parameters using cross-validation are tested in order to find the ones that reduce the estimation error. We found that selecting properly the number of channels and the time step used to configure the signal, it is possible to improve the filter estimation capabilities. As there was a clear incidence of the variations in the recorded data used to train the model, we studied how those alterations affect the estimation precision. Due to the linearity of the filter, major variations in the velocity and acceleration train filters with lower estimation precision than the ones that are built from more homogeneous data.

The brain activity is classified and translated into a go vs no-go feedback (i.e., mobilizing, or not, the paralyzed limb). Patients performing the same movements but unrelated to their brain activity showed poorer or no recovery, which suggests that an accurate feedback expedites motor recovery. Being able to decode different movements from the EEG would allow providing a more accurate feedback, maximizing the rehabilitative potential. However, a dynamic rehabilitative environment with different types of movements would likely be accompanied by involuntary motions with the eyes and the head, which can contaminate the measured EEG signals. In this study we analyze how external movements associated with the task (i.e., eye or head movements) influence the performance of an EEG-based decoder of reaching movements. Our results reveal that different reaching directions could only be decoded when eye and head movements occur and only using low frequency features (delta band). In summary, this paper highlights the importance of carefully designing protocols to avoid eye and head movements to contaminate EEG signals.

Sensor signals may contain information about the gender and movement of the person. Automatic recognition of physical activities often referred to as human activity recognition (HAR). In this study, a novel feature extraction approach for the HAR system using the mobile sensor signals, the Down Sampling One Dimensional Local Binary Pattern (DS-1D-LBP) method is proposed. Feature extraction from signals is one of the most critical stages of HAR because the success of the HAR system depends on the features extraction. The proposed HAR system consists of two stages. In the first stage, DS-ID-LBP conversion was applied to the sensor signals in order to extract statistical features from the newly formed signals. In the last stage, classification with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was performed using these features. The highest success rate was 96.87 percent in the experimental results according to the different parameters of DS-ID-LBP and ELM. As a result of this study, the novel approach demonstrated that the proposed model performed with a high success rate using mobile sensor signals for the HAR system.

Being able to detect and react to the emotions of the driver would greatly improve in-car safety. It could also be utilized in a variety of different applications to improve the driving experience. In this paper, we introduce a brain signal-operated emotion recognition system that is specifically tailored for the Automotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR) framework. The proposed system acquires brain electroencephalography (EEG) signals of the driver, identifies the underlying emotion using machine learning techniques, and feeds that emotion into the car system where different car components can react to that input. Our results demonstrate the ability of the system to recognize two emotions, namely sadness versus happiness, from the recorded EEG with a mean accuracy of 89.7% across three examined subjects using subject-dependent data. Moreover, when training the system using data recorded from multiple subjects, a mean accuracy of 91.7% is achieved. Taken together, these results indicate the ability of the proposed approach to discriminate between sadness and happiness whose extreme expression could have a significant impact on driving behavior.

This paper proposes a novel feature extraction methodology for separating EEG patterns associated right hand motor imagery performed towards left and right directions. The most discriminative subject-specific feature set is chosen based on Fisher's ratio of absolute phase values of EEG in 6 low frequency sub bands. Using this, the proposed BCI system is capable of providing better classification results than state-of-the-art methodology with fixed channels, fusing absolute phase and spatial features from selected subject-specific discriminative channels. Experimental analysis shows that though parietal lobe is vital in providing distinguishable features, the channel set that provide maximum accuracy, is highly subject-specific. Hence, subject-specific BCI that can decode finer parameters of imagined movement are feasible and further research to understand the activations elicited in parietal lobe can contribute towards robust BCI systems.

Using motor imagery paradigm, one can decode an individual's intention by using their brainwaves to help them interact with their environment without having to make any physical movement. For decades, machine learning models, trained on features extracted from acquired electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been used to decode motor imagery activities. This method has several limitations and constraints especially during feature extraction. Large number of channels on the current EEG devices make them hard to use in real-life as they are bulky, uncomfortable to wear, and takes lot of time in preparation. In this paper, we introduce a technique to perform channel selection using convolutional neural network (CNN) and to decode multiple classes of motor imagery intentions from four participants who are amputees. A CNN model trained on EEG data of 64 channels achieved a mean classification accuracy of 99.7% with five classes. Channel selection based on weights extracted from the trained model has been performed with subsequent models trained on eight selected channels achieved a reasonable accuracy of 91.5%. Training the model in time domain and frequency domain was also compared, different window sizes were experimented to test the possibilities of realtime application. Our method of channel selection was then evaluated on a publicly available motor imagery EEG dataset.

Most of the existing EEG feature extraction approaches are hand-designed with expert knowledge or prior assumptions, which may lead to inferior analytical performances. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven EEG feature extraction method by applying recurrent autoencoders on multivariate EEG signals. We use an Echo State Network (ESN) to encode EEG signals to EEG features, and then decode them to recover the original EEG signals. Therefore, we name our method feature extraction based on echo state network, or simply FE-ESN. We show that the well-known autoregression-based EEG feature extraction can be seen as a simplified variation of our FE-ESN method. We have conducted experiments on real-world EEG data to evaluate the effectiveness of FE-ESN for both classification tasks and clustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FE-ESN over the state-of-the-art methods. This paper not only provides a novel EEG feature extraction method but also opens up a new way towards unsupervised EEG feature design. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This paper presents a novel preprocessing technique to process Electroencephalography (EEG) signals in time domain. The proposed methodology, (Peak Visualization Method) (PVM) is based on selecting peaks with distinctive width and height range in order to perform better classification. PVM uses multiple machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes in order to find the most discriminating ranges. Moreover, selected range peaks are further used to compute features like indices of peaks, prominence of peak, contour heights, relative maxima, relative minima, local maxima and local minima. The extracted features were used as training and test data for a competitive 5-fold cross-validated analysis with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. A publicly available EEG dataset for alcoholic and non-alcoholic classification was used to compare the proposed technique with state of the art EEG-NET deep learning model. In order to visualize the generalized performance of proposed system we use award winning dimensionality reduction technique t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on the features extracted by EEGLSTM and show how our model's activations are classified in alcoholic and non-alcoholic categories. The reduced features are visualized into two dimensions.Features extracted using PVM gives an average accuracy of 90% on 5 folds beating the current state of the art EEG-NET, which manages to achieve an average accuracy of 88% on this dataset.

The patients may use a portable electroencephalography (EEG) device to instruct a computing device via eye movements. We propose the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) EEG devices and pattern classification as a potential solution. In this paper, we investigate simple eye movement recognition using the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) algorithm and compare its suitability and performance against known classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and decision tree (DT). The SAX-based recognition performed better than the three classification algorithms. The SAX-based recognition was also able to achieve higher accuracy with only one single simple feature. These results showed that SAX could be a suitable and efficient technique to perform simple eye movement recognition using EEG signals.

Thomas			Detection of focal epilepsy in brain maps through a novel pattern recognition technique	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Classification; Artificial neural network; Symmetric-weighted scale-invariant local ternary pattern (SWSILTP) technique	NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURES; ICA; ABNORMALITIES; EXTRACTION; SEPARATION; TRANSFORM; ARTIFACTS	Focal epilepsy is a common neurological disorder of the brain. It is symbolized by recurring seizure activities in particular regions of the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain information about the brain activity that can be used to identify areas affected by seizures. For this, however, neurologists have the challenging task to analyze the EEG signal to imply where the source of epilepsy is located. A novel approach to detect regions of focal epilepsy is proposed in this paper. By using an adaptive mixture of independent component analysis as a decomposition algorithm and information about the position of the measuring electrodes, EEG signals are transformed into two-dimensional brain maps that are further altered by a symmetric-weighted scale-invariant local ternary pattern technique. Features from this altered brain map are used as input in a three-layered artificial neural network for classification between epileptic and artifact brain maps. The brain maps classified as artifact are eliminated, and the epileptic components are given as output for doctors to investigate the regions of the brain affected by focal epilepsy. With the proposed methodology, an accuracy of 99.53% to detect epileptic components in EEG signals is reached.	[Dominguez, Eric Ceballos] Tech Univ Dresden, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Subathra, M. S.

An open-access EEG dataset for emotional state analysis is used to classify two dominant emotional models, based on valence and arousal. To calculate the functional connectivity between all available pairs of EEG electrodes four different measures, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, phase-locking value, mutual information, and magnitude square coherence estimation, were used. Three kinds of classifiers were applied to categorize single trials into two emotional states in each emotional model (high/low arousal, high/low valence). This procedure resulted in decoding performance of 68.30% and 60.33% for valence and arousal respectively in test trials which were significantly higher than chance (approximate to 50%, t-test, and significance level of 0.05). The results obtained using a phase-locking value approach were significantly better than previous findings on the same data set. These results illustrate that functional connectivity between distinct neural populations can be considered as a neural coding mechanism for intrinsic emotional states.

In this study, we present the possibility of brain-controlled robot arm system using arm trajectory decoding. To do that, we first constructed the experimental system that can acquire the EEG data for not only movement execution (ME) task but also movement imagery (MI) tasks. Five subjects participated in our experiments and performed four directional reaching tasks (Left, right, forward, and backward) in the 3D plane. For robust arm trajectory decoding, we propose a subject-dependent deep neural network (DNN) architecture. The decoding model applies the principle of bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) network. As a result, we confirmed the decoding performance (r-value: >0.8) for all X-, Y-, and Z-axis across all subjects in the MI as well as ME tasks. These results show the feasibility of the EEG-based intuitive robot arm control system for high-level tasks (e.g., drink water or moving some objects). Also, we confirm that the proposed method has no much decoding performance variations between ME and MI tasks for the offline analysis. Hence, we will demonstrate that the decoding model is capable of robust trajectory decoding even in a real-time environment.

Nowadays, motor imagery (MI) movement based BCI is highly accepted method for. This paper proposes a novel method based on the combined utilization of principal component analysis (PCA), wavelet packet transformation (WPT), and two-stage machine learning algorithm to classify four-class MI EEG signal. This work includes four-class MI events by an imaginary lifting of the left hand, right hand, left foot, and Right Foot. The main challenge of this work is to discriminate the similar lobe EEG signal pattern such as left foot VS left hand. Another critical problem is to identify the MI movements of two different feet because their activation level is very low and show an almost similar pattern. This work firstly uses the PCA to reduce the signal dimensions of the left and right lobe of the brain. Then, WPT is used to extract the feature from the different class EEG signal. Finally, the artificial neural network is trained into two stages - 1st stage identifies the lobe from the signal pattern and the 2nd stage identifies whether the signal is of MI hand or MI foot movement. The proposed method is applied to the 4-class MI movement related EEG signals of 15 participants and found excellent classification accuracy (>74% on average). The outcomes of the proposed method prove its effectiveness in practical BCI implementation.

This paper presents the first non-invasive electroencephalograph (EEG)-based processor for classifying all the sleep stages implemented on hardware. It utilizes a single EEG channel and multi-machine-learning classifiers to form a home-based polysomnography. These multiple one-vs-one binary Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) classifiers are combined to classify all the sleep stages using two features only. To implement the desired features efficiently on hardware, an exponent-eliminate (EE) Split-Radix 256-point FFT is proposed that decreases the area by 60% compared to the conventional design by avoiding the majority of complex floating-point multiplications and divisions. The proposed all sleep stages classification system is implemented using 180nm CMOS process and experimentally verified using FPGA based on the EEG recordings of 197 patients from Physionet Sleep database. It utilizes a miniaturized active area of 0.32mm(2) and achieves a Cohen Kappa score of 0.847 while consuming 0.7 mu J/classification.

This study compared the support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BP-NN) for MI classification. In this study, EEG data of four subjects provided by BCI competition 2008 was employed. For the comparison of classification accuracy (CA), there were three steps. First, EEG feature extraction for MI was implemented by using a common spatial pattern. Second, SVM and BP-NN were used to classify MI by cross-validation. Finally, the CA rate, receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) were given to evaluate two classifiers. The average CA rates obtained on the four subjects using SVM and BP-NN were 75.20 and 80.73%, respectively. Furthermore, the mean AUCs of SVM and BP-NN were 0.7860 and 0.9462, respectively.

The EEG dataset is collected by the Fp1 and Fp2 electrode of a 32-channel EEG system. The result demonstrates that the classification performance based on the EEG of Fp1 location exceeds the performance based on the EEG of Fp2 location, and shows that single-channel EEG analysis can provide discrimination of MDD at the level of multi-channel EEG analysis. Furthermore, a portable EEG device collecting the signal from Fp1 location is used to collect the second dataset. The Classification and Regression Tree combining genetic algorithm (GA) achieves the highest accuracy of 86.67% based on leave-one-participant-out cross validation, which shows that the single-channel EEG-based machine learning method is promising to support MDD prescreening application.

In order to detect epileptic seizures has been used to support vector machine model. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane being based on training data (supervised learning) and the algorithm outputs representing the optimal hyperplane. The adopted approach was to extract features from the data in order to be used to train and test data by using machine learning models in MATLAB. Seizures signals were obtained from EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with intractable seizures and ages 3-22 years.

The robustness of MI-BCI is a major concern in practical applications, and hence various efforts in the literature have been made to enhance the MI classification accuracy from EEG signals. Recently, classifiers based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance. In further exploration of applying CNNs to EEG data, we propose a spatial component-wise convolutional network (SCCNet), featuring an initial convolutional layer for spatial filtering, a common processing in EEG analysis for signal enhancement and noise reduction. Through a series of optimization and validation, we show the superiority of SCCNet in MI EEG classification, outperforming other existing CNNs.

Experiment was conducted to study correlations between EEG frequency bands and subjective perception as well as task performance. Machine learning-based EEG pattern recognition methods as feedback mechanisms were also investigated. Results showed that EEG theta band (4-8 Hz) correlated with subjective perceptions, and EEG alpha band (8-13 Hz) correlated with task performance. These EEG indices could be utilized as more objective metrics in addition to questionnaire and task-based metrics. For the machine learning-based EEG pattern recognition methods, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers can classify mental states under different indoor air quality conditions with high accuracy. In general, the EEG theta and alpha bands as more objective indices and the machine learning-based EEG pattern recognition methods as real-time feedback mechanisms have good potential to improve the human-building interaction.

Neuroimaging markers of global cognition in early Alzheimer's disease: A magnetic resonance imaging-electroencephalography study	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; cognition; electroencephalography; magnetic resonance imaging	MINI-MENTAL-STATE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; EEG SYNCHRONIZATION; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; CORTICAL THICKNESS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; QUANTITATIVE EEG; RESTING-STATE; DEMENTIA	Introduction: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are a promising means to an objectified assessment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individually, however, these modalities tend to lack precision in both AD diagnosis and AD staging. A joint MRI-EEG approach that combines structural with functional information has the potential to overcome these limitations. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study systematically investigated the link between MRI and EEG markers and the global cognitive status in early AD. We hypothesized that the joint modalities would identify cognitive deficits with higher accuracy than the individual modalities. In a cohort of 111 AD patients, we combined MRI measures of cortical thickness and regional brain volume with EEG measures of rhythmic activity, information processing and functional coupling in a generalized multiple regression model. Machine learning classification was used to evaluate the markers' utility in accurately separating the subjects according to their cognitive score. Results: We found that joint measures of temporal volume, cortical thickness, and EEG slowing were well associated with the cognitive status and explained 38.2% of ifs variation. The inclusion of the covariates age, sex, and education considerably improved the model. The joint markers separated the subjects with an accuracy of 84.7%, which was considerably higher than by using individual modalities. Conclusions: These results suggest that including joint MRI-EEG markers may be beneficial in the diagnostic workup, thus allowing for adequate treatment. Further studies in larger populations, with a longitudinal design and validated against functional-metabolic imaging are warranted to confirm the results.	[Waser, Markus; Sorensen, Helge B.

J	Castano-Candamil, S; Meinel, A; Tangermann, M				Castano-Candamil, Sebastian; Meinel, Andreas; Tangermann, Michael			Post-hoc Labeling of Arbitrary M/EEG Recordings for Data-Efficient Evaluation of Neural Decoding Methods	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						neural decoding; M/EEG labeling; data-driven neural decoding; brain computer interfaces; band-power decoding	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ALPHA; MEG	Many cognitive, sensory and motor processes have correlates in oscillatory neural source activity, which is embedded as a subspace in the recorded brain signals. Decoding such processes from noisy magnetoencephalogram/electroencephalogram (M/EEG) signals usually requires data-driven analysis methods. The objective evaluation of such decoding algorithms on experimental raw signals, however, is a challenge: the amount of available M/EEG data typically is limited, labels can be unreliable, and raw signals often are contaminated with artifacts. To overcome some of these problems, simulation frameworks have been introduced which support the development of data-driven decoding algorithms and their benchmarking. For generating artificial brain signals, however, most of the existing frameworks make strong and partially unrealistic assumptions about brain activity. This limits the generalization of results observed in the simulation to real-world scenarios. In the present contribution, we show how to overcome several shortcomings of existing simulation frameworks. We propose a versatile alternative, which allows for an objective evaluation and benchmarking of novel decoding algorithms using real neural signals. It allows to generate comparatively large datasets with labels being deterministically recoverable from the arbitrary M/EEG recordings. A novel idea to generate these labels is central to this framework: we determine a subspace of the true M/EEG recordings and utilize it to derive novel labels. These labels contain realistic information about the oscillatory activity of some underlying neural sources. For two categories of subspace-defining methods, we showcase how such labels can be obtained-either by an exclusively data-driven approach (independent component analysis-ICA), or by a method exploiting additional anatomical constraints (minimum norm estimates-MNE). We term our framework post-hoc labeling of M/EEG recordings. To support the adoption of the framework by practitioners, we have exemplified its use by benchmarking three standard decoding methods-i.e., common spatial patterns (CSP), source power-comodulation (SPoC), and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)-wrt. Varied dataset sizes, label noise, and label variability. Source code and data are made available to the reader for facilitating the application of our post-hoc labeling framework.

Compared with other physiological signals, EEG signals are directly related to human cortical activities with excellent temporal resolution. After the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the analysis and calculation of EEGs has made great progress, leading to a significant boost in performances for content understanding and pattern recognition of brain activities across the areas of both neural science and computer vision. While such an enormous advance has attracted wide range of interests among relevant research communities, EEG-based classification of brain activities evoked by images still demands efforts for further improvement with respect to its accuracy, generalization, and interpretation, yet some characters of human brains have been relatively unexplored. Methods: We propose a region-level stacked bi-directional deep learning framework for EEG-based image classification. Inspired by the hemispheric lateralization of human brains, we propose to extract additional information at regional level to strengthen and emphasize the differences between two hemispheres. The stacked bi-directional long short-term memories are used to capture the dynamic correlations hidden from both the past and the future to the current state in EEG sequences. Results: Extensive experiments are carried out and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Compared with the existing state-of-the-arts, our framework achieves outstanding performances in EEG-based classification of brain activities evoked by images. In addition, we find that the signals of Gamma band are not only useful for achieving good performances for EEG-based image classification, but also play a significant role in capturing relationships between the neural activations and the specific emotional states. Conclusions: Our proposed framework provides an improved solution for the problem that, given an image used to stimulate brain activities, we should be able to identify which class the stimuli image comes from by analyzing the EEG signals. The region-level information is extracted to preserve and emphasize the hemispheric lateralization for neural functions or cognitive processes of human brains. Further, stacked bi-directional LSTMs are used to capture the dynamic correlations hidden in EEG data. Extensive experiments on standard EEG-based image classification dataset validate that our framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-arts under various contexts and experimental setups.

However, a clear understanding of its impact to the underlying brain mechanisms is critical for its effective application. For this, we analyze electroencephalography (EEG) response to TMS subthreshold pulse at the left motor cortex from 6 healthy controls and 6 schizophrenia patients. We use principal component analysis (PCA) along sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised machine learning technique, on brain connectivity data established by sliding window coherence of EEG based source localized data. The source localization was achieved by using the sLORETA algorithm on our EEG data after artifact removal. This, hence, provides high temporal and spatial resolution in the connectivity analysis results, giving advantage over other neuroimaging modalities. PCA aids in establishing the number of common underlying connected subnetworks (say k) across subjects whereas NMF is employed to derive these k spatial and temporal signature subnetwork response to the stimulus. Within these signatures, we studied motor cortical connectivity and found that schizophrenia patients exhibited sensory gating deficits as compared to controls. These findings can act as potential biomarkers to monitor TMS for clinical therapeutic techniques in the future.

J	Oliva, JT; Rosa, JLG				Oliva, Jefferson Tales; Garcia Rosa, Joao Luis			Classification for EEG report generation and epilepsy detection	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy; Signal processing; Machine learning; Multiclass classification; Medical report	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CROSS-CORRELATION; SIGNAL DECOMPOSITION; FEATURES; BISPECTRUM; MULTICLASS; ILAE	An automatic generation of medical report method (AGMedRep) was proposed in order to process electroencephalogram (EEG) segments using machine learning (ML) to generate textual reports for epilepsy detection. This method is applied in two phases: (1) predictive model building, and (2) automatic generation of medical reports. In Phase 1, classifiers are built and evaluated, in which the best predictive model is chosen to perform Phase 2 for report generation. The AGMedRep was applied in a set of 500 EEG segments, 100 for each class, in a total of five classes. In the first phase, 90 signal segments for each class were selected for feature extraction and classifier building. Posteriorly, five different report expression were defined, one for each class. In each EEG segment, all possible combination of cross-correlogram, power spectrum, spectrogram (SG), and bispectrogram (BS) were computed for feature extraction, generating a total of 15 different datasets. Afterwards, ML methods, such as decision tree, 1-nearest-neighbor (1NN), naive Bayes, backpropagation based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) were applied in each dataset considering a multiclass decomposition approach, generating a total of 75 (15 datasets x 5 ML techniques) classifiers. In the evaluation step, it was found that the "SG" 1NN, "SG and BS" MLP, and "SG and BS" SVM reached, statistically, the best performances for signal classification, but a statistical difference was not found among them. In this sense, the "SG" 1NN model was chosen for report generation due to its lower computation cost, and it proved to be one of the most accurate models. In the second phase, the 50 remaining EEG segments were equally distributed, randomly, into ten folders in order to simulate individual EEG exams. Finally, the chosen classifier was computed in each examination to construct textual reports. As a result, the 1NN model reached an average of 84% accuracy in the report generation. Our results suggest that the AGMedRep can be able to assist medical experts in the identification of patterns related to epileptic events in EEG. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging optical neuroimaging technique which is a relatively new modality for BCI systems. As such, the optimal paradigms and classification techniques for the interpretation of fNIRS-BCI systems is an area of active investigation. Presently, most fNIRS BCIs have adopted Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm as the primary classification approach, however other alternative methods may offer increased performance. In order to compare different algorithms, a dataset from a four-class motor imagery-based fNIRS-BCI study was re-analyzed, and we systematically compared the performance of different machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes (NB), LDA, Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multi-layer Perception (MLP). Our findings suggest that the LR classifier slightly outperformed other classifiers, unlike most fNIRS-BCI studies which reported LDA or SVM as the best classifier. The results presented here suggest that an LR classifier could be a potential replacement for LDA classifiers in motor imagery tasks.

Predicting task-general mind-wandering with EEG	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Mind-wandering; Spontaneous thought; Single-trial ERP; EEG; Support vector machine; Sustained attention to response task; Alpha oscillations	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM; THOUGHT; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; FLUCTUATIONS; MECHANISM; NETWORK; STATES; THETA	Mind-wandering refers to the process of thinking task-unrelated thoughts while performing a task. The dynamics of mind-wandering remain elusive because it is difficult to track when someone's mind is wandering based only on behavior. The goal of this study is to develop a machine-learning classifier that can determine someone's mind-wandering state online using electroencephalography (EEG) in a way that generalizes across tasks. In particular, we trained machine-learning models on EEG markers to classify the participants' current state as either mind-wandering or on-task. To be able to examine the task generality of the classifier, two different paradigms were adopted in this study: a sustained attention to response task (SART) and a visual search task. In both tasks, probe questions asking for a self-report of the thoughts at that moment were inserted at random moments, and participants' responses to the probes were used to create labels for the classifier. The 6 trials preceding an off-task response were labeled as mind-wandering, whereas the 6 trials predicting an on-task response were labeled as on-task. The EEG markers used as features for the classifier included single-trial P1, N1, and P3, the power and coherence in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8.5-12 Hz) bands at PO7, Pz, PO8, and Fz. We used a support vector machine as the training algorithm to learn the connection between EEG markers and the current mind-wandering state. We were able to distinguish between on-task and off-task thinking with an accuracy ranging from 0.50 to 0.85. Moreover, the classifiers were task-general: The average accuracy in across-task prediction was 60%, which was above chance level. Among all the extracted EEG markers, alpha power was most predictive of mind-wandering.

By using wavelet-based maximum entropy on the mean (wMEM), task-specific EEG channels are selected to predict right hand and right foot sensorimotor tasks, employing common spatial pattern (CSP) and regularized common spatial pattern (RCSP). EEG from five healthy individuals (Dataset IVa, BCI Competition III) were evaluated by a cross-subject paradigm. Prediction performance was evaluated via a two-layer feed-forward neural network, where the classifier was trained and tested by data from two subjects independently. On average, the overall mean prediction accuracies obtained using all 118 channels are (55.98 +/- 6.53) and (71.20 +/- 5.32) in cases of CSP and RCSP, respectively, which are slightly lower than the accuracies obtained using only the selected channels, i.e., (58.95 +/- 6.90) and (71.41 +/- 6.65), respectively. The highest mean prediction accuracy achieved for a specific subject pair by using selected EEG channels was on average (90.36 +/- 5.59) and outperformed that achieved by using all available channels (86.07 +/- 10.71). Spatially projected cortical sources approximated using wMEM may be useful for capturing inter-subject associative sensorimotor brain dynamics and pave the way toward an enhanced subject-independent BCI.

The proposed approach employs only the EEG channels over specific areas of the brain for classification, and derives distinct feature vectors from each of those channels. This gives us more data to train a classifier, enabling us to use deep learning approaches. Wavelet and temporal domain features are extracted from each channel. The final class label of each test trial is obtained by applying a majority voting on the classification results of the individual channels considered in the trial. This approach is used for classifying all the 11 prompts in the KaraOne dataset of imagined speech. The proposed architecture and the approach of treating the data have resulted in an average classification accuracy of 57.15%, which is an improvement of around 35% over the state-of-the-art results.

Since artifacts share frequencies with brain activity, filtering is insufficient. Blind source separation, mainly through independent component analysis ( ICA), is the gold-standard procedure for the identification of artifacts in multi-dimensional recordings. However, a classification of brain and artifactual independent components ( ICs) is still required. Since ICs exhibit recognizable patterns, classification is usually performed by experts' visual inspection. This procedure is time consuming and prone to errors. Automatic ICs classification has been explored, often through complex ICs features extraction prior to classification. Relying on deep-learning ability of self-extracting the features of interest, we investigated the capabilities of convolutional neural networks ( CNNs) for off-line, automatic artifact identification through ICs without feature selection. Methods: A CNN was applied to spectrum and topography of a large dataset of few thousand samples of ICs obtained from multi-channel EEG and MEG recordings acquired during heterogeneous experimental settings and on different subjects. CNN performances, when applied to EEG, MEG, and combined EEG and MEG ICs, were explored and compared with state-of-the-art feature-based automatic classification. Results: Beyond state-of-the-art automatic classification accuracies were demonstrated through cross validation ( 92.4% EEG, 95.4% MEG, 95.6% EEG+ MEG). Conclusion: High CNN classification performances were achieved through heuristical selection of machinery hyperparameters and through the CNN self-selection of the features of interest. Significance: Considering the large data availability of multi-channel EEG and MEG recordings, CNNs may be suited for classification of ICs of multi-channel brain electrophysiological recordings.

Early diagnosis is crucial for the timely and efficacious treatment of ASD. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Second Edition (ADOS-2) is the current gold standard for diagnosing ASD. In this paper, we analyse the short-term and long-term relationships between ASD and brain activity using Electroencephalography (EEG) readings taken during the administration of ADOS-2. These readings were collected from 8 children diagnosed with ASD, and 9 low risk controls. We derive power spectrums for each electrode through frequency band decomposition and through wavelet transforms relative to a baseline, and generate two sets of training data that captures long-term and short-term trends respectively. We utilize machine learning models to predict the ASD diagnosis and the ADOS-2 scores, which provide an estimate for the presence of such trends. When evaluating short-term dependencies, we obtain a maximum of 56% accuracy of classification through linear models. Non-linear models provide a classification above 92% accuracy, and predicted ADOS-2 scores within an RMSE of 4. We use a CNN model to evaluate the long-term trends, and obtain a classification accuracy of 95%. Our findings have implications for using EEG as a non-invasive bio-marker for ASD with minimal feature manipulation and computational overhead.

The system decodes flexion and extension movements from noninvasive electroencephalographic signals through Kalman filter and uses them to activate a virtual device. A two-degree-of-freedom control scheme drives the model through a decoded path by generating a set of estimated inputs using differential flatness. These inputs are compensated by a feedback loop when decoding errors or external forces actuate the model. The results provide us an insight into the control architecture performance, which is dependent on the decoding precision. These decoding capabilities can be manipulated through a set of parameter configurations, enhancing the path tracking, or decreasing the decoding error according to their values.	[Veslin, E.

The frequency and severity of each occurrence, while difficult to quantify, may impact long term cognitive function and quality of life. Despite the new revelations concerning brain disfunction from head injuries, individuals still feel pressure to remain on the field despite a debilitating injury. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of a system that could be employed on the sidelines or in the locker room to provide an immediate objective mTBI assessment. Methods: Participants consisted of 38 individuals with a recent mTBI and 47 controls with no history of mTBI within the last 5 years. Participants were administered a simple symptom questionnaire, behavioral tests, and resting state EEG was measured using three frontopolar electrodes. An advanced machine learning algorithm called boosting was utilized to classify subjects into either injured or controls using power spectral densities on 1-min of resting EEG and the symptom questionnaire. Results: Results based on leave-one-out cross-validation revealed that the addition of EEG measurements boosted the accuracy to approximately 91 +/- 2% compared to 82 +/- 4% from the symptom questionnaire alone.

Methods: In this sub-study of the "Target Temperature Management for 48 vs. 24 hand Neurologic Outcome after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Randomized Clinical Trial", EEGs of 20-30 min duration were collected 24 h and 48 h after reaching the target temperature of 33 +/- 1 degrees C. We classified EEGs according to two EEG classification models by Westhall et al. ("highly malignant", "malignant" and "benign") and Hofmeijer et al. ("unfavorable", "intermediate" and "favorable"). We tested prognostic ability against 6 months functional outcome using the Cerebral Performance Category score. Results: We recorded EEGs in 120 patients at 24 h and in 44 patients at 48 h. We found no difference in specificities or sensitivities of the two models between the two TTM groups (all p-values >0.19) or in prognostication at 24 h compared to 48 h (all p-values >0.13), except for the presence of EEG reactivity favoring prognostication at 24 h (p < 0.001). Being classified in the "benign" or "favorable" category was strongly associated with good outcome with specificities of 100% (90-100) and 97% (85-100) for the Westhall and Hofmeijer models respectively. Conclusions: We found no difference in the prognostic performance of the two studied EEG classification models during prolonged TTM for 48 h compared to standard duration, nor between EEG classification performed at 24 h versus 48 h after reaching target temperature. The two models performed best in good outcome prediction.

J	Onay, FK; Kose, C				Onay, Funda Kutlu; Kose, Cemal			Assessment of CSP-based two-stage channel selection approach and local transformation-based feature extraction for classification of motor imagery/movement EEG data	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK			English	Article						channel selection; classification; EEG; feature extraction; local transformation; motor imagery	BINARY PATTERNS; SIGNALS	The main idea of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is to facilitate the lives of patients having difficulties to move their muscles due to a disorder of their motor nervous systems but healthy cognitive functions. BCIs are usually electroencephalography (EEG)-based, and the success of the BCIs relies on the precision of signal preprocessing, detection of distinctive features, usage of suitable classifiers and selection of effective channels. In this study, a two-stage channel selection and local transformation-based feature extraction are proposed for the classification of motor imagery/movement tasks. In the first stage of the channel selection, the channels were combined according to the neurophysiological information about brain functions acquired from the literature, then averaged and a single channel was formed. In the second stage, selective channels were specified with the common spatial pattern-linear discriminant analysis (CSP-LDA)based sequential channel removal. After the channel selection phase, the feature extraction was carried out with local transformation-based methods (LTBM): local centroid pattern (LCP), one-dimensional-local gradient pattern (1D-LGP), local neighborhood descriptive pattern (LNDP) and one-dimensional-local ternary pattern (1D-LTP). The distinctions and deficiencies of these methods were compared with other methods in the literature and the classification performances of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and the support vector machines (SVM) were evaluated. As a result, the proposed methods yielded the highest average classification accuracies as 99.34%, 95.95%, 98.66% and 99.90% with the LCP, 1D-LGP, LNDP and 1D-LTP when using k-NN, respectively. The two-stage channel selection and 1D-LTP method showed promising results for recognition of motor tasks. The LTBM will contribute to the development of EEG-based BCIs with the advantages of high classification accuracy, easy implementation and low computational complexity.

Oddball tasks are specific types of experiments in which this nature of the human brain is studied. Detailed mathematical models have been constructed to explain the brain's perception in these tasks. These models consider a subject as an ideal observer who abstracts a hypothesis from the previous stimuli, and estimates its hyper-parameters - in order to make the next prediction. The corresponding prediction error is assumed to manifest the subjective surprise of the brain. While the approach of earlier works to this problem has been to suggest an encoding model, we investigated the reverse model: if the stimuli's surprise is assumed as the cause of the observer's surprise, it must be possible to decode the surprise of each stimulus, for every single subject, given only their neural responses, i.e. to tell how unexpected a specific stimulus has been for them. Employing machine learning tools, we developed a surprise decoding model for binary oddball tasks. We constructed our model using the ideal observer proposed by Meyniel et al. in 2016, and applied it to three datasets, one with visual, one with auditory, and one with both visual and auditory stimuli. We demonstrated that our decoding model performs very well for both of the sensory modalities with or without the presence of the subject's motor response.

A number of features are extracted from an online EEG dataset with 81 subjects, including 32 healthy controls and 49 Schizophrenia patients. The EEG signals are preprocessed and since the dataset is relatively small, the random forest machine learning algorithm is chosen to be applied on different combinations of feature sets for classification. It is found that the classification accuracy can be improved by adding certain features extracted from EEG signals.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven successful as function approximators and have therefore been used for classification problems including electroencephalography (EEG) signal decoding for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Artificial neural networks, however, are considered black boxes, because they usually have thousands of parameters, making interpretation of their internal processes challenging. Here we systematically evaluate the use of CNNs for EEG signal decoding and investigate a method for visualizing the CNN model decision process. Approach. We developed a CNN model to decode the covert focus of attention from EEG event-related potentials during object selection. We compared the CNN and the commonly used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier performance, applied to datasets with different dimensionality, and analyzed transfer learning capacity. Moreover, we validated the impact of single model components by systematically altering the model. Furthermore, we investigated the use of saliency maps as a tool for visualizing the spatial and temporal features driving the model output. Main results. The CNN model and the LDA classifier achieved comparable accuracy on the lower-dimensional dataset, but CNN exceeded LDA performance significantly on the higher-dimensional dataset (without hypothesis-driven preprocessing), achieving an average decoding accuracy of 90.7% (chance level = 8.3%). Parallel convolutions, tanh or ELU activation functions, and dropout regularization proved valuable for model performance, whereas the sequential convolutions, ReLU activation function, and batch normalization components reduced accuracy or yielded no significant difference. Saliency maps revealed meaningful features, displaying the typical spatial distribution and latency of the P300 component expected during this task. Significance. Following systematic evaluation, we provide recommendations for when and how to use CNN models in EEG decoding. Moreover, we propose a new approach for investigating the neural correlates of a cognitive task by training CNN models on raw high-dimensional EEG data and utilizing saliency maps for relevant feature extraction.

Data is recorded by self-written an application, including 11 states: the states related to eye behavior, facial expression, and thinking signals. Feature extraction is an essential step in the process of signal, and the Wavelet transform is used in this phase. The feature matrix is built with components calculated by using the Wavelet method. This paper also gives a piece of information about classical machine learning such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bagged Tree (BT) and modern algorithms as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Learning (DL). There are four main algorithms used to classify signals. The proposed scheme yielded significantly higher classification performances using machine learning classifiers compared to extant quantitative feature extraction. These results suggest the proposed feature extraction method reliably classifies EEG signals recorded during thinking with a higher degree of accuracy.

We consider local CSPs generated from individual channels and their neighbors (termed "local regions") rather than a global CSP generated from all channels. The novelty is to select a few good local regions using interquartile range (IQR) or an "above the mean" rule based on variance ratio dispersion score (VRDS) and inter-class feature distance (ICFD); instead of computationally expensive cross-validationmethod. Furthermore, we develop frequency optimization using filter banks by extending the VRDS and ICFD to frequency-optimized local CSPs. The proposed methods are tested on three publicly available brain-computer interface (BCI) datasets: BCI competition III dataset IVa, BCI competition IV dataset I, and BCI competition IV dataset IIb. The proposedmethod exhibits substantially improved classification accuracy compared to recent related motor imagery (MI) classificationmethods.

Several patients, however, may suffer from postoperative cognitive deterioration. The DBS screening therefore includes an assessment of cognitive functioning prior to DBS surgery. However, these assessments may be influenced by factors such as fatigue or motivation and there is a need for novel biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction to complement the DBS screening. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been previously suggested to identify potential cognitive impairment in PD patients and may have utility during the DBS screening. A limited set of biomarkers (features) from the EEG has been identified for this purpose. Finding new biomarkers is time-consuming and there is no driving hypothesis on which new biomarkers may he important. Based on EEG time series of 40 DBS candidates, this research focuses on automated machine learning techniques to develop EEG-based algorithms for the evaluation of the cognitive function of PD patients. The automated pipeline consists of feature extraction, feature selection, modelling algorithm and optimization. With this approach we extract 794 features from each of the 21 EEG channels which results in a massive feature space. From this feature space the most significant features are selected and used for modelling. The hyperparameters of the model are optimized by a Bayesian technique as part of the automated approach. Aside from the automatically computed features, we also explore the use of features commonly used during clinical evaluation of the EEG, with the result that the model based on automatically computed features achieves a significant higher accuracy (84.0%). The newly identified features are potentially new biomarkers. We used the knowledge gathered from our automated approach to build a hand-crafted model resulting in an accuracy of 91.0%.

Jane			Optimized deep neural network architecture for robust detection of epileptic seizures using EEG signals	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure detection; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Deep learning; LSTM	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; MACHINE	Objective: Automatic detection of epileptic seizures based on deep learning methods received much attention last year. However, the potential of deep neural networks in seizure detection has not been fully exploited in terms of the optimal design of the model architecture and the detection power of the time-series brain data. In this work, a deep neural network architecture is introduced to learn the temporal dependencies in Electroencephalogram (EEG) data for robust detection of epileptic seizures. Methods: A deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is first used to learn the high-level representations of different EEG patterns. Then, a Fully Connected (FC) layer is adopted to extract the most robust EEG features relevant to epileptic seizures. Finally, these features are supplied to a softmax layer to output predicted labels. Results: The results on a benchmark clinical dataset reveal the prevalence of the proposed approach over the baseline techniques; achieving 100% classification accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. Our approach is additionally shown to be robust in noisy and real-life conditions. It maintains high detection performance in the existence of common EEG artifacts (muscle activities and eye movement) as well as background noise. Conclusions: We demonstrate the clinical feasibility of our seizure detection approach achieving superior performance over the cutting-edge techniques in terms of seizure detection performance and robustness. Significance: Our seizure detection approach can contribute to accurate and robust detection of epileptic seizures in ideal and real-life situations.

Automated PSG scoring has the potential to reduce the human labor costs and the variability inherent to this task. Deep learning is a form of machine learning that uses neural networks to recognize data patterns by inspecting many examples rather than by following explicit programming. Methods: A sleep staging classifier trained using deep learning methods scored PSG data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). The training set was composed of 42 560 hours of PSG data from 5213 patients. To capture higher-order data, spectrograms were generated from electroencephalography, electrooculography, and electromyography data and then passed to the neural network. A holdout set of 580 PSGs not included in the training set was used to assess model accuracy and discrimination via weighted F1-score, per-stage accuracy, and Cohen's kappa (K). Results: The optimal neural network model was composed of spectrograms in the input layer feeding into convolutional neural network layers and a long short-term memory layer to achieve a weighted F1-score of 0.87 and K = 0.82. Conclusions: The deep learning sleep stage classifier demonstrates excellent accuracy and agreement with expert sleep stage scoring, outperforming human agreement on sleep staging. It achieves comparable or better F1-scores, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa compared to literature for automated sleep stage scoring of PSG epochs. Accurate automated scoring of other PSG events may eventually allow for fully automated PSG scoring.

Since visual inspection and interpretation of EEG signal are time-consuming and prone to errors, various computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools have been proposed. In this paper, we present a novel automated detection system to distinguish between intracranial EEG time courses with seizures and those that are seizure-free based on complexity measures. Specifically, the features used to characterize the EEG signals are estimates of multiscaling properties over a large spectrum measured by using the generalized Hurst exponent. We tested the capacity of these estimates to correctly classify seizure intervals using a publicly available data set. Using the k-nearest neighbor classifier and testing with tenfold cross validation, we achieved 100% accurate classification. Our proposed CAD system outperformed the existing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our CAD system is not only accurate but also fast and simple to implement. Therefore, it can be used as an expert system to support a decision in clinical applications.

J	Zhou, Y; Xu, T; Li, SQ; Shi, RF				Zhou, Yun; Xu, Tao; Li, Shaoqi; Shi, Ruifeng			Beyond engagement: an EEG-based methodology for assessing user's confusion in an educational game	UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY			English	Article						Educational game; Game-based learning; Electroencephalography (EEG); Assessment; Confusion; Machine learning	AFFECTIVE STATES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; EMOTIONS	Confusion is an emotion, which may occur when the learner is confronting inconsistence between new knowledge and existing cognitive structure, or reasoning for solving the puzzle and problem. Although confusion is not pleasant, it is necessary for the learner to engage in understanding and deep learning. Consequently, confusion assessment has attracted increased interest in e-learning. However, current studies have targeted no further than engagement detection and measurement, while there is lack of studies in investigating cognitive and emotional aspects beyond engagement in the context of game-based learning. To quantify confused states in logic reasoning in game-based learning, we propose an EEG-based methodology for assessing the user's confusion using the OpenBCI device with 8 channels. In the complicated context of game play, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to collect the ground truth of the data in real tasks. To solve this issue, this work leverages cross-task and cross-subject methods to build a classifier, that is, training on the data of one standardized cognitive test paradigm (Raven's test) and testing on the data of real tasks in game play (Sokoban Game). It provides a new possibility to create a classifier based on a small dataset. We also employ the end-to-end algorithm of deep learning in machine learning. Results showed the feasibility of this proposal in the task variation of the classifier, with an accuracy of 91.04%. The proposed EEG-based methodology is suitable to analyze learners' confusion on the long game-play duration and has a good adaption in real tasks.

The activation of neurons in these models is static and continuous-valued. However, a biological neuron processes the information in the form of discrete spikes based on the spike time and the firing rate. Understanding brain activities is vital to understand the mechanisms underlying mental health. Spiking Neural Networks are offering a computational modelling solution to understand complex dynamic brain processes related to mental disorders, including depression. The objective of this research is modeling and visualizing brain activity of people experiencing symptoms of depression using the SNN NeuCube architecture. Resting EEG data was collected from 22 participants and further divided into groups as healthy and mild-depressed. NeuCube models have been developed along with the connections across different brain regions using Synaptic Time Dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule for healthy and depressed individuals. This unsupervised learning revealed some distinguishable patterns in the models related to the frontal, central and parietal areas of the depressed versus the control subjects that suggests potential markers for early depression prediction. Traditional machine learning techniques, including MLP methods have been also employed for classification and prediction tasks on the same data, but with lower accuracy and fewer new information gained.

Simpler interaction of users with these types of interfaces in comparison with other interfaces like BCI systems based on steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) as well as comprehensiveness of motor-imagery-based interfaces are the most important reasons of this popularity. In this paper, we propose to use Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) method for MI-EEG based BCI. In order to obtain more accurate sparse representation of the underlying EEG signal, we used dictionary learning approach instead of deterministic dictionary structures which leads to better classification performance. Therefore, we have used Correlation-Based Least Squares Update (CBLSU) in order to obtain an online dictionary learning scheme which is more suitable for BCI systems in terms of computational complexity. It is demonstrated that the proposed method shows better performance in comparison with the existing methods which more commonly use linear classifiers like LDA and SVM. The mean accuracy of 84.79 (SD = 8.51) is obtained for five subjects of dataset IVa from BCI Competition III database, which shows considerable improvement compared to the existing methods.

Mental Workload Classification via Hierarchical Latent Dictionary Learning: A Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy Study	2019 IEEE EMBS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL & HEALTH INFORMATICS (BHI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)	MAY 19-22, 2019	Univ Illinois Chicago, Chicago, IL	IEEE, IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc, GeorgiaTech, Wallace H Coulter Dept Biomed Engn, Emory Univ, G Tec, Univ Illinois Urbana Champaign, Healthcare Engn Syst Ctr, Starkey Hearing Technologies, AMIA, NSF	Univ Illinois Chicago		EEG	Variations in the brain's blood oxygenation and deoxygenation reflect neuronal activation patterns, and can be measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We aim to utilize fNIRS to obtain insights into the dynamic functional connectivity of the brain as a function of the mental workload. Interpreting connectivity in the brain using noisy fNIRS data with low signal to noise ratio is challenging. To overcome the challenges with fNIRS data, we use a hierarchical latent dictionary learning approach. This approach provides covariance matrices to obtain the dynamic functional connectivity and neuronal activation patterns that change over time. We use features from the dynamic functional connectivity of the brain reflected in fNIRS data collected from the prefrontal cortex to investigate mental workload. In particular, we study three types of mental workload tasks called n-back tasks and perform binary classification for each n-back task compared to the other n-back tasks and rest condition using support vector machines. The results of our binary classification of various n-back tasks compared to the rest condition outperforms binary classification results reported previously.	[Parshi, Srinidhi; Amin, Md.

The present study aims to identify the altered EEG resting-state functional connectivity patterns of depressed patients, which can be used to test the feasibility of distinguishing individuals with depression from healthy controls. In the present study, the phase lag index was employed to construct functional connectivity matrices. An altered Kendall rank correlation coefficient was used to identify the features with high discriminative power, and several classifiers were employed to classify a total of 27 depressed patients and 28 demographically matched healthy volunteers. Permutation tests were used to evaluate classifier performance. The best classification results demonstrate that more than 92% of subjects were correctly classified by binary linear SVM through leave-one-out cross-validation for the full frequency band, and the AUC was 0.98. Our findings suggest that the depression affects brain activity in nearly the whole cortex and that changes in brain oscillation patterns in the delta, theta, and beta frequency bands are more significant than those in the alpha frequency band. The current study sheds new light on the pathological mechanism of depression and suggests that EEG resting-state functional connectivity analysis may identify potentially effective biomarkers for its clinical diagnosis.

J	Seo, J; Laine, TH; Sohn, KA				Seo, Jungryul; Laine, Teemu H.; Sohn, Kyung-Ah			An Exploration of Machine Learning Methods for Robust Boredom Classification Using EEG and GSR Data	SENSORS			English	Article						boredom; machine learning; emotion; EEG; GSR; classification; sensor	STATE BOREDOM; EMOTION	In recent years, affective computing has been actively researched to provide a higher level of emotion-awareness. Numerous studies have been conducted to detect the user's emotions from physiological data. Among a myriad of target emotions, boredom, in particular, has been suggested to cause not only medical issues but also challenges in various facets of daily life. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) together for boredom classification, although these data have potential features for emotion classification. To investigate the combined effect of these features on boredom classification, we collected EEG and GSR data from 28 participants using off-the-shelf sensors. During data acquisition, we used a set of stimuli comprising a video clip designed to elicit boredom and two other video clips of entertaining content. The collected samples were labeled based on the participants' questionnaire-based testimonies on experienced boredom levels. Using the collected data, we initially trained 30 models with 19 machine learning algorithms and selected the top three candidate classifiers. After tuning the hyperparameters, we validated the final models through 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation to increase the robustness of the test results. Our results indicated that a Multilayer Perceptron model performed the best with a mean accuracy of 79.98% (AUC: 0.781). It also revealed the correlation between boredom and the combined features of EEG and GSR. These results can be useful for building accurate affective computing systems and understanding the physiological properties of boredom.

There seems to be a similarly seductive allure for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, leading people to "overtrust" these systems, even when they have just witnessed the system perform poorly. The AI-powered neurotechnologies that have begun to proliferate in recent years, particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), represent a potentially doubly alluring combination. While there is enormous potential benefit in applying AI techniques in neuroscience to "decode" brain activity and associated mental states, these efforts are still in the early stages, and there is a danger in using these unproven technologies prematurely, especially in important, real-world contexts. Yet, such premature use has begun to emerge in several high-stakes settings, including the law, health & wellness, employment, and transportation. In light of the potential seductive allure of these technologies, we need to be vigilant in monitoring their scientific validity and challenging both unsubstantiated claims and misuse, while still actively supporting their continued development and proper use.

The brain has been conceived as a complex network, whose function can be assessed with EEG. Hence, in this research, fourteen subjects participated in the real driving experiments, and a comprehensive EEG-based expert system was designed for detecting driver fatigue. Collected EEG signals were first decomposed into delta-range, theta-range, alpha-range and beta-range by wavelet packet transform (WPT). Unlike other approaches, a multi-channel network construction method based on Phase Lag Index (PLI) was then proposed in this paper. Finally, the functional connectivity between alert state (at the beginning of the drive) and fatigue state (at the end of the drive) in multiple frequency bands were analyzed. The results indicate that functional connectivity of the brain area was significantly different between alert and fatigue states, especially in alpha-range and beta-range. Particularly, the frontal-to-parietal functional connectivity was weakened. Meanwhile, lower clustering coefficient (C) values and higher characteristic path length (L) values were observed in fatigue state in comparison with alert state. Based on this, two new EEG feature selection approaches, C and L in the corresponding sub-frequency range were applied to feature recognition and classification system. Using a support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm, these features were combined to distinguish between alert and fatigue states, achieving an accuracy of 94.4%, precision of 94.3%, sensitivity of 94.6% and false alarm rate of 5.7%. The results suggest that brain network analysis approaches combined with SVM are helpful to alert drivers while being sleepy or even fatigue.

In this work, FC analysis has been performed by incorporating EEG-based graph-theoretic analysis and a machine learning (ML) framework. Brain FC was quantified with synchronization likelihood (SL). Undirected graphs for each channel pair were constructed involving the SL measures. Furthermore, the graph-based features such as minimum spanning tree, distances between nodes, and maximum flow between the graph nodes were computed, termed as EEG data matrix. The matrix was used as input data to the ML framework to classify the study participants. The ML framework was validated with data acquired from 30 AUD patients and an age-matched group of 30 healthy controls. In this study, the classifiers such as SVM (accuracy = 98.7%), Naive Bayes (accuracy = 88.6%), and logistic regression (accuracy = 89%) have shown promising discrimination results. The method was compared with two existing methods that also involve resting-state EEG data. The first method reported a classification accuracy of 91.7% while utilizing the time-based features such as Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), Sample Entropy (SampEn), and four other Higher Order Spectra (HOS) features [1]. The second method reported 95.8% accuracy involving wavelet-based signal energy [2]. Since the study has utilized a small sample size, the generalization could not be possible. The FC-based graph-theoretic analysis in combination with ML methods could be used as an endophenotype for screening AUD patients.

We reduced each trial into a scalar score using Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA). For each individual, class conditional probabilistic distribution of each mental task was estimated using RDA scores of the trials corresponding to that mental task. Similarities between class conditional distributions across individuals were measured using Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bhattacharyya, and Hellinger distances. Classification task was performed using Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We demonstrate that transfer learning can reduce calibration requirements up to %87.5. Moreover, it was found that QDA provides the most significant performance improvement compared to the case when no transfer learning is employed.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 115 cases of patients with refractory TLE was carried out from October 2010 to 2014 based on the classification of pre-operative interictal discharge patterns in EEG and MRI findings. The patients were followed up for 4 years after surgery. The ILAE method was used to assess differences in seizure-free rate among different types of interictal discharge pattern as well as in MRI findings. Results: A total of 115 cases were classified according to interictal discharge patterns in EEG, including normal cases, unilateral anterior discharge, unilateral multi-region discharge, and bilateral discharge. MRI findings were classified into negative results and positive results. Unilateral anterior and bilateral discharges showed statistically significant differences in post-operative seizure-free rates (p < 0.001). MRI-positive cases showed good overall post-operative outcome, irrespective of interictal discharge pattern in the EEG, whereas MRI-negative cases showed good overall prognosis if the interictal discharge pattern in EEG occurred in the unilateral anterior region. Conclusion: If the pre-operative interictal discharge pattern in EEG is confined to the unilateral anterior region, prognosis is good. If there are abnormalities in MRI findings, post-operative prognosis is good, regardless of pre-operative interictal discharge patterns in EEG. Surgical intervention is highly recommended for TLE patients with normal MRI findings and interictal discharge confined to the unilateral anterior region. (C) 2019 S.

J	Choi, SI; Hwang, HJ				Choi, Soo-In; Hwang, Han-Jeong			Effects of Different Re-referencing Methods on Spontaneously Generated Ear-EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); ear-EEG; re-referencing; mental task classification; brain-computer interface (BCI)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; AVERAGE REFERENCE; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS	In recent years, electroencephalography (EEG) measured around the ears, called ear-EEG, has been introduced to develop unobtrusive and ambulatory EEG-based applications. When measuring ear-EEGs, the availability of a reference site is restricted due to the miniaturized device structure, and therefore a reference electrode is generally placed near the recording electrodes. As the electrical brain activity recorded at a reference electrode closely placed to recording electrodes may significantly cancel or influence the brain activity recorded by the recording electrodes, an appropriate re-referencing method is often required to mitigate the impact of the reference brain activity. In this study, therefore, we systematically investigated the impact of different re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs spontaneously generated from endogenous paradigms. To this end, we used two ear-EEG datasets recorded behind both ears while subjects performed an alpha modulation task [eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO)] and two mental tasks [mental arithmetic (MA) and mental singing (MS)]. The measured ear-EEGs were independently re-referenced using five different methods: (i) all-mean, (ii) contralateral-mean, (iii) ipsilateral-mean, (iv) contralateral-bipolar, and (v) ipsilateral-bipolar. We investigated the changes in alpha power during EO and EC tasks, as well as event-related (de) synchronization (ERD/ERS) during MA and MS. To evaluate the effects of re-referencing methods on ear-EEGs, we estimated the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the two ear-EEG datasets, and assessed the classification performance of the two mental tasks (MA vs. MS). Overall patterns of changes in alpha power and ERD/ERS were similar among the five re-referencing methods, but the contralateral-mean method showed statistically higher SNRs than did the other methods for both ear-EEG datasets, except in the contralateral-bipolar method for the two mental tasks. In concordance with the SNR results, classification performance was also statistically higher for the contralateral-mean method than it was for the other re-referencing methods. The results suggest that employing contralateral mean information can be an efficient way to re-reference spontaneously generated ear-EEGs, thereby maximizing the reliability of ear-EEG-based applications in endogenous paradigms.

Nevertheless, such signals are commonly affected by the individual's emotional state. In this work, we examine the use of images as stimulus for acquiring EEG signals and study whether the use of images that evoke similar emotional responses leads to higher identification accuracy compared to images that evoke different emotional responses. Results show that identification accuracy increases when the system is trained with EEG recordings that refer to similar emotional states as the EEG recordings that are used for identification, demonstrating an up to 5.3% increase on identification accuracy compared to when recordings referring to different emotional states are used. Furthermore, this improvement holds independently of the features and classification algorithms employed.

One of the most used brainwaves is the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) which appears for real or imagined motor movement. In general, EEG signals need feature extraction methods and classification algorithms to interpret the raw signals. Deep learning approaches; however, permit the processing of the raw data without any transformation. In this paper, we present a deep learning neural network architecture to classify SMR signals due to its success for some previous works and to visualize the learned features. The architecture is composed of three parts. The first part contains a temporal convolution operation followed by a spatial convolution one. The second part contains recurrent layers. Finally, we use a dense layer to assign the signal to its class. The model is trained with Adam optimizer algorithm. Also, we use various regularization techniques such as dropout to prevent learning problem like overfitting. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, the well known Dataset IIa of the BCI Competition IV is used. As a result, we get equivalent results to those ones of EEGNet.

Using electroencephalography (EEG), we undertook a feasibility study on exploring event-related potential (ERP) patterns of the user's brain responses during haptic interaction within a VE. The interaction was flying a virtual drone along a curved transmission line to detect defects under the stimuli (e.g., force increase and/or vibrotactile cues). We found that there were variations in the peak amplitudes and latencies (as ERP patterns) of the responses at about 200 ms post the onset of the stimuli. The largest negative peak occurred during 200 similar to 400 ms after the onset in all vibration-related blocks. Moreover, the amplitudes and latencies of the peak were differentiable among the vibration-related blocks. These findings imply feasible decoding of the brain responses during haptic interaction within VEs.

The main objective is to build a simple development platform based on a commercially available 14-channel electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) to control a 3D game. The proposed method consists on harvesting, recording and processing of EEG data from an Emotiv Epoc+ headset. Support vector machine (SVM), linear neural network (NN) and decision trees (DT) are used to build machine learning models and arc compared based on statistical measures. The models are trained on two control states: forward and backward, in order to control the character in the game. In the first stage of modeling, each user is built using its own unique model based on the data gathered during user training. Then a more general model is developed to allow plug and play interactions with many users, without the need for retraining. The proposed classifiers are able to sufficiently model brain control for a single user with acceptable errors for the motor action training dataset, but fail to generalize to datasets with multiple users. Feature extraction improves learning of the models like neural network, but decreases the number of learning samples which calls for more datasets to generalize results for multiple users. The 3D game used for control is built on Unity 5 game engine. The traditional navigation controls in the game are mapped to the machine learning model predictions, while the internal Gyroscope is used for panning and rotation.

The study of human brain through a computer-based approach has increased significantly as it aims at the understanding of infants' mind and measures their attention towards the surrounding activities. The artificial neural network achieved a significant level of success in different fields, such as pattern classification, decision making, prediction, and adaptive control by learning from a set of data and construct weight matrices to represent the learning patterns. This research study proposes an artificial neural network based approach to predict the rightward asymmetry or leftward asymmetry which reflects higher frontal functional connectivity in the frontal right and frontal left, respectively within infant's brain. In the traditional methods, the value of asymmetry of the frontal (FA) functional connectivity is used to determine the rightward or the leftward asymmetry while the proposed approach is trying to predict that without going through all the levels of the calculation complexity. The achieved work will supply a deep understanding into the deployment of the functional connectivity to provide information on the interactions between different brain regions.

However, a large amount of training data is needed to build the classification architectures used in motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI), which is time-consuming to generate. To address this issue, transfer learning has gained significant attention in a small sample setting BCI system. The transfer learning methods have shown promising results by leveraging labeled patterns from the source domain to learn robust classifiers for the target domain, which has only a limited number of labeled samples. However, the successful application of such approaches in a motor imagery BCI remains limited. In this paper, we present a novel framework called domain transfer multiple kernel boosting (DTMKB), which extends the DTMKL algorithms by applying boosting techniques for learning kernel-based classifiers with the transfer of multiple kernels. Based on the proposed framework, we examined their empirical performance in comparison to several state-of-theart algorithms on two MI task datasets. DTMKB yields the best performance for all datasets and achieves the best average classification accuracy 87.60%, 76.00%, 74.66%, and 74.13%, respectively. In particular, the proposed framework can be applied successfully in a small sample of EEG motor imagery signals.

First, the production of the sequence has been accomplished by selecting the prominent brain rhythm having the maximum instantaneous power at specific timestamp consecutively throughout the EEG. To this purpose, the reassigned smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (RSPWVD) has been employed. Then, in order to verify the proposed technique and evaluate its performance, a case study of seizure detection has been implemented. As experimental validation, 93 patients from the Karunya database have been investigated. Moreover, to characterize the brain rhythm sequence for seizure detection, two additional indices derived from the power discharge and synchronous behavior have been applied. Results show that the particular rhythm pattern during the seizure is usually one type (either $\delta $ , $\theta $ , or $\alpha$ ) and it is subject-dependent. Hence, by focusing on the changes of such particular rhythm through the two indices, the time-related occurrences of seizures can be determined in detail. Meanwhile, the representative channels for seizure detection can be found by studying the similarity of sequences, which are helpful to reduce the number of applied channels. Finally, the proposed technique provides an accuracy of 98.9, which demonstrates it is competent to detect the appearances of abnormal seizures from the EEG signals reliably. Consequently, the brain rhythm sequencing could open a new way to interpret and characterize the EEG in various applications such as for epileptic patients.

In this paper, an automatic apnea detection scheme is proposed using single lead electroencephalography (EEG) signal to discriminate apnea patients and healthy subjects as well as to deal with the difficult task of classifying apnea and nonapnea events of an apnea patient. A unique multi-band subframe based feature extraction scheme is developed to capture the feature variation pattern within a frame of EEG data, which is shown to exhibit significantly different characteristics in apnea and nonapnea frames. Such within frame feature variation can be better represented by some statistical measures and characteristic probability density functions. It is found that use of Rician model parameters along with some statistical measures can offer very robust feature qualities in terms of standard performance criteria, such as Bhattacharyya distance and geometric separability index. For the purpose of classification, proposed features are used in K Nearest Neighbor classifier. From extensive experimentations and analysis on three different publicly available databases it is found that the proposed method offers superior classification performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

To develop an adaptive system that can accommodate the lack of expertise, the system needs to classify the expertise level. In this paper, we have presented a method to estimate the cognitive activity of the novice and expert user in the 3D modelling environment. The method has the capability of predicting novice and expert users. Normalized Transfer Entropy (NTE) of Electroencephalography (EEG) was used as a connectivity measure to calculate the information flow between the EEG electrodes. Functional brain networks (FBNs) were created from the NTE matrix and graph theory was used to analyze the complex network. The results from graph theory-based measures showed that there were significant differences between novice and expert user's information flow patterns. The results showed that a classification accuracy of above 90% was achieved with a simple k-NN classifier and 5 features. From the feature selection method, we found that the most important EEG electrodes that contribute maximum towards classification were the frontal lobe electrodes. The classification results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the novice and expert users in real-time.

However, BCIs based on conventional methods are not highly accurate and reliable, different brain activity patterns are not optimal for all the users of BCIs and has low information transfer rate. Several studies have shown that the combination of different brain signal acquisition methods can lead to higher performance of BCIs. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether the performance of BCI increases if we combine Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) simultaneously for classifying Motor Imagery (MI) tasks of right- versus left-hand grasping movement. The results show enhancement in classification accuracy using a multimodal approach of an EEG + fNIRS BCI with an average increase of approximately 8-10% compared to only EEG-based BCI. This indicates that the hybrid approach in Brain-Computer Interface is capable of enhancing the BCI performance.

In this study, epileptic seizure prediction study on EEG signals is performed by using AR model coefficients and machine learning techniques in order to estimate the epileptic seizure. For this purpose, AR model coefficients are extracted from the EEG signals and used as features. Then, these features are applied to three different classifiers and the performance results are obtained. Experiments are conducted on the American Epilepsy Society dataset.

However, EEG is susceptible to a large amount of noise, especially from muscle activity, making it difficult to use in ubiquitous computing environments where mobility and physicality are important features. In this work, we present a novel multimodal approach for classifying the P300 event related potential (ERP) component by coupling EEG signals with nonscalp electrodes (NSE) that measure ocular and muscle artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new dataset where the P300 signal was evoked with participants on a stationary bike under three conditions of physical activity: rest, low-intensity, and high-intensity exercise. We show that intensity of physical activity impacts the performance of both our proposed model and existing state-of-the-art models. After incorporating signals from nonscalp electrodes our proposed model performs significantly better for the physical activity conditions. Our results suggest that the incorporation of additional modalities related to eye-movements and muscle activity may improve the efficacy of mobile EEG-based BCI systems, creating the potential for ubiquitous BCI.

In this paper we set out to quantify what, if any, advantages do physiological sensing techniques provide for the design of learning technologies. We conducted a lab study with 251 game sessions and 17 users focusing on skill development (i.e., user's ability to master complex tasks). We collected click-stream data, as well as eye-tracking, electroencephalography (EEG), video, and wristband data during the experiment. Our analysis shows that traditional click-stream models achieve 39% error rate in predicting learning performance (and 18% when we perform feature selection), while for fused multimodal the error drops up to 6%. Our work highlights the limitations of standalone click-stream models, and quantifies the expected benefits of using a variety of multimodal data coming from physiological sensing. Our findings help shape the future of learning technology research by pointing out the substantial benefits of physiological sensing.

BCI allows users to control computers or other devices using brain waves. The process of identifying patterns of brain activity depends on the classification algorithm. A portable BCI system classifiers need the ability to identify patterns obtained from electroencephalogram (EEG) channels. In this research, a reliable classification system was built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm that are suitable for recognizing brain wave patterns. The SVM algorithm was implemented to identify five activity patterns from 4-channel EEG when performing different motor movements. The results show that SVM performance is reliable in recognizing and distinguishing those patterns based on the EEG's gamma waves.

Automated behavioral state classification in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings may be beneficial for iEEG interpretation and quantifying sleep patterns to enable behavioral state dependent neuromodulation therapy in next generation implantable brain stimulation devices. Here, we introduce a fully automated unsupervised framework to differentiate between awake (AW), sleep (N2), and slow wave sleep (N3) using intracranial EEG (iEEG) only and validated with expert scored polysomnography. Approach. Data from eight patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery (age 40 +/- 11, three female) with intracranial depth electrodes for iEEG monitoring were included. Spectral power features (0.1-235 Hz) spanning several frequency bands from a single electrode were used to classify behavioral states of patients into AW, N2, and N3. Main results. Overall, classification accuracy of 94%, with 94% sensitivity and 93% specificity across eight subjects using multiple spectral power features from a single electrode was achieved. Classification performance of N3 sleep was significantly better (95%, sensitivity 95%, specificity 93%) than that of the N2 sleep phase (87%, sensitivity 78%, specificity 96%). Significance. Automated, unsupervised, and robust classification of behavioral states based on iEEG data is possible, and it is feasible to incorporate these algorithms into future implantable devices with limited computational power, memory, and number of electrodes for brain monitoring and stimulation.

In this study, a transfer-learning-based support vector machine (TrSVM) method is proposed for epileptic electroencephalogram recognition. The proposed transfer SVM model aims to significantly improve the recognition performance using the transductive transfer learning mechanism. In this study, we mainly integrate a large-margin-projected mechanism into a classical SVM model, which can be utilized to resist the loss of performances caused by the differences between data distributions.

J	Xie, ZL; Reetzke, R; Chandrasekaran, B				Xie, Zilong; Reetzke, Rachel; Chandrasekaran, Bharath			Machine Learning Approaches to Analyze Speech-Evoked Neurophysiological Responses	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article							FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING RESPONSES; HUMAN BRAIN-STEM; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; AUDITORY RESPONSES; NEURAL RESPONSES; ATTENDED SPEECH; COCKTAIL PARTY; EEG	Purpose: Speech-evoked neurophysiological responses are often collected to answer clinically and theoretically driven questions concerning speech and language processing. Here, we highlight the practical application of machine learning (ML)-based approaches to analyzing speech-evoked neurophysiological responses. Method: Two categories of ML-based approaches are introduced: decoding models, which generate a speech stimulus output using the features from the neurophysiological responses, and encoding models, which use speech stimulus features to predict neurophysiological responses. In this review, we focus on (a) a decoding model classification approach, wherein speech-evoked neurophysiological responses are classified as belonging to 1 of a finite set of possible speech events (e.g., phonological categories), and (b) an encoding model temporal response function approach, which quantifies the transformation of a speech stimulus feature to continuous neural activity. Results: We illustrate the utility of the classification approach to analyze early electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to Mandarin lexical tone categories from a traditional experimental design, and to classify EEG responses to English phonemes evoked by natural continuous speech (i.e., an audiobook) into phonological categories (plosive, fricative, nasal, and vowel). We also demonstrate the utility of temporal response function to predict EEG responses to natural continuous speech from acoustic features. Neural metrics from the 3 examples all exhibit statistically significant effects at the individual level. Conclusion: We propose that ML-based approaches can complement traditional analysis approaches to analyze neurophysiological responses to speech signals and provide a deeper understanding of natural speech and language processing using ecologically valid paradigms in both typical and clinical populations.

Amygdala and frontal cortex are two main parts of brain which are highly responsible for cognition and emotion. Now days, human inner feelings reside inside and try to hide its natural response. The human predictive emotion using artificial intelligence, pattern recognition is useful for analyzing neuromarketing behavior. Neuromarketing application area is used to study consumer behavior in order to take review of any product. Earlier, people will collect reviews in groups, surveys etc. Cognitive analysis technique is more beneficial than conventional methods. In this research work, proposed dataset is used to analyse human response while watching advertisement videos. In advertisement videos, emotions of human drive them to purchase and donate money. So, the human response is collected by using EEG device. This response is useful for researchers in neuromarketing, to analyse which product requires improvement or which is in demand. This paper provides accuracy metrics of proposed dataset using deep learning (DL) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. More over deep learning network gives more accurate results than SVM.

The machine learning methods with signal processing algorithms have been used for automated diagnosis of cardiac health using ECG signals. In this article, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coupled with novel 1-dimensional hexadecimal local pattern (1D-HLP) technique are employed for automated detection of arrhythmia detection. The ECG signals of 10 s duration are subjected to DWT to decompose up to five levels. The 1D-HLP extracts 512 dimensional features from each level of the five levels of low pass filter. Then, these extracted features are concatenated to obtain 512 x 6 = 3072 dimensional feature set. These fused features are subjected to neighborhood component analysis (NCA) feature reduction technique to obtain 64, 128 and 256 features. Finally, these features are subjected to 1 nearest neighborhood (1NN) classifier for classification with 4 distance metrics namely city block, Euclidean, spearman and cosine. We have obtained a classification accuracy of 95.0% in classifying 17 arrhythmia classes using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia ECG dataset. Our results show that the proposed method is more superior than other already reported classical ensemble learning and deep learning methods for arrhythmia detection using ECG signals.

Previous studies seeking to understand the neural correlates underlying motor memory consolidation that is modulated by exercise, have relied so far on using traditional statistical approaches for a priori selected features from neuroimaging data, including EEG. With recent advances in machine learning, data-driven techniques such as deep learning have shown great potential for EEG data decoding for brain-computer interfaces, but have not been explored in the context of exercise. Here, we present a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based pipeline for analysis of EEG data to study the brain areas and spectral EEG measures modulated by exercise. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to demonstrate the ability of CNNs to be trained in a limited sample size setting. Our approach revealed discriminative spectral features within a refined frequency band (27-29 Hz) as compared to the wider beta bandwidth (15-30 Hz), which is commonly used in data analyses, as well as corresponding brain regions that were modulated by exercise. These results indicate the presence of finer EEG spectral features that could have been overlooked using conventional hypothesis-driven statistical approaches. Our study thus demonstrates the feasibility of using deep network architectures for neuroimaging analysis, even in small-scale studies, to identify robust brain biomarkers and investigate neuroscience-based questions.

This research topic has received much attention since there is a consensus among experts on the increasing relation between human failure and accidents in safety-critical tasks. MF is one of the most influential aspects leading to human failure and the most reliable way to assess it is using operators physiological data, especially EEG. In the past few decades, hundreds of publications have explored the use of EEG alone or together with other objective and subjective measures for assessing MF, drowsiness, and tiredness in human operators. With recent improvements in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms, the monitoring and mitigation of MF in real time has become a reality. This trend is mainly due to the increasing use of machine learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive look at the current state of the art in the field of MF detection using EEG, identifying the currently used technique, algorithms, and methods and possible trends and promising areas for further research. The paper is concluded by suggesting a kernel partial least squares discrete-output linear regression based model as an all-around good option for an MF assessment system.

The P300 wave is a neural marker of human inhibitory control, and it can be used to recognize the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in human. In addition, the P300 neural marker can be considered as a stop command in the brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies. Therefore, the present study of electroencephalography (EEG) recognizes the mindset of human inhibition by observing the brain dynamics, like P300 wave in the frontal lobe, supplementary motor area, and in the right temporoparietal junction of the brain, all of them have been associated with response inhibition. Our work developed a hierarchical classification model to identify the neural activities of human inhibition. To accomplish this goal phase-locking value (PLV) method was used to select coupled brain regions related to inhibition because this method has demonstrated the best performance of the classification system. The PLVs were used with pattern recognition algorithms to classify a successful-stop versus a failed-stop in left-and right-hand inhibitions. The results demonstrate that quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) yielded an average classification accuracy of 94.44%. These findings implicate the neural activities of human inhibition can be utilized as a stop command in BCI technologies, as well as to identify the symptoms of ADHD patients in clinical research.

J	Tang, XL; Wang, T; Du, YM; Dai, YY				Tang, Xianlun; Wang, Ting; Du, Yiming; Dai, Yuyan			Motor imagery EEG recognition with KNN-based smooth auto-encoder	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						KNN-based smooth auto-encoder; BCI; Motor imagery; Feature extraction; EEG recognition	WAVELET TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; PATTERN; SYSTEM	As new human-computer interaction technology, brain-computer interface has been widely used in various fields of life. The study of EEG signals cannot only improve people's awareness of the brain, but also establish new ways for the brain to communicate with the outside world. This paper takes the motion imaging EEG signal as the research object and proposes an innovative semi-supervised model called KNN-based smooth auto-encoder (k-SAE). K-SAE looks for the nearest neighbor values of the samples to construct a new input and learns the robust features representation by reconstructing this new input instead of the original input, which is different from the traditional automatic encoder (AE), The Gaussian filter is selected as the convolution kernel function in k-SAE to smooth the noise in the feature. Besides, the data information and spatial position of the feature map are recorded by max-pooling and unpooling, that help to prevent loss of important information. The method is applied to two data sets for feature extraction and classification experiments of motor imaging EEG signals. The experimental results show that k-SAE achieves good recognition accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art recognition algorithms.

Cross-Correlation Aided Ensemble of Classifiers for BCI Oriented EEG Study	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); cross-correlation; EEG classification; ensemble	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY; COMPETITION 2003; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; DISCRIMINATION; INFORMATION; FEATURES	Recently, Brain-computer interface (BCI) oriented electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have received due attention for decoding human brain signals corresponding to a specific mental state and providing an alternate solution to the disabled or paralyzed persons for communicating with the computer, robotic arm, or various neural prostheses. In this paper, we propose a two-phase approach to distinguish EEG signals of different mental tasks. The first phase combines the cross-correlation features and slow cortical potentials mean extracted from the most significant channels to form feature vectors. The second phase performs a classification of these feature vectors using SVM and KNN classifiers. It further boosts the classification performance by creating an ensemble of SVM classifiers trained with complementary feature sets extracted during the first phase. EEG signals generated for the same mental task are similar in shape to each other and dissimilar to other activities. The basic principle of cross-correlation is to measure the similarity in shape between two signals which makes it suitable for the EEG analysis. We test the performance of the proposed approach on the BCI competition II dataset Ia representing the cursor movement EEG data for a healthy subject. Experimental results on this dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in the classification accuracy compared to other reported results. Moreover, the proposed work requires fewer channels and features compared to the recent study, which uses all six channels and 42 features, manifesting the efficacy of the proposed work.

Brandon			Quantitative EEG reactivity and machine learning for prognostication in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG reactivity; Quantitative EEG; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Cardiac arrest; Machine learning	TARGETED TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT; COMATOSE PATIENTS; CARDIAC-ARREST; HYPOTHERMIA; PAIN	Objective: Electroencephalogram (EEG) reactivity is a robust predictor of neurological recovery after cardiac arrest, however interrater-agreement among electroencephalographers is limited. We sought to evaluate the performance of machine learning methods using EEG reactivity data to predict good long-term outcomes in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and EEG data of comatose cardiac arrest subjects. Electroencephalogram reactivity was tested within 72 h from cardiac arrest using sound and pain stimuli. A Quantitative EEG (QEEG) reactivity method evaluated changes in QEEG features (EEG spectra, entropy, and frequency features) during the 10 s before and after each stimulation. Good outcome was defined as Cerebral Performance Category of 1-2 at six months. Performance of a random forest classifier was compared against a penalized general linear model (GLM) and expert electroencephalographer review. Results: Fifty subjects were included and sixteen (32%) had good outcome. Both QEEG reactivity methods had comparable performance to expert EEG reactivity assessment for good outcome prediction (mean AUC 0.8 for random forest vs. 0.69 for GLM vs. 0.69 for expert review, respectively; p non-significant). Conclusions: Machine-learning models utilizing quantitative EEG reactivity data can predict long-term outcome after cardiac arrest. Significance: A quantitative approach to EEG reactivity assessment may support prognostication in cardiac arrest. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

IMPLEMENTATION OF EEG SIGNAL PROCESSING AND DECODING FOR TWO-CLASS MOTOR IMAGERY DATA	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-APPLICATIONS BASIS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Brain-computer-interface; Support vector machine; Common spatial pattern CSP; Optimal channel selection	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT	This work decodes two-class motor imagery (MI) based on four main processing steps: (i) Raw electroencephalographic (EEG) signal is decomposed to single trials and spatial filters are estimated for each trial by common spatial filtering (CSP) method; (ii) features are extracted by taking the log transformation (normal distribution) of the spatially filtered EEG signal; (iii) optimal channel selection algorithm is proposed to reduce the number of EEG channels, such approach is regarded as key technological advantage in the implementation of brain-computer interface (BCI) to reduce the system processing time; (iv) finally, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to discriminate two classes of left and right hand MI. Two variations of SVM were proposed: polynomial function kernel and radial-based function RBF kernel. The results revealed that CSP succeeded in removing the strong correlation bound between the EEG samples by maximizing the variance of class 2 samples while minimizing the variance of class 1 samples. The channel selection algorithm achieved its goal to reduce the data dimension by selecting two channels out of three having the lowest variance entropies of 0.239 and 0.261 for channel 1 and channel 2, respectively. The features vector was divided into 80% train and 20% test with five-fold cross validation. The classification performance of SVM-polynomial kernel was 87.86% while it is 95.72% for SVM-RBF kernel as average accuracy of five-folds for both. Thus SVM-RBF is superior to SVM-Poly in the proposed framework.

Tools from machine learning, data mining, and neurocomputing have been extensively explored and utilized to accomplish such compelling data analytics tasks. However, for time-series data presenting active dynamic characteristics, many of the state-of-the-art techniques may not perform well in capturing the inherited temporal structures in these data. In this paper, integrating the Koopman operator and linear dynamical systems theory with support vector machines, we develop a novel dynamic data mining framework to construct low-dimensional linear models that approximate the nonlinear flow of high-dimensional time-series data generated by unknown nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework then immediately enables pattern recognition, e.g., classification, of complex time-series data to distinguish their dynamic behaviors by using the trajectories generated by the reduced linear systems. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of this framework through the problems of time-series classification in bioinformatics and healthcare, including cognitive classification and seizure detection with fMRI and EEG data, respectively. The developed Koopman dynamic learning framework then lays a solid foundation for effective dynamic data mining and promises a mathematically justified method for extracting the dynamics and significant temporal structures of nonlinear dynamical systems.

This information can be used to diagnose brain disorders according to different activation patterns found in controls and patients. This acquisition technology can be also used to explore the neural basis of less evident learning disabilities such as Developmental Dyslexia (DD). DD is a specific difficulty in the acquisition of reading skills not related to mental age or inadequate schooling, whose prevalent is estimated between 5% and 12% of the population. In this paper we propose a method to extract discriminative features from EEG signals based on the relationship among the spectral density at each channel. This relationship is computed by means of different correlation measures, inferring connectivity-like markers that are eventually selected and classified by a linear support vector machine. The experiments performed shown AUC values up to 0.7, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed approach for objective DD diagnosis.	[Martinez-Murcia, F.

J	Seo, J; Laine, TH; Sohn, KA				Seo, Jungryul; Laine, Teemu H.; Sohn, Kyung-Ah			Machine learning approaches for boredom classification using EEG	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Boredom; EEG; Machine learning; Classification; Emotion; Sensor	EMOTION RECOGNITION; STATE BOREDOM	Recently, commercial physiological sensors and computing devices have become cheaper and more accessible, while computer systems have become increasingly aware of their contexts, including but not limited to users' emotions. Consequently, many studies on emotion recognition have been conducted. However, boredom has received relatively little attention as a target emotion due to its diverse nature. Moreover, only a few researchers have tried classifying boredom using electroencephalogram (EEG). In this study, to perform this classification, we first reviewed studies that tried classifying emotions using EEG. Further, we designed and executed an experiment, which used a video stimulus to evoke boredom and non-boredom, and collected EEG data from 28 Korean adult participants. After collecting the data, we extracted its absolute band power, normalized absolute band power, differential entropy, differential asymmetry, and rational asymmetry using EEG, and trained these on three machine learning algorithms: support vector machine, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). We validated the performance of each training model with 10-fold cross validation. As a result, we achieved the highest accuracy of 86.73% using k-NN. The findings of this study can be of interest to researchers working on emotion recognition, physiological signal processing, machine learning, and emotion-aware system development.

For method 1, a subject-specific decision tree (SSDT) framework with filter geodesic minimum distance to Riemannian mean (FGMDRM) is designed to identify MI tasks and reduce the classification error in the nonseparable region of FGMDRM. Method 2 includes a feature extraction algorithm and a classification algorithm. The feature extraction algorithm combines semisupervised joint mutual information (semi-JMI) with general discriminate analysis (GDA), namely, SJGDA, to reduce the dimension of vectors in the Riemannian tangent plane. And the classification algorithm replaces the FGMDRM in method 1 with k-nearest neighbor (KNN), named SSDT-KNN. By applying method 2 on BCI competition IV dataset 2a, the kappa value has been improved from 0.57 to 0.607 compared to the winner of dataset 2a. And method 2 also obtains high recognition rate on the other two datasets.

An array of datasets has been generated with the use of diverse emotion-eliciting stimuli and the resulting brainwave responses conventionally captured with high-end EEG devices. However, the applicability of these devices is to some extent limited by practical constraints and may prove difficult to be deployed in highly mobile context omnipresent in everyday happenings. In this study, we evaluate the potential of OpenBCI to bridge this gap by first comparing its performance to research grade EEG system, employing the same algorithms that were applied on benchmark datasets. Moreover, for the purpose of emotion classification, we propose a novel method to facilitate the selection of audio-visual stimuli of high/low valence and arousal. Our setup entailed recruiting 200 healthy volunteers of varying years of age to identify the top 60 affective video clips from a total of 120 candidates through standardized self assessment, genre tags, and unsupervised machine learning. In addition, 43 participants were enrolled to watch the pre-selected clips during which emotional EEG brainwaves and peripheral physiological signals were collected. These recordings were analyzed and extracted features fed into a classification model to predict whether the elicited signals were associated with a high or low level of valence and arousal. As it turned out, our prediction accuracies were decidedly comparable to those of previous studies that utilized more costly EEG amplifiers for data acquisition.

Machine Learning Based EEG Classification by Diagnosis: Approach to EEG Morphological Feature Extraction	APPLICATION OF MATHEMATICS IN TECHNICAL AND NATURAL SCIENCES	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Promoting the Application of Mathematics in Technical and Natural Sciences (AMiTaNS)	JUN 20-25, 2019	Albena, BULGARIA	Euro Amer Consortium Promoting Applicat Math Tech & Nat Sci				A hypothesis that spike morphological features contain information that can be used for epilepsy type detection by machine learning methods is discussed. Investigation of approach to EEG (electroencephalogram) spike morphological feature definition in relation to machine learning based EEG classification by diagnosis is presented in this study. Two approaches of defining EEG spike morphological features are investigated: A) numerically evaluating EEG spike geometric features, e.g., upslope, downslope; B) using 300 ms of spike (without additional features extracted) for classification. Lists of spikes are used for the classification. Before start of the algorithm some basic preprocessing steps are taken: electric utility frequency (50Hz) is removed. The EEG classification by diagnosis algorithm consists of these main steps: 1) EEG spike detection by morphological filter; 2) EEG classification employing spike morphological features (employing discussed approaches) by diagnosis using machine learning based classification algorithms. Various classification algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network based classifier, AdaBoost, decision tree, random forest, extremely randomized tree, etc.) and their quality metrics are considered (e.g., accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, etc.) as well as results of k-fold cross-validation are investigated in this work. EEGs from children (3-17 years old) are classified in this work. The EEGs under classification are patients diagnosed with: I) benign childhood epilepsy, II) structural focal epilepsy. Current results show that best performance (87% +/- 1%) is exhibited by Extremely randomized tree based EEG classifier employing spike upslope and downslope data.	[Misiunas, A. V.

A Hybrid Physiological Approach of Emotional Reaction Detection Using Combined FCM and SVM Classifier	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY					Users' emotional reaction capturing is one of the primary issues for brain computer interface applications. Despite the intuitive feedback provided by the qualitative methods, emotional reactions are expected to be detected and classified quantitatively. Based on the human emotion representation on physiological signal, this paper offers an hybrid approach combining electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial expression together to classify the human emotion. Several advanced signal processing techniques are used to simplify the data and extract the features involving local binary patterns (LBP), Compressed Sensing (CS) and Wavelet Transform (WT). A novel machine learning algorithm, combined Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are implemented to recognise the feature patterns. The result illustrates a stable emotion classification system with 75.64% accuracy. This design can provide fast and precise emotional feedback, which would further improve the communication between human and computer.

Twenty subjects were recruited to participate in the experiment. They were instructed to perform three different actual/imagined hand clenching force tasks (4 kg, 10 kg, and 16 kg) and three different hand clenching speed tasks (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, and 2 Hz). Topographical maps parameters and brain network parameters of EEG were calculated as new features of imagined force and speed of hand clenching, which were classified by three classifiers: linear discrimination analysis, extreme learning machines and support vector machines. Topographical maps parameters were better for recognition of the hand clenching force task, while brain network parameters were better for recognition of the hand clenching speed task. After a combination of five types of features (energy, power spectrum of the autoregressive model, wavelet packet coefficients, topographical maps parameters and brain network parameters), the recognition rate of the hand clenching force task was 97%, and that of the hand clenching speed task was as high as 100%. The brain topographical and the brain network parameters are expected to improve the accuracy of decoding the EEG signal of imagined force and speed of hand clenching. A more efficient brain network may facilitate the recognition of force/speed of hand clenching. Combined features could significantly improve the single-trial recognition rate of imagined forces and speeds of hand clenching. The current study provides a new idea for the imagined force and speed of hand clenching that offers more control intention instructions for BCIs.

Methods The Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium (CCEMRC) multicenter database contains 7716 continuous EEGs (cEEG). Neural networks (NN), elastic net logistic regression (EN), and sparse linear integer model (RiskSLIM) were trained to predict seizures. RiskSLIM was used previously to generate 2HELPS2B model of seizure predictions. Data were divided into training (60% for model fitting) and evaluation (40% for model evaluation) cohorts. Performance was measured using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), mean risk calibration (CAL), and negative predictive value (NPV). A secondary analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) to normalize all EEG recordings to 48 h and use only the first hour of EEG as a "screening EEG" to generate predictions. Results RiskSLIM recreated the 2HELPS2B model. All models had comparable AUC: evaluation cohort (NN: 0.85, EN: 0.84, 2HELPS2B: 0.83) and MCS (NN: 0.82, EN; 0.82, 2HELPS2B: 0.81) and NPV (absence of seizures in the group that the models predicted to be low risk): evaluation cohort (NN: 97%, EN: 97%, 2HELPS2B: 97%) and MCS (NN: 97%, EN: 99%, 2HELPS2B: 97%). 2HELPS2B model was able to identify the largest proportion of low-risk patients. Interpretation For seizure risk stratification of hospitalized patients, the RiskSLIM generated 2HELPS2B model compares favorably to the complex NN and EN generated models. 2HELPS2B is able to accurately and quickly identify low-risk patients with only a 1-h screening EEG.

For each of the subjects, we recollected time-series obtained from sensors of physiological signals such as electrical cerebral activity, heart rate, galvanic skin response, body temperature, among others. From the first four moments (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) of the time-series we trained Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine models that showed to be effective for determining the gender of the subjects, as well as the type of activity they were performing, their learning style and whether they had previous knowledge about the course contents. These results show that the physiological signals contain relevant information about the characteristics of a user of an online learning platform and that this information can be extracted to develop better online learning tools.

DOSED: A deep learning approach to detect multiple sleep micro-events in EEG signal	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Deep learning; Machine learning; EEG; Event detection; Sleep	SPINDLES; CLASSIFICATION; MULTIVARIATE; MECHANISMS	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) monitors brain activity during sleep and is used to identify sleep disorders. In sleep medicine, clinicians interpret raw EEG signals in so-called sleep stages, which are assigned by experts to every 30s window of signal. For diagnosis, they also rely on shorter prototypical micro-architecture events which exhibit variable durations and shapes, such as spindles, K-complexes or arousals. Annotating such events is traditionally performed by a trained sleep expert, making the process time consuming, tedious and subject to inter-scorer variability. To automate this procedure, various methods have been developed, yet these are event-specific and rely on the extraction of hand-crafted features. New method: We propose a novel deep learning architecture called Dreem One Shot Event Detector (DOSED). DOSED jointly predicts locations, durations and types of events in EEG time series. The proposed approach, applied here on sleep related micro-architecture events, is inspired by object detectors developed for computer vision such as YOLO and SSD. It relies on a convolutional neural network that builds a feature representation from raw EEG signals, as well as two modules performing localization and classification respectively. Results and comparison with other methods: The proposed approach is tested on 4 datasets and 3 types of events (spindles, K-complexes, arousals) and compared to the current state-of-the-art detection algorithms. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the versatility of this new approach and improved performance compared to the current state-of-the-art detection methods.

Characterization of Young and Old Adult Brains: An EEG Functional Connectivity Analysis	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						functional connectivity; machine learning; aging; resting-state; electroencephalography	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR NETWORK; ALPHA; GAMMA	Brain connectivity studies have reported that functional networks change with older age. We aim to (1) investigate whether electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used to distinguish between individual functional networks of young and old adults; and (2) identify the functional connections that contribute to this classification. Two eyes-open resting-state EEG recording sessions with 64 electrodes for each of 22 younger adults (19-37 years) and 22 older adults (63-85 years) were conducted. For each session, imaginary coherence matrices in delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands were computed. A range of machine learning classification methods were utilized to distinguish younger and older adult brains. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was 93% accurate in classifying the brains by age group. We report decreased functional connectivity with older age in delta, theta, alpha and gamma bands, and increased connectivity with older age in beta band. Most connections involving frontal, temporal, and parietal electrodes, and more than half of connections involving occipital electrodes, showed decreased connectivity with older age. Slightly less than half of the connections involving central electrodes showed increased connectivity with older age. Functional connections showing decreased strength with older age were not significantly different in electrode-to-electrode distance than those that increased with older age. Most of the connections used by the classifier to distinguish participants by age group belonged to the alpha band. Findings suggest a decrease in connectivity in key networks and frequency bands associated with attention and awareness, and an increase in connectivity of the sensorimotor functional networks with aging during a resting state.

However, due to the characteristics of non-linear, non-stationary and low spatial resolution of EEG signals, traditional machine learning methods still have the disadvantages of low recognition rate and complicated feature extraction operations in EEG-based fatigue detection task. To tackle this problem, a fatigue detection method with transfer learning based on the Electrode-Frequency Distribution Maps (EFDMs) of EEG signals is proposed. A deep convolutional neural network is designed and pre-trained with SEED dataset, and then it is used for fatigue detection with transfer learning strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed convolutional neural network can automatically obtain vigilance related features from EFDMs, and achieve much better recognition results than traditional machine learning methods. Moreover, based on the transfer learning strategy, this model can also be used for other recognition tasks, which is helpful for promoting the application of EEG signals to the driver fatigue detection system.

A dangerous driving style would possibly result in dangerous behaviors. If the driving styles can be recognized by some appropriate classification methods, much attention could be paid to the drivers with dangerous driving styles. The driving style recognition module can be integrated into the advanced driving assistance system (ADAS), which integrates different modules to improve driving automation, safety and comfort, and then the driving safety could be enhanced by pre-warning the drivers or adjusting the vehicle's controlling parameters when the dangerous driving style is detected. In most previous studies, driver's questionnaire data and vehicle's objective driving data were utilized to recognize driving styles. And promising results were obtained. However, these methods were indirect or subjective in driving style evaluation. In this paper a method based on objective driving data and electroencephalography (EEG) data was presented to classify driving styles. A simulated driving system was constructed and the EEG data and the objective driving data were collected synchronously during the simulated driving. The driving style of each participant was classified by clustering the driving data via K-means. Then the EEG data was denoised and the amplitude and the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of four frequency bands were extracted as the EEG features by Fast Fourier transform and Welch. Finally, the EEG features, combined with the classification results of the driving data were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and a leave-one-subject-out cross validation was utilized to evaluate the performance. The SVM classification accuracy was about 80.0%. Conservative drivers showed higher PSDs in the parietal and occipital areas in the alpha and beta bands, aggressive drivers showed higher PSD in the temporal area in the delta and theta bands. These results imply that different driving styles were related with different driving strategies and mental states and suggest the feasibility of driving style recognition from EEG patterns.

Early detection of epileptic seizures can play a critical role in providing timely treatment to patients especially when a patient is in a remote area. This paper uses deep learning framework to detect epilepsy in the Electroencephalography (EEG) signal. The dataset used is publicly available and has a recording of three kinds of EEG signals: pre-ictal, inter-ictal (seizure-free epileptic) and ictal (epileptic with seizure). The proposed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier classifies these three kinds of signals with up to 95% accuracy. For binary classification such as detection of inter-ictal or ictal only, its accuracy increases to 98%. The EEG signal is modelled as wide sense non-stationary random signal. Hurst Exponent and Auto-regressive Moving Average (ARMA) features are extracted from each signal. In this work, two different configurations of LSTM architecture: single-layered memory units and double-layered memory units are also modelled. After standardising the features, double-layered LSTM approach gives the highest accuracy in comparison to previously used Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and proved to be computationally efficient at Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).

However, the only widely accepted method to obtain sleep staging is by visual analysis of polysomnography (PSG), which is expensive and time consuming. Here, we investigate automated sleep scoring based on a low-cost, mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) platform consisting of a lightweight EEG amplifier combined with flex-printed cEEGrid electrodes placed around the ear, which can be implemented as a fully self-applicable sleep system. However, cEEGrid signals have different amplitude characteristics to normal scalp PSG signals, which might be challenging for visual scoring. Therefore, this study evaluates the potential of automatic scoring of cEEGrid signals using a machine learning classifier ("random forests") and compares its performance with manual scoring of standard PSG. In addition, the automatic scoring of cEEGrid signals is compared with manual annotation of the cEEGrid recording and with simultaneous actigraphy. Acceptable recordings were obtained in 15 healthy volunteers (aged 35 +/- 14.3 years) during an extended nocturnal sleep opportunity, which induced disrupted sleep with a large inter-individual variation in sleep parameters. The results demonstrate that machine-learning-based scoring of around-the-ear EEG outperforms actigraphy with respect to sleep onset and total sleep time assessments. The automated scoring outperforms human scoring of cEEGrid by standard criteria. The accuracy of machine-learning-based automated scoring of cEEGrid sleep recordings compared with manual scoring of standard PSG was satisfactory. The findings show that cEEGrid recordings combined with machine-learning-based scoring holds promise for large-scale sleep studies.

Researchers have done conducted studies on EEG-based identification, while few of them discussed the effect of time robustness which is very important for the identification system. In this study, we compared and analyzed the two runs EEG signals of resting-state of eye open/closed (REO/REC). The time intervals between two runs were at least two weeks. Here are 17 participants joined in this study. Each of them took two runs experiment. Each run contains four sessions, each session includes 150 seconds of REO/REC. Spectral and statistical analyses were used to extract feature. Three classifiers, Euclidean distance, SVM, and LDA, were used to get classification accuracies and to compare the performance between features of each run and two runs. The results of two runs PSD values of both REO and REC conditions show that there is a similarity within each subject and a difference between subjects. The classification accuracies of three methods of each run are almost 99%. The classification accuracies using two runs data as training set can also reach up to 97% while using each of two-run data as training set is nearly 80%. Thus, the features of most subjects have cross-time robustness and could be used as identification. This study will have an important role in EEG-based identification system.

Neuroimaging-based biomarkers for pain: state of the field and current directions	PAIN REPORTS			English	Review						Biomarkers; Pain; Neuroimaging; MRI; EEG; MVPA; Machine learning		Chronic pain is an endemic problem involving both peripheral and brain pathophysiology. Although biomarkers have revolutionized many areas of medicine, biomarkers for pain have remained controversial and relatively underdeveloped. With the realization that biomarkers can reveal pain-causing mechanisms of disease in brain circuits and in the periphery, this situation is poised to change. In particular, brain pathophysiology may be diagnosable with human brain imaging, particularly when imaging is combined with machine learning techniques designed to identify predictive measures embedded in complex data sets. In this review, we explicate the need for brain-based biomarkers for pain, some of their potential uses, and some of the most popular machine learning approaches that have been brought to bear. Then, we evaluate the current state of pain biomarkers developed with several commonly used methods, including structural magnetic resonance imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. The field is in the early stages of biomarker development, but these complementary methodologies have already produced some encouraging predictive models that must be tested more extensively across laboratories and clinical populations.

However, as we sense the light we do not only perceive it through our eyes, but our skin as well, as the epidermal contains photosensitive receptors similar to the retina, the opsins. In this study the sensations from the skin were measured through electroencephalography (EEG) to understand its contribution to our experience of light. For this experiment the subjects were blindfolded and placed in a daylight isolated room with artificial light. Here they were exposed to red, green and blue light as well as darkness. Through a temporal spectrum evolution (TSE) and a machine learning algorithm for visualizing highly dimensional data (t-SNE) the color based perception signatures were found to be distinguishable. T-SNE clustered the TSE maps into four separable segments, one for each scenario. Inside each of these clusters unique delta, theta, alpha and beta event related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) biomarkers could be found. These biomarkers could cultivate the idea that when red and blue are sensed through the skin they elicit cortical arousal and awareness, while green promotes calmness and relaxation.

Internal noise in contrast discrimination propagates forwards from early visual cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Contrast discrimination; EEG; MEG; Source space; Pattern classification; Internal noise	RESPONSES; STIMULI; NEURONS; REPRESENTATION; SOFTWARE; DECISION; MASKING; SIGNALS	Human contrast discrimination performance is limited by transduction nonlinearities and variability of the neural representation (noise). Whereas the nonlinearities have been well-characterised, there is less agreement about the specifics of internal noise. Psychophysical models assume that it impacts late in sensory processing, whereas neuroimaging and intracranial electrophysiology studies suggest that the noise is much earlier. We investigated whether perceptually-relevant internal noise arises in early visual areas or later decision making areas. We recorded EEG and MEG during a two-interval-forced-choice contrast discrimination task and used multivariate pattern analysis to decode target/non-target and selected/non-selected intervals from evoked responses. We found that perceptual decisions could be decoded from both EEG and MEG signals, even when the stimuli in both intervals were physically identical. Above-chance decision classification started <100 ms after stimulus onset, suggesting that neural noise affects sensory signals early in the visual pathway. Classification accuracy increased over time, peaking at >500 ms. Applying multivariate analysis to separate anatomically-defined brain regions in MEG source space, we found that occipital regions were informative early on but then information spreads forwards across parietal and frontal regions. This is consistent with neural noise affecting sensory processing at multiple stages of perceptual decision making. We suggest how early sensory noise might be resolved with Birdsall's linearisation, in which a dominant noise source obscures subsequent nonlinearities, to allow the visual system to preserve the wide dynamic range of early areas whilst still benefitting from contrast-invariance at later stages.

Lexico-semantic (LS) classification from Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is one of them, which is an open and few explored research field. The LS depends on the creation of the concepts of each person and its context. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated a universal fingerprint of the LS either the spatial location in the brain, which depends on the variability the brain plasticity and other changes throughout the time. In this study, an analysis of LS from EEG signals was carried out. The Emotiv Epoc+ was used for the EEG acquisition from three participants reading 36 different words. The subjects were characterized throughout two surveys (Becks depression, and emotion test) for establishing their emotional state, depression, and anxiety levels. The signals were processed to demonstrate semantic category and for decoding individual words (4 pairs of words were selected for this study). The methodology was executed as follows: first, the signals were pre-processed, decomposed by sub-bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) and standardized. Then, feature extraction was applied using linear and non-linear statistical measures, and the Discrete Wavelet Transform calculated from EEG signals, generating the feature space termed set-1. Also, the principal component analysis was applied to reduce the dimensionality, generating the feature space termed set-2. Finally, both sets were tested independently by multiple classifiers based on the support vector machine and k- nearest neighbor. These were validated using 10-fold cross-validation achieving results upper to 95% of accuracy which demonstrated the capability of the proposed mechanism for decoding LS from a reduced number of EEG signals acquired using a portable system of acquisition.

However, not many functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) datasets are publicly available. More fNIRS datasets need to be freely accessible in order to facilitate fNIRS studies. Toward this end, we introduce an open-access fNIRS dataset for three-class classification. The concentration changes of oxygenated and reduced hemoglobin were measured, while 30 volunteers repeated each of the three types of overt movements (i.e., left- and right-hand unilateral complex finger-tapping, foot-tapping) for 25 times. The ternary support vector machine (SVM) classification accuracy obtained using leave-one-out cross-validation was estimated at 70.4% +/- 18.4% on average. A total of 21 out of 30 volunteers scored a superior binary SVM classification accuracy (left-hand vs. right-hand finger-tapping) of over 80.0%. We believe that the introduced fNIRS dataset can facilitate future fNIRS studies.

Decoding attentional states for neurofeedback: Mindfulness vs. wandering thoughts	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Magnetoencephalography; Machine learning; Mindfulness	EEG; CLASSIFICATION; EXPERIENCE; NETWORK; MIND; MEG	Neurofeedback requires a direct translation of neuronal brain activity to sensory input given to the user or subject. However, decoding certain states, e.g., mindfulness or wandering thoughts, from ongoing brain activity remains an unresolved problem. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to acquire brain activity during mindfulness meditation and thought-inducing tasks mimicking wandering thoughts. We used a novel real-time feature extraction to decode the mindfulness, i.e., to discriminate it from the thought-inducing tasks. The key methodological novelty of our approach is usage of MEG power spectra and functional connectivity of independent components as features underlying mindfulness states. Performance was measured as the classification accuracy on a separate session but within the same subject. We found that the spectral-and connectivity-based classification approaches allowed discriminating mindfulness and thought-inducing tasks with an accuracy around 60% compared to the 50% chance-level. Both classification approaches showed similar accuracy, although the connectivity approach slightly outperformed the spectral one in a few cases. Detailed analysis showed that the classification coefficients and the associated independent components were highly individual among subjects and a straightforward transfer of the coefficients over subjects provided near chance-level classification accuracy. Thus, discriminating between mindfulness and wandering thoughts seems to be possible, although with limited accuracy, by machine learning, especially on the subject-level. Our hope is that the developed spectral-and connectivity-based decoding methods can be utilized in real-time neurofeedback to decode mindfulness states from ongoing neuronal activity, and hence, provide a basis for improved, individualized mindfulness training.

Systematic comparison between a wireless EEG system with dry electrodes and a wired EEG system with wet electrodes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Wet electrodes; Dry electrodes; Electrophysiology; P3b; Resting state EEG; Single trial classification	UTILITY; MOBILE; BRAIN; P300; MIND	Recent advances in dry electrodes technology have facilitated the recording of EEG in situations not previously possible, thanks to the relatively swift electrode preparation and avoidance of applying gel to subject's hair. However, to become a true alternative, these systems should be compared to state-of-the-art wet EEG systems commonly used in clinical or research applications. In our study, we conducted a systematic comparison of electrodes application speed, subject comfort, and most critically electrophysiological signal quality between the conventional and wired Biosemi EEG system using wet active electrodes and the compact and wireless F1 EEG system consisting of dry passive electrodes. All subjects (n = 27) participated in two recording sessions on separate days, one with the wet EEG system and one with the dry EEG system, in which the session order was counterbalanced across subjects. In each session, we recorded their EEG during separate rest periods with eyes open and closed followed by two versions of a serial visual presentation target detection task. Each task component allows for a neural measure reflecting different characteristics of the data, including spectral power in canonical low frequency bands, event-related potential components (specifically, the P3b), and single trial classification based on machine learning. The performance across the two systems was similar in most measures, including the P3b amplitude and topography, as well as low frequency (theta, alpha, and beta) spectral power at rest. Both EEG systems performed well above chance in the classification analysis, with a marginal advantage of the wet system over the dry. Critically, all aforementioned electrophysiological metrics showed significant positive correlations (r = 0.54-0.89) between the two EEG systems. This multitude of measures provides a comprehensive comparison that captures different aspects of EEG data, including temporal precision, frequency domain as well as multivariate patterns of activity. Taken together, our results indicate that the dry EEG system used in this experiment can effectively record electrophysiological measures commonly used across the research and clinical contexts with comparable quality to the conventional wet EEG system.

When this assumption is violated, the traditional beamforming algorithms often produce distorted target speech and less than optimal noise and interference suppression. Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) and its applications to auditory attention decoding have offered a potential solution for tracking the listeners auditory attention in a multi-talker environment [2-5]. In this paper, we propose a unified model for joint auditory attention decoding and adaptive binaural beamforming, and solve the problem using an iterative optimization approach. The proposed algorithm has two advantages over the existing algorithms. First, the optimization objective aims to balance auditory attention alignment, target speech distortion, noise and interference suppression. Secondly, there is no need to estimate the speech envelope of each talker from the noisy and reverberant mixture which is a very challenging problem in practice. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using a newly recorded EEG database for a multi-talker, noisy and reverberant environment [6]. The evaluation results confirm the benefits of the proposed algorithm.

Traditionally neurologists used to manually check the EEG signals in order to detect epileptic seizures. However, with the advent of machine learning various scientist have suggested computer-aided machine learning techniques for epilepsy detection. In order to detect epilepsy using machine learning classifiers, researchers extract features from EEG data. These features are then fed to ML classifiers for detecting epilepsy. Most of the research in the past has focused on extracting features for two way classification of EEG signals (epileptic and non-epileptic). Not a lot of focus has been laid on feature extraction for the 3-way classification of EEG signals for epilepsy detection. This is because most of the researchers believe that the features that are used for 2 way classification of EEG signals could be used for 3 way classification of EEG signals. In this paper, we have tried to prove that the features used for 2 way classification cannot be used for 3-way classification. We have chosen the set of features that are significant for 2-way classification(p-value<0.05) and have tested them for 2-way and 3-way classification. The results that we obtained clearly show that the features that are used for 2-way classification cannot be used for 3-way classification.

Fast classifying P300s is vital for the good performance of P300-based BCIs. However, due to noisy background electroencephalography (EEG) environments, current P300-based BCI systems need to collect multiple trials for a reliable output, which is inefficient. This study compared a recently developed algorithm, i.e. discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM), with five traditional classification methods, i.e. linear discriminant analysis (LDA), stepwise LDA, Bayesian LDA, shrinkage LDA and spatial-temporal discriminant analysis (STDA), for the detection of single-trial P300s. Eight subjects participated in the classical P300-speller experiments. Study results showed that the DCPM significantly outperformed the other traditional methods in single-trial P300 classification even with small training samples, suggesting the DCPM is a promising classification algorithm for the P300-based BCI.

Common spatial patterns combined with phase synchronization information for classification of EEG signals	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); Common spatial patterns (CSP); EEG classification; Phase synchronization; Rank-weighted phase lag index; Combined feature	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; MOTOR AREAS; BRAIN; FILTERS; INDEX	The common spatial patterns (CSP) approach is a classical and representative technique of optimizing spatial filters of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the community of brain computer interfaces (BCI). It, however, utilizes only amplitude information of the EEG signals. The phase information of the multi-channel EEG series, on the other hand, plays an important role in characterizing brain activities. In this paper, we consider enhancing the classification performance of CSP by making explicit use of information of the phase synchronization. An index, termed as rank-weighted phase lag index (rWPLI), is introduced to qualify the intrinsic phase synchronization. The rWPLI features are then incorporated into the CSP framework via three ways of feature combinations. The classification experiments on real EEG data sets of BCI competitions show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A New Channel Selection Method using Autoencoder for Motor Imagery based Brain Computer Interface	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 06-09, 2019	Bari, ITALY	IEEE			EEG	To improve the spatial resolution of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, it is conventional to use a large number of scalp electrode while recording oscillatory rhythms in motor imagery based brain-computer interface(MI-BCI). However, this increases the dimension of data and might fail to generalize and thus over-fit. Therefore, it is required to reduce the dimension of input data in an optimal way. In this paper, we propose a method using an artificial neural network to reduce the dimension of EEG for MI-BCI. We train an under-complete sparse autoencoder neural network for each subject separately to encode the EEG data optimally. The optimally encoded EEG trials are then used by the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) method to decode the imagined motor movement. In similar lines, autoencoder was trained on subject independent data. We achieved improved motor imagery classification accuracy when the dimension of the data was almost reduced by half compared to the state-of-art FBCSP. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with Sparse Common Spatial Pattern (SCSP) based channel selection method. The average classification accuracy obtained for 10 subjects is 743 +/- 8.06% with only 13 encoded channels. Also, for the autoencoder trained to be subject independent we obtained an average classification accuracy of 66.64 +/- 3.93% with only 11 encoded channels after cross-validation. The study extends the use of autoencoder neural networks in motor imagery based brain-computer interface and shows significant improvement in performance with reduced data dimension.

One of the challenges that has caught the attention in the area of research of prevention of traffic accidents, it is the generation of mechanisms that contribute to monitoring and evaluating the driver behavior. This paper presents a prediction model based on Machine Learning techniques to detect cognitive states based on the monitoring of the electroencephalographic signals of drivers of vehicles acquired in various real driving scenarios. The proposed prediction model consists of three phases: 1. - Acquisition of electroencephalographic signals from drivers in real time. 2. - Select and extract the main characteristics of the signals. 3. - Develop the prediction model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it was compared with two Machine Learning Techniques: K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LR). The results obtained through the experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has the best performance in the evaluation and prediction of the cognitive workload of the physiological signals of the conductors, with a 93% accuracy in the classification of the information compared to other models that have an 84% and 54% accuracy in the classification.

Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a significant role in assessing the neurophysiology of ADHD because of its ability to reveal complex brain activity. The present study proposes an EEG-based diagnosis system using the phase space reconstruction technique to classify ADHD and control adults. Electric activity is recorded for 47 ADHD and 50 control adults during the eyes-open, eyes-closed, and Continuous Performance Test (CPT) condition. Various statistical features are extracted from Euclidean distances based on phase space reconstruction of signals. The proposed system is evaluated with 2 feature selection methods (correlation-based feature selection and particle swarm optimization) and 5 machine learning methods (neural dynamic classifier, support vector machine, enhanced probabilistic neural network, k-nearest neighbor, and naive-Bayes classifier). Experimental results showed the highest testing accuracy of 93.3% under the eyes-open, 90% under the eyes-closed, and 100% under the CPT condition. This study focused on the utility of phase space reconstruction of brain signals to discriminate between ADHD and control adults.

To determine personalized properties in high dimensional EEG indicators, we introduce a feature mapping layer in stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) that is capable of preserving the local information in EEG dynamics. The ensemble classifier is then built via the subject specific integrated deep learning committee, and adapts to the cognitive properties of a specific human operator and alleviates inter-subject feature variations. We validate our algorithms and the ensemble SDAE classifier with local information preservation (denoted by EL-SDAE) on an EEG database collected during the execution of complex human-machine tasks. The classification performance indicates that the EL-SDAE outperforms several classical MW estimators when its optimal network architecture has been identified.

Smart healthcare systems are one of the important developments recently. Such systems will become a necessary ingredient in our connected living. In this article, we propose a new smart pathology detection system using deep learning, edge computing, and cloud computing. Sensors will capture electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of a person and send the signals to a nearby edge computing server. The server will distribute a preprocessing step to available edge devices. The preprocessed signal will then be sent to a cloud computing server. In the cloud server, a proposed tree-based deep model will extract deep features from the EEG signal. The classified decision of whether the signal belongs to a normal person or a pathological person will be distributed to the stakeholders.

Design: We retrospectively analyzed non-neonates who were treated in our PICU and received amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG). Patients: 27 patients aged between 29 days and 10 0/12 years (median 7.3 months) were included, who received a total of 35 aEEGS. Measurements: aEEG tracings were assessed for background (BG) pattern and its evolution, seizures, and side differences using a visual classification (Hellstrom-Westas). Clinical data were collected from patients' histories and analyzed for correlation with aEEG findings. Main results: While rare in early years, there was an increase in use over time. Most aEEGs were conducted because of (suspected) seizures or for management of antiepileptic treatment. aEEG had low sensitivity but high specificity for recognition of pathological BG pattern with reference to conventional EEG. Worsening of BG pattern or failure to improve was associated with death. Seizure detection rates by aEEG were higher than by clinical observation, especially for identification of non-convulsive epileptic state (ES). Side differences in aEEG were rare, but if present, they were associated with unilateral brain injury. Conclusions: aEEG is useful for the detection of seizures and ES in pediatric intensive care patients. Abnormal BG pattern and poor evolution of BG are negatively associated with survival. aEEG is a potential supplement to conventional EEG, facilitating long-term surveillance of cerebral function when continuous full-channel EEG is not available. Further investigation is needed.

Rhythmic Temporal Expectation Boosts Neural Activity by Increasing Neural Gain	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory processing; magnetoencephalography; multivariate decoding; rhythm processing; sensory prediction; temporal orienting	MULTIVARIATE PATTERN-ANALYSIS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; ATTENTION; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; MECHANISM; RESPONSES	Temporal orienting improves sensory processing, akin to other top- down biases. However, it is unknown whether these improvements reflect increased neural gain to any stimuli presented at expected time points, or specific tuning to task-relevant stimulus aspects. Furthermore, while other top- down biases are selective, the extent of trade-offs across time is less well characterized. Here, we tested whether gain and/or tuning of auditory frequency processing in humans is modulated by rhythmic temporal expectations, and whether these modulations are specific to time points relevant for task performance. Healthy participants (N = 23) of either sex performed an auditory discrimination task while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Acoustic stimulation consisted of sequences of brief distractors interspersed with targets, presented in a rhythmic or jittered way. Target rhythmicity not only improved behavioral discrimination accuracy and M/EEG-based decoding of targets, but also of irrelevant distractors preceding these targets. To explain this finding in terms of increased sensitivity and/or sharpened tuning to auditory frequency, we estimated tuning curves based on M/EEG decoding results, with separate parameters describing gain and sharpness. The effect of rhythmic expectation on distractor decoding was linked to gain increase only, suggesting increased neural sensitivity to any stimuli presented at relevant time points.

The quality of life degrades with the advancement of the disease. In this paper, we propose a natural (time) domain technique for the diagnosis of PD. The proposed technique eliminates the need for transformation of the signal to other domains by extracting the feature of electroencephalography signals in the time domain. We hypothesize that two inter-channel similarity features, correlation coefficients and linear predictive coefficients, are able to detect the PD signals automatically using support vector machines classifier with third degree polynomial kernel. A progressive feature addition analysis is employed using selected features obtained based on the feature ranking and principal component analysis techniques. The proposed approach is able to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99.1 +/- 0.1%. The presented computer-aided diagnosis system can act as an assistive tool to confirm the finding of PD by the clinicians.

Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface: Neural Network Approach	OPTICAL MEMORY AND NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						committee of neural networks; local approximation; spectral power; radial basis functions; EEG-patterns classification; motor imagery; cross-correlation	TRANSFORM	A neural network approach has been developed for detecting EEG patterns accompanying the implementation of motor imagery, which are mental equivalents of real movements. The method is based on Local Approximation of Spectral Power using Radial Basis Functions (LASP-RBF) and the original algorithm for interpreting the time sequence of neural network responses. An asynchronous neural interface has been created, the basic element of which is a committee of three neural networks providing the classification of target EEG patterns accompanying the execution of motor imagery by the upper and lower limbs. A comparative evaluation of the classification efficiency of EEG patterns of mental equivalents of real movements was carried out using the developed classifier and traditional classification methods in particular, Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Linear Regression methods. It was shown that the classification accuracy using the developed approach is higher (up to 90%) than other classifiers.	[Lazurenko, D. M.; Kiroy, V. N.; Shepelev, I. E.; Podladchikova, L.

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in drug addiction. However, the mechanism underlying systems-level neuroadaptations in PFC during abstinence has not been fully characterized. The objective of our study was to determine what neural oscillatory activity contributes to the chronic effect of opiate exposure and whether the activity could be coupled to neurovascular information in the PFC. We employed resting-state functional connectivity to explore alterations in 8 patients with heroin dependency who stayed abstinent (>3 months; HD) compared with 11 control subjects. A non-invasive neuroimaging strategy was applied to combine electrophysiological signals through electroencephalography (EEG) with hemodynamic signals through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The electrophysiological signals indicate neural synchrony and the oscillatory activity, and the hemodynamic signals indicate blood oxygenation in small vessels in the PFC. A supervised machine learning method was used to obtain associations between EEG and fNIRS modalities to improve precision and localization. HD patients demonstrated desynchronized lower alpha rhythms and decreased connectivity in PFC networks. Asymmetric excitability and cerebrovascular injury were also observed. This pilot study suggests that cerebrovascular injury in PFC may result from chronic opiate intake.

However, since the sensory and cognitive systems cannot be measured objectively, it is difficult to measure cybersickness. Therefore, methodologies for measuring cybersickness have been studied in various ways. Traditional studies have collected answers to questionnaires or analyzed EEG data using machine learning algorithms. However, the system relying on the questionnaires lacks objectivity, and it is difficult to obtain highly accurate measurements with the machine learning algorithms in previous studies. In this work, we apply and compare Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning algorithms for objective cybersickness measurement from EEG data. We also propose a data preprocessing for learning and signal quality weights allowing us to achieve high performance while learning EEG data with the deep learning algorithms. Besides, we analyze video characteristics where cybersickness occurs by examining the 360 video stream segments causing cybersickness in the experiments. Finally, we draw common patterns that cause cybersickness.

Large dimensional EEG recordings suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio. These signals are very much prone to artifacts and noise, so sufficient preprocessing is done on raw EEG signals before using them for classification or regression. Properly selected spatial filters enhance the signal quality and subsequently improve the rate and accuracy of classifiers, but their applicability to solve regression problems is quite an unexplored objective. This paper extends common spatial patterns (CSP) to EEG state space using fuzzy time delay and thereby proposes a novel approach for spatial filtering. The approach also employs a novel fuzzy information theoretic framework for filter selection. Experimental performance on EEG-based reaction time (RT) prediction from a lane-keeping task data from 12 subjects demonstrated that the proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. A comparison based on root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and correlation to true responses is made for all the subjects. In comparison to the baseline fuzzy CSP regression one versus rest, the proposed Fuzzy Time-delay Common Spatio-Spectral filters reduced the RMSE on an average by $\text{9.94}\%$, increased the correlation to true RT on an average by $\text{7.38}\%$, and reduced the MAPE by $\text{7.09}\%$.

By contrast, few studies have examined bilateral lower-limb motor imagery, and all of them have focused on imaginary foot movements. The left-right classification accuracy reported in these studies based on the EEG mu rhythm (8-13Hz) and beta band (13-30Hz) remains unsatisfactory. The present study investigated the possibility of using lower-limb stepping motor imagery as the mental task and analysed the EEG difference between imaginary left-leg stepping (L-stepping) and right-leg stepping (R-stepping) movements. An experimental paradigm was designed to collect 5-s motor imagery EEG signals at nine recording sites around the vertex of the brain. Results from eight able-bodied participants indicated that the commonly used mu event-related desynchronisation (ERD) feature exhibited no significant difference between the two imaginary movements for all recording sites and all time intervals within the 5-s motor imagery period. Regarding the other commonly used feature, beta event-related synchronisation, no significant difference between the two imagery tasks was observed for most of the recording sites and time intervals. Instead, theta band (4-8Hz) ERD significantly differed between the L- and R-stepping imagery tasks at five sites (FC4, C3, CP3, Cz, CPz) within the first 2s after motor imagery cue onset. The findings from the present study may be a basis for further development of BCI systems for decoding left and right stepping during mental exercise where the two motions are alternately imagined.

Analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) could provide insight information on differences in brain processing. In this work, two machine learning techniques were applied to distinguish EEG signals of normal, poor and capable dyslexic children during writing word and non-word. The performance of k-nearest neighbour (KNN) with correlation distance function and extreme learning machine (ELM) with radial basis function (RBF) were compared. The performance of each classifier was determined using sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It was found that ELM was capable of classifying the dyslexic children with 89% accuracy compared to KNN which is only 83%. These results showed that ELM is feasible and reliable in recognising normal, poor and capable dyslexic children through writing.	[Zainuddin, A. Z.

Detecting the level of attention can help to improve the learning quality. In recent years, there have been several attempts to leverage EEG signal processing as a tool to detect whether a student is attentive or not. In such work, the level of attention is determined by analyzing the EEG power spectrum, which is mostly followed by machine learning approaches. However, the efficiency of such methods for detecting auditory attention of blind or visually-impaired students has not been analyzed. This study aims to investigate such a scenario. To this end, we propose an EEG recording protocol to simulate the learning process of visually-impaired students as closely as possible. Ten different university students participated in the experiment. In the proposed protocol, the EEG signals were recorded by using EMOTIV EPOC+ wireless EEG headset. Then, the power spectrum of the recorded EEG signals was analyzed, and the most relevant features were extracted using the Fisher feature selection method. Then, Linear SVM, RBF SVM, KNN, and LDA classifiers were used to evaluate the proposed protocol. The results of the classification showed that the level of auditory attention could be detected up to 89% accuracy.

Although humans can recognize emotions with little or no effort, reliable emotion recognition by machines is always a challenge. To explore the doubt that whether machines can discriminate better than humans or not, we proposed two different ideas about facial emotion recognition. One is based on image visual features, the other is based on EEG signals which were recorded when the subject is watching facial emotion pictures. Correspondingly, the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model is adopted to enable the machine to learn visual features from facial emotion pictures automatically. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model is used to extract specific emotional EEG features from EEG signals. These two methods were verified on the Chinese Facial Affective Picture System (CFAPS) and our developed Emotion EEG data (EMOT), and the recognition performance based on EEG features was found to be significantly better than the image visual.

PCA is used to collect EEG data characteristics to discriminate the behaviors by SVM methodology. The actual EEG signals are obtained from 18 experimenters who raised hands with meditation and actual movement during the experiments. The 16-channel data from the experiments form one data set. In order to get principal component of EEG signal, 16 features are considered from each channel and normalized. Simulation results demonstrate that two behaviors - i.e., raising hands and meditation - can be clearly classified using SVM, which is also visualized by a 2-dimensional principal component plot. Our research shows that specific human actions and thinking can be efficiently classified based on EEG signals using machine learning techniques like PCA and SVM. The result can apply to make action only with thinking.

Motor Imagery (MI) based BCI systems play a vital role in interacting with the external environment. In this paper, we propose a novel robust feature extraction and classification framework for four class MI classification to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed architecture is developed using log-determinant (log-det) based Regularized Riemannian mean (LDRRM) and linear SVM. The robustness of features extracted from the four class MI data is improved to the outliers and noise by using the proposed LDRRM framework. We evaluated the performance of the proposed LDRRM classification framework on publicly available four class MI dataset 2a of BCI competition IV. The performance results show that the proposed LDRRM classification architecture obtained a mean classification accuracy of 69.12%, also achieved 1.54% higher classification accuracy when compared with the existing studies.

Suitability of an inter-burst detection method for grading hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in newborn EEG	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY					Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important clinical tool for grading injury caused by lack of oxygen or blood to the brain during birth. Characteristics of low-voltage waveforms, known as inter-bursts, are related to different grades of injury. This study assesses the suitability of an existing inter-burst detection method, developed from preterm infants born <30 weeks of gestational age, to detect inter-bursts in term infants. Different features from the temporal organisation of the inter-bursts are combined using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) machine learning algorithm to classify four grades of injury in the EEG. We find that the best performing feature, percentage of inter-bursts, has an accuracy of 59.3%. Combining this with the maximum duration of inter-bursts in the MLP produces a testing accuracy of 77.8%, with similar performance to existing multi-feature methods. These results validate the use of the preterm detection method in term EEG and show how simple measures of the inter-burst interval can be used to classify different grades of injury.

In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded while the human subjects listened to a given set of words from English (familiar language) and Japanese (unfamiliar language). The subjects also provided behavioural signals in the form of spoken audio for each input audio stimuli. In order to quantify the representation level differences for the auditory stimuli of two languages, we use a classification approach to discriminate the two languages from the EEG signal recorded during listening phase by designing an off-line classifier. These experiments reveal that the time-frequency features along with phase contain significant language discriminative information. The language discrimination is further confirmed with a second subsequent experiment involving Hindi (the native language of the subjects) and Japanese (unknown language). A detailed analysis is performed on the recorded EEG signals and the audio signals to further understand the language learning processes. A pronunciation rating technique on the spoken audio data confirms the improvement of pronunciation over the course of trials for the Japanese language. Using single trial analysis, we find that the EEG representations also attain a level of consistency indicating a pattern formation. The brain regions responsible for language discrimination and learning are identified based on EEG channel locations and are found to be predominantly in the frontal region.

Although electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely applied to the diagnosis of tinnitus, there are few machine learning methods developed to classify tinnitus patients from healthy people based on the EEG data. Moreover, there is still room for improving the classification performance due to the insufficient existing studies. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of classification based on the EEG data, we introduce a multi-view intact space learning method to characterize the EEG signals by feature extraction in a latent intact space. Considering the fact that there are only a small number of subjects available for study, we conduct the classification for valid segments of EEG data of each subject. In this way, the dataset can be enlarged and the classification performance can be improved. By combining different views of EEG data, a considerable result is achieved on classification by using Support Vector Machine classifier, with accuracy, recall, precision, F1 to be 99.23, 99.72, 98.97, 99.34% respectively. This proposed method is an effective and objective method to classify the tinnitus patients from healthy people, further researches are needed to explore the machine learning method in classification and prediction of the effectiveness of tinnitus interventions based on the EEG response of tinnitus individuals.

The discriminant features are extracted by the supervised spatio-temporal filters and classified by support vector machine. The EEG signals were recorded from a total of 12 subjects under RSVP task and were used as training and testing data. The average true positive rate of classification is 79%, and the average false positive rate is only 3.4%.

However, the visual evaluation of EEG recordings is a demanding process, susceptible to error and bias due to the human factor involved. The development of EEG analysis methods coupled with data processing and mining techniques have assisted the feature extraction process from EEG recordings. In this paper, a novel method for classification of EEG signals based on features derived from the EEG morphology is proposed. The classification accuracy, as illustrated through experiment evaluation, shows that the proposed method can achieve adequate results and moreover the extracted features can be used collaboratively with commonly used features from time and time-frequency domain to increase the EEG signal's classification performance.

Unlike scalp EEG-fMRI, in most patients who undergo icEEG-fMRI, IEDs recorded intracranially are numerous and show variability in terms of field amplitude and morphology. Therefore, visual marking can be highly subjective and time consuming. In this study, we applied an automated spike classification algorithm, Wave_clus (WC), to IEDs marked visually on icEEG data acquired during simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The motivation of this work is to determine whether using a potentially more consistent and unbiased automated approach can produce more biologically meaningful BOLD patterns compared to the BOLD patterns obtained based on the conventional, visual classification. Methods: We analysed simultaneous icEEG-fMRI data from eight patients with severe drug resistant epilepsy, and who subsequently underwent resective surgery that resulted in a good outcome: confirmed epileptogenic zone (EZ). For each patient two fMRI analyses were performed: one based on the conventional visual IED classification and the other based on the automated classification. We used the concordance of the IED-related BOLD maps with the confirmed EZ as an indication of their biological meaning, which we compared for the automated and visual classifications for all IED originating in the EZ. Results: Across the group, the visual and automated classifications resulted in 32 and 24 EZ IED classes respectively, for which 75% vs 83% of the corresponding BOLD maps were concordant. At the single-subject level, the BOLD maps for the automated approach had greater concordance in four patients, and less concordance in one patient, compared to those obtained using the conventional visual classification, and equal concordance for three remaining patients. These differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: We found automated IED classification on icEEG data recorded during fMRI to be feasible and to result in IED-related BOLD maps that may contain similar or greater biological meaning compared to the conventional approach in the majority of the cases studied. We anticipate that this approach will help to gain significant new insights into the brain networks associated with IEDs and in relation to postsurgical outcome.

Loss Detection of Recurrence Rate in the EEG Signals of Children with ADHD	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						ADHD; EEG; Recurrence plot; Complexity	CLASSIFICATION; COMPLEXITY; NEUROFEEDBACK	Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as an behavioral challenge, which affects the people's learning and experiences, is one of the disorders, which lead to reducing the complexity of brain processes and human behaviors. Nevertheless, most studies on the ADHD have currently focused on the frequency content of single and multichannel EEG segments and a few studies, which have tried to indicate this reduce, employed the approximate entropy, which is usually used for measuring the complexity of EEG signals in terms of their information. In this study, we tried to provided a different view of this reduce by focused on the tissue of patterns appeared on the auto-recurrence plots obtained from the trajectory of phase space reconstructed from the EEG signals recorded under the open-eyes and closed-eyes resting conditions. The outcomes of this analysis generally indicated a significant difference in the tissue of recurrence plots, which its reason was the increase of recurrence rate in the plots. Separating children with ADHD using the support vector machines with the radial basis function kernel developed by the features extracted from the recurrence plots also provided a remarkable accuracy (91.3% for the testing sets), which means the change in the tissue of recurrence plots relevant to the EEG signals of ADHD children. Comparing the classification results of this research and previous researches nonetheless represented that the statistical population usually affects this accuracy. Therefore, these findings generally proved that although the classifiers developed by an EEG segment are not applicable to clinical conditions, the ADHD averagely leads to reducing the complexity of EEG processes.

This paper presents results of experiments on the group of 30 patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders and 41 members of the control group. All subjects were performing the Iowa Gambling Task that is often used for decision process investigations. The electroencephalographical activity of participants was recorded using the dense array amplifier. The most frequently active Brodmann Areas were estimated by means of the photogrammetry techniques and source localization algorithms. The analysis was conducted in the full frequency as well as in alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta bands. Next the mean electric charge flowing through each of the most frequently active areas and for each frequency band was calculated. The comparison of the results obtained for the subjects and the control groups is presented. The difference in activity of the selected Brodmann Areas can be observed in all variants of the task. The hyperactivity of amygdala is found in both the patients and the control group. It is noted that the somatosensory association cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and primary visual cortex play an important role in the decision-making process as well. Some of our results confirm the previous findings in the fMRI experiments. In addition, the results of the electroencephalographic analysis in the broadband as well as in specific frequency bands were used as inputs to several machine learning classifiers built in Azure Machine Learning environment. Comparison of classifiers' efficiency is presented to some extent and finding the most effective classifier may be important for planning research strategy toward finding decision-making biomarkers in cortical activity for both healthy people and those suffering from psychiatric disorders.

Recently, transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used in brain-computer interface (BCI) research to reduce the training/calibration requirements. BCI systems have been designed to provide alternative communication or control access through computers to individuals with limited speech and physical abilities (LSPA). These systems generally require a calibration session in order to train the BCI before each usage. Such a calibration session may be burdensome for the individuals with LSPA. In this article, we introduce a multimodal hybrid BCI based on electroencephalography (EEG) and functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) and present a TL approach to reduce the calibration requirements. In the hybrid BCI, EEG, and fTCD are used simultaneously to measure the electrical brain activity and cerebral blood velocity, respectively, in response to motor imagery (MI) tasks. Using the data we collected from ten healthy individuals, we perform dimensionality reduction utilizing regularized discriminant analysis (RDA). Using the scores from RDA, we learn class conditional probabilistic distributions for each individual. We use these class conditional distributions to perform TL across different participants. More specifically, in order to reduce the calibration requirements for each individual, we choose the recorded data from other individuals to augment the training data for that specific individual. We choose the data for augmentation based on the probabilistic similarities between the class conditional distributions. For the final classification, we use the RDA scores after TL as features input to three different classifiers: quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machines (SVMs). Using our experimental data, we show that TL decreases the calibration requirements up to 87.5%. Also by comparing SVM, LDA, and QDA, we observe that the SVM provides the best classification performance.

SVMs are one of the robust machine learning techniques and have been extensively used in many application areas. The kernel parameter's setting for SVMs in training process effects the classification accuracy. We used GA- and PSO-based approach to optimize the SVM parameters. Compared to the GA algorithm, the PSO-based approach significantly improves the classification accuracy. It is shown that the proposed Hybrid SVM can reach a classification accuracy of up to 99.38% for the EEG datasets. Hence, the proposed Hybrid SVM is an efficient tool for neuroscientists to detect epileptic seizure in EEG.

Different methods for artifact detection and removal are discussed in the literature, including automatic detection and removal. Here, an automatic method of eye blink detection and correction is proposed where sparse coding is used for an electroencephalogram dataset. In this method, a hybrid dictionary based on a ridgelet transformation is used to capture prominent features by analyzing independent components extracted from a different number of electroencephalogram channels. In this study, the proposed method has been tested and validated with five different datasets for artifact detection and correction. Results show that the proposed technique is promising as it successfully extracted the exact locations of eye blinking artifacts. The accuracy of the method (automatic detection) is 89.6% which represents a better estimate than that obtained by an extreme machine learning classifier.

The commonly used feature extraction methods focus on analyzing the smoothness of EEG signals. This paper proposes a method for extracting motor imagery EEG features in phase space. The phase space reconstruction method in nonlinear time series is applying for reconstructing the EEG sequence into high-dimensional phase space. While retaining the continuity of the original signal, many nonlinear dynamic characteristics in the EEG signal can also be found. This paper analyzes the motor imagery EEG from BCI competition database, reconstructs the original one-dimensional EEG signal into high-dimensional phase space by phase space reconstruction, and the "OVR-OVO" common spatial pattern double-layer filter is used to extract the phase space CSP feature (PSCSP). Finally, the classification result on the support vector machine is obtained by voting method. The final classification results show that the classification accuracy of the PSCSP introduced in this paper is 6.39% higher than that of the competition winner. According to the Kappa coefficient evaluation standard provided by the competition, the Kappa coefficient of this method is well performed. It is 9% higher than the first winner of the competition.

While opening new frontiers in productivity and lifestyle, such environments also create hazards related to the inability of human individuals to maintain focus and concentration during passive control tasks. A passive brain-computer interface for monitoring mental attention states of human individuals (focused, unfocused, and drowsy) by using electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity imaging and machine learning data analysis methods is developed in this work. An EEG data processing pipeline and a machine learning mental state detection algorithm using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method were designed and compared with k-Nearest Neighbor and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System methods. To collect 25 h of EEG data from 5 participants, a classic EEG headset was modified. We found that the changes in EEG activity in frontal and parietal lobes occurring at 1-5 Hz and 10-15 Hz frequency bands were associated with the changes in individuals' attention state. We demonstrated the ability to use such changes to identify individuals' attention state with 96.70% (best) and 91.72% (avg.) accuracy in experimental settings using a version of continuous performance task with SVM-based mental state detector. The findings help guide the design of future systems for monitoring the state of human individuals by means of EEG brain activity data. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Biomarkers of PC mechanisms may aid precision medicine for chronic pain. Here, we investigate EEG biomarkers using mass univariate and multivariate (machine learning) approaches. We test theoretical notions that PC results from a combination of augmented aversive-value encoding ("magnification") and persistent expectations of pain ("rumination"). Healthy individuals with high or low levels of PC underwent an experimental pain model involving nociceptive laser stimuli preceded by cues predicting forthcoming pain intensity. Analysis of EEG acquired during the cue and laser stimulation provided event-related potentials (ERPs) identifying spatially and temporally-extended neural representations associated with pain catastrophizing. Specifically, differential neural responses to cues predicting high vs. low intensity pain (i.e. aversive value encoding) were larger in the high PC group, largely originating from mid-cingulate and superior parietal cortex. Multivariate spatiotemporal EEG patterns evoked from cues with high aversive value selectively and significantly differentiated the high PC from low PC group (64.6% classification accuracy). Regression analyses revealed that neural patterns classifying groups could be partially predicted (R-2 = 28%) from those neural patterns classifying the aversive value of cues. In contrast, behavioural and EEG analyses did not provide evidence that PC modifies more persistent effects of prior expectation on pain perception and nociceptive responses. These findings support the hypothesis of magnification of aversive value encoding but not persistent expression of expectation in pain catastrophizers. Multivariate patterns of aversive value encoding provide promising biomarkers of maladaptive cognitive responses to chronic pain that have future potential for psychological treatment development and clinical stratification.

In addition, it is well-known that due to non-stationarity based covariate shifts, the input data distributions of EEG-based BCI systems change during inter- and intra-session transitions, which poses great difficulty for developments of online adaptive data-driven systems. Ensemble learning approaches have been used previously to tackle this challenge. However, passive scheme based implementation leads to poor efficiency while increasing high computational cost. This paper presents a novel integration of covariate shift estimation and unsupervised adaptive ensemble learning (CSE-UAEL) to tackle non-stationarity in motor-imagery (MI) related EEG classification. The proposed method first employs an exponentially weighted moving average model to detect the covariate shifts in the common spatial pattern features extracted from MI related brain responses. Then, a classifier ensemble was created and updated over time to account for changes in streaming input data distribution wherein new classifiers are added to the ensemble in accordance with estimated shifts. Furthermore, using two publicly available BCI-related EEG datasets, the proposed method was extensively compared with the state-of-the-art single-classifier based passive scheme, single classifier based active scheme and ensemble based passive schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed active scheme based ensemble learning algorithm significantly enhances the BCI performance in MI classifications. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In particular, accurately decoding a pilot's mental state is a critical issue as more than 70% of aviation accidents are caused by human factors, such as fatigue or drowsiness. In this study, we report the classification of not only two mental states (i.e., alert and drowsy states) but also five drowsiness levels from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first to classify drowsiness levels in detail using only EEG signals. We acquired EEG data from ten pilots in a simulated night flight environment. For accurate detection, we proposed a deep spatio-temporal convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory network (DSTCLN) model. We evaluated the classification performance using Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) values for two mental states and five drowsiness levels. The grand-averaged classification accuracies were 0.87 (+/- 0.01) and 0.69 (+/- 0.02), respectively. Hence, we demonstrated the feasibility of classifying five drowsiness levels with high accuracy using deep learning.

More recently the advances in medical imaging techniques have resulted in a better understanding of brain activity. These techniques (e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging) have allowed researchers to generate applications that are based on the enhanced understanding of brain function. Detection of concealed information using brain activity is explored in this study as a better alternative to a Polygraph. Electroencephalography (EEG) allows decoding brain signals with a higher temporal resolution by applying smart signal processing techniques. In this work a commercial off the shelf wearable EEG headset is used to record brain signals in an information concealment testing environment. Although the use of such setup restricts the number of EEG channels available to the detection algorithm, but it provides portability and ease of use when compared to clinical EEG setup. The proposed algorithm is designed to give optimum results in terms of accuracy and computation time with emphasis on an easily deployable system.

This method uses wavelet analysis and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) to analyze EEG signals and optimizes the characteristics through Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). Finally, the 14 sub features are optimized by GA, and the weights and data credibility of different sub features are obtained. The experiment was tested with 2003BCI competition data and the EEG signal collected by the laboratory. The accuracy rate of competition data was increased from about 75% before weighting to more than 80% after weighting, and the laboratory data increased from about 65% before weighting to about 75% after weighting. Experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of EEG signals, and the most useful EEG signals can be extracted from large amounts of data for feature extraction and classification. Finally, the online test is carried out to further verify the feasibility of the method.

Specifically, we studied a simultaneous hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) by combining steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) and a motor imagery (MI) task. In our BCI system, a user could generate two possible commands by concentrating on one of two vibration stimuli, which were attached to the left and right hand. The statistical method based on the mutual information between the spatial-temporal patterns was used to detect the user's intention of sit or stand from the electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The results of our offline experiments demonstrated the feasibility of hybrid MI-SSSEP based BCI system for decoding sit-to-stand movement intention. It is expected that the proposed method and algorithms can be implanted in the future to control the lower limb exoskeleton robot.

The traditional recognition mode is always devoted to extracting and classifying the spatiotemporal feature information of MI-EEG in the sensor domain, but these brain dynamic characteristics, which are derived from the cerebral cortical neurons, are reflected more immediately and obviously with high spatial resolution in the source domain. With the development of neuroscience, the state-of-the-art EEG Source Imaging (ESI) technology converts the scalp signals into brain source space and excavates the way for source decoding of MI-EEG. Minimum Norm Estimate (MNE) is a classical and original EEG inverse transformation. Due to the lack of depth weighting of dipoles, it may be more suitable for the estimation of superficial dipoles and will be slightly insufficient for further source classification. In addition, the selection of a Region of Interest (ROI) is usually an essential step in the source decoding of MI-EEG by Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and the most relevant independent component of original EEG signals is transformed into the equivalent current dipoles to obtain the ROI by ESI. Although the excellent results of this method can be obtained for unilateral limb motor imaging EEG signals, which shows more distinct phenomena of event-related desynchronization (ERD), the decoding accuracy may be restricted for more complex multi-limb motor imagery tasks, whose ERD is no longer evident. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel brain source estimation to decode MI-EEG by applying Overlapping Averaging (OA) in the temporal domain and Weighted Minimum Norm Estimate (WMNE), which overcomes the limitations of general ROI-based decoding methods and introduces weighting factors to complement the estimation of deep dipoles. Its advantages will be evaluated on a public dataset with five subjects by comparing it with MNE, WMNE, sLORETA, OA-MNE and ICA-WMNE. The proposed method reaches a higher average decoding accuracy of 81.32% compared to other methods by 10-fold cross-validation at the same chance level.

The exploration of internal relations between these three aspects is interesting and significant. Currently, video is the most popular multimedia stimuli that can express rich emotional semantics by its visual and auditory features. Apart from the video features, human electroencephalography (EEG) features can provide useful information for video emotion recognition, as they are the direct and instant authentic feedback on human perception with individuality. In this paper, we collected a total of 39 participants' EEG data induced by watching emotional video clips and built a fusion dataset of EEG and video features. Subsequently, the machine-learning algorithms, including Liblinear, REPTree, XGBoost, MultilayerPerceptron, RandomTree, and RBFNetwork were applied to obtain the optimal model for video emotion recognition based on a multi-modal dataset. We discovered that using the data fusion of all-band EEG power spectrum density features and video audio-visual features can achieve the best recognition results. The video emotion classification accuracy achieves 96.79% for valence (Positive/Negative) and 97.79% for arousal (High/Low). The study shows that this method can be a potential method of video emotion indexing for video information retrieval.

It is diagnosed by analyzing a long electroencephalogram (EEG) recording in a clinical environment, which may be much prone to errors and a time-consuming task. In this paper, a methodology for the classification of an epileptic seizure is proposed for analyzing EEG signals. EEG signal is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). A fusion, of the extracted non-linear and spike-based features from each of the IMF signals, is made. The parameters of five machine learning algorithms; k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), extreme learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) are optimized, as well as a set of the significant features is chosen using grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA). These classifiers with their optimized parameters are ensembled together for the classification of epileptic seizures. The results show that ensemble classifier performs better than individual classifier. A comparison of the proposed methodology with state of the art epileptic seizure detection techniques is also made for validation.

However, research in this area requires a specialized workstation. Commercial solutions are unsustainably expensive, can be unavailable in most countries, and are not designed specifically for seizure prediction research. On the other hand, building the optimal workstation is a complex task, and system instability can arise from the least obvious sources imaginable. Therefore, the absence of a template for a dedicated seizure prediction workstation in today's literature is a formidable obstacle to seizure prediction research. To increase the number of researchers working on this problem, a template for a dedicated seizure prediction workstation needs to become available. This paper proposes a novel dedicated system capable of machine learning-based seizure prediction and training for under U.S. $1000, which is significantly less expensive (U.S. $700 or more) than comparable commercial solutions. This powerful workstation will be capable of training sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can be deployed to lightweight wearable devices, which enables the creation of wearable EEG-based seizure early warning systems.

We design the SeizNet, a Convolutional Neural Network for seizure detection. To compare SeizNet with traditional machine learning approach, a baseline classifier is implemented using spectrum band power features with Support Vector Machines (BPsvm). We explore the possibility to use the least number of channels for accurate seizure detection by evaluating SeizNet and BPsvm approaches using all channels and two channels settings respectively. EEG Data is acquired from 29 pediatric patients admitted to KK Woman's and Children's Hospital who were diagnosed as typical absence seizures. We conduct leave-one-out cross validation for all subjects. Using full channel data, BPsvm yields a sensitivity of 86.6% and 0.84 false alarm (per hour) while SeizNet yields overall sensitivity of 95.8 % with 0.17 false alarm. More interestingly, two channels seizNet outperforms full channel BPsvm with a sensitivity of 93.3% and 0.58 false alarm. We further investigate interpretability of SeizNet by decoding the filters learned along convolutional layers. Seizure-like characteristics can be clearly observed in the filters from third and forth convolutional layers.

We investigate the biometric specificity of the frequency following response (FFR), an EEG marker of early auditory processing that reflects phase-locked activity from neural ensembles in the auditory cortex and subcortex (Chandrasekaran and Kraus 2010, Bidelman, 2015a, 2018, Coffey et al 2017b). Our objective is two-fold: demonstrate that the FFR contains information beyond stimulus properties and broad group-level markers, and to assess the practical viability of the FFR as a biometric across different sounds, auditory experiences, and recording days. Approach. We trained the hidden Markov model (HMM) to decode listener identity from FFR spectro-temporal patterns across multiple frequency bands. Our dataset included FFRs from twenty native speakers of English or Mandarin Chinese (10 per group) listening to Mandarin Chinese tones across three EEG sessions separated by days. We decoded subject identity within the same auditory context (same tone and session) and across different stimuli and recording sessions. Main results. The HMM decoded listeners for averaging sizes as small as one single FFR. However, model performance improved for larger averaging sizes (e.g. 25 FFRs), similarity in auditory context (same tone and day), and lack of familiarity with the sounds (i.e. native English relative to native Chinese listeners). Our results also revealed important biometric contributions from frequency bands in the cortical and subcortical EEG. Significance. Our study provides the first deep and systematic biometric characterization of the FFR and provides the basis for biometric identification systems incorporating this neural signal.

Specifically, finding an appropriate feedback protocol is significantly important to improve the effectiveness of the motor training system. To this end, we investigated the electroencephalography(EEG) oscillatory patterns measured by event-related desynchronization (ERD) when sixteen participants accepted the visual and proprioceptive stimulation achieving the kinematic hand grasping movements at three different speeds (i.e. 1/3 Hz, 2/3 Hz and 1 Hz). The EEG results indicated that the ERD patterns showed no significant difference in sensorimotor cortex (i.e. C3 and FC3 channels) by comparing the three conditions. Nevertheless, the 2/3 Hz stimulation speed could achieve a significantly better classification performance than the other two conditions across all participants. Therefore, the visual and proprioceptive electrical stimulation achieving the kinematic hand grasping at 2/3 Hz speed might provide an available approach for the online MI-BCI system based NFT system in the future.

This is characterized by a deficit in the region associated with learning pathways in the brain. Activities in this region can be investigated using electroencephalogram (EEG). In this work, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with Daubechies order of 2 (db2) based features extraction was applied to the EEG signal and the power is calculated. The differences between beta and theta band with responding to learning activities were explored. Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to classify the EEG signal. Performance comparison of Polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel recognizing EEG signal during writing word and non-word is presented in this paper. It was found that SVM with RBF kernel performance was generally higher than that of the polynomial kernel in recognizing normal, poor and capable dyslexic children. The SVM with RBF kernel produced 91% accuracy compared to the polynomial kernel.	[Zainuddin, A. Z.

The framework includes signal frequency unification, signal pairing, signal filtering, signal quantification, and data labeling. Furthermore, this paper contributes to human-environment interaction research, where a field study to understand the influence of environmental features such as varying sound level, illuminance, field-of-view, or environmental conditions on humans' perception was proposed. In the study, participants of various demographic backgrounds walked through an urban environment in Zurich, Switzerland while wearing physiological and environmental sensors. Apart from signal processing, four machine learning techniques, classification, fuzzy rule-based inference, feature selection, and clustering, were applied to discover relevant patterns and relationship between the participants' physiological responses and environmental conditions. The predictive models with high accuracies indicate that the change in the field of-view corresponds to increased participant arousal. Among all features, the participants' physiological responses were primarily affected by the change in environmental conditions and field-of-view. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Since human movements are mainly controlled by the brain, decoding of movements by analysis of the brain activity has great importance. In this paper, we apply fractal analysis to Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal in order to decode simple and compound limb motor imagery movements. The fractal dimension of EEG signal is analyzed in case of left hand, right hand, both hands, feet, left hand combined with right foot, and right hand combined with left foot movements. Based on the obtained results, EEG signal experiences the lowest and greatest fractal dimension in case of both hands movement, and feet movement, respectively. Besides obtaining different fractal dimension for EEG signal in case of different movements, no significant difference was observed in fractal dimension of EEG signal between different movements. The method of analysis employed in this research can be widely applied to analysis of EEG signal for decoding of different movements of human.

We develop a multimodal emotion dataset called SEED-V with 16 subjects. Two classifiers are trained based on the EEG and eye movement signals. Topographic maps are used to depict the neural patterns of EEG signal. The classification result based on EEG, eye movement, and feature level fusion (FLF) reaches the average accuracies of 70.8%, 59.87% and 75.13%, respectively. The experiment result indicates that: a) the EEG and eye movement signals have good discrimination ability for five emotion classification problem; b) the beta and gamma bands of EEG signal have better discrimination ability than the delta, theta and alpha bands; c) the stable neural patterns of different emotions do exist and are common across sessions; and d) the neural pattern of disgust emotion has high gamma response in the frontal area, while fear emotion has low activation at the top of brain in the gamma band.

In this context, here, a data-driven ML system for classifying Electroencephalographic (EEG) segments (i.e. epochs) of patients affected by AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC) individuals, is introduced. Specifically, the proposed ML system consists of evaluating the average Time-Frequency Map (aTFM) related to a 19-channels EEG epoch and extracting some statistical coefficients (i.e. mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and entropy) from the main five conventional EEG sub-bands (or EEG-rhythms: delta, theta, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta). Afterwards, the time-frequency features vector is fed into an Autoeconder (AE), a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Logistic Regression (LR) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier to perform the 2-ways EEG epoch-classification tasks: AD vs HC and AD vs MCI. The performances of the proposed approach have been evaluated on a dataset of 189 EEG signals (63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC), recorded during an eye-closed resting condition at IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino Pulejo of Messina (Italy). Experimental results reported that the 1-hidden layer MLP (MLPi) outperformed all the other developed learning systems as well as recently proposed state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rate up to 95.76 % perpendicular to 0.0045 and 86.84% perpendicular to 0.0098 in AD vs HC and AD vs MCI classification, respectively.

The paper presents the research work on BCI development that communicates between an operator and a robotic gripping device. The control of a BCI robotic hand is broken down into two main subsystems. The first subsystem acquires a signal from the brain through the Emotiv EPOC EEG headset, extracts features and translates them into an input to the control system. The second subsystem incorporates kinematics and feedback from sensors, to control the multiple degrees of freedom used in the gripping device depending on the action specified by the higher-level BCI control. The BCI is trained to filter and extract features relating to the different hand motions from the data sets. Machine learning is used in conjunction with data filtering, feature extraction, and feature classification techniques to create a more accurate and personalized BCI hand control system. The system analyzes the EEG data, compares with the EEG data patterns from previous attempts. The test results demonstrate the movement functions of the gripper using the BCI, and the success rate for each function are presented in this paper.

EEG signals are collected by Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and are utilized to distinguish between ictal and seizure-free signals. Here, we used the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to obtain IMFs from EEG signals for classification of seizure and seizure-free signals. These IMFs are combined with statistical parameters and are used as an input features set to ELM. This method is accurate and provides a better classification of highly densed and complex EEG signals, which are utilized for classification of seizure and seizure-free signals.

In this paper, a massage effect evaluation system based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) is proposed to evaluate the massage effect by measuring the fatigue state. After the original EEG is processed by bandpass filtering and Hilbert-Huang Transform(HHT) denoising, wavelet packet decomposition is used to extract the energy features. Train Support Vector Machine(SVM), Neural Network(NN) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine(LightGBM) models. Then fuse models under Stacking framework and finally estimate the fatigue state of the human body, so as to evaluate the massage effect and guide the parameter design of the massage chair.

In their usage of the electrophysiological recordings, most of the proposals thus far have followed the conventional practise of employing all frequency bands following signal decomposition as input features for a classifier. Although seemingly powerful, this approach may prove counterproductive since some frequency bins may not carry relevant information about seizure episodes and may, instead, add noise to the classification process thus degrading performance. A key thesis of the work described here is that the selection of frequency subsets may enhance seizure classification rates. Additionally, the authors explore whether a conservative selection of frequency bins can reduce the amount of training data needed for achieving good classification performance. They have found compelling evidence that using spectral components with <25 Hz frequency in scalp electroencephalograms can yield state-of-the-art classification accuracy while reducing training data requirements to just a tenth of those employed by current approaches.

A feasible way is to use labeled EEG data from other subjects (source domains) to train a model for classifying EEG data from the new subjects (target domains). However, the model trained using other subjects EEG data may degrade the classification performance of the target subject, when there exists the substantial inter-subject variability of EEG data. In this paper, to account for the domain shift between different subjects, we propose a novel deep domain adaptation network (DDAN) for cross-subject EEG signal recognition. Specifically, a special end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) is firstly adopted to automatically extract deep features from the raw EEG data. Then, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is used to minimize the distribution discrepancy of deep features between source and target subjects. Finally, a center-based discriminative feature learning (CDFL) method is used to force the deep features closer to their corresponding class centers and make the inter-class centers more separable, so that it is possible to further improve the recognition performance of target domain EEG data. Experiments on public EEG datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study may promote the practical use of EEG signal processing technology and expand its application range.

In fact, the complexity of motor-imagination and low amount of signal-to-noise ratio for EEG signal makes this identification as a difficult task. In order to overcome these complexities, many techniques such as various feature extraction methods, learning algorithms, and classifier schemes have been developed in this regard. However, conducting more research is necessary for improvement. The present study aimed to use an ensemble learning approach to improve the performance of MI-BCI systems. Therefore, filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP), as a well-known feature extraction method, was used to produce separable features from EEG signals. Accordingly, error correcting output codes (ECOC) was applied on several learning algorithms to classify four classes of motor imagery tasks. The proposed ECOC ensemble technique was tested on the data set 2a from BCI competition IV. Based on the results, the ECOC can lead to an improvement by using the naive Bayesian parzen window algorithm, compared to the winner algorithm of BCI competition IV, which is superior to other selected state of the art algorithms.

Most machine learning approaches for the filter estimation, however, disregard within-trial temporal dynamics and are extremely sensitive to changes in training data and involved hyperparameters. This leads to highly variable solutions and impedes the selection of a suitable candidate for, e.g., neurotechnological applications. Fostering component introspection, we propose to embrace this variability by condensing the functional signatures of a large set of oscillatory components into homogeneous clusters, each representing specific within-trial envelope dynamics. The proposed method is exemplified by and evaluated on a complex hand force task with a rich within-trial structure. Based on electroencephalography data of 18 healthy subjects, we found that the components' distinct temporal envelope dynamics are highly subject-specific. On average, we obtained seven clusters per subject, which were strictly confinedregarding their underlying frequencybands. As the analysis method is not limited to a specific spatial filtering algorithm, it could be utilized for a wide range of neurotechnological applications, e.g., to select and monitor functionally relevant features for brain-computer interface protocols in stroke rehabilitation.

Most of previous resting state EEG-based authentication systems have used a relatively long EEG data (e.g., > 1 min) measured once, and they were segmented to create many trials (e.g., > 100). In this case, however, it is difficult to reflect real-authentication situations in which a user repetitively uses an authentication system in different time points. Therefore, we propose to use single trials repetitively measured for short time (10 s). In the experiment, resting state EEGs were measured while fifteen subjects opened and closed their eyes 30 times for 10 s each. The measured EEG data were divided into three conditions, which are eyes open (EO), eyes closed (EC), and difference between EC and EO (Diff). We extracted power spectral density (PSD) ranging from 3 to 20 Hz as features for classification, with which a binary classification based on a 5x5-fold cross-validation was performed for each subject using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The mean authentication accuracies of EC, EO, and Diff were 97.05 +/- 5.4, 92.5 +/- 8.2, and 85.3 +/- 7.0 %, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of single-trial-based EEG authentication. EC could be an optimal condition for developing a resting-state EEG authentication system based on single trial.

Such BCIs require calibration sessions which is burdensome for such individuals. We introduce a transfer learning approach for our novel hybrid BCI in which brain electrical activity and cerebral blood velocity are recorded simultaneously using Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD) respectively in response to flickering mental rotation (MR) and word generation (WG) tasks. With the aim of reducing the calibration requirements, for each BCI user, we used mutual information to identify the top similar datasets collected from other users. Using these datasets and the dataset of the current user, features derived from power spectrum of EEG and fTCD signals were calculated. Mutual information and support vector machines were used for feature selection and classification. Using the hybrid combination, an average accuracy of 93.04% was achieved for MR versus baseline whereas WG versus baseline yielded average accuracy of 90.94%. As for MR versus WG, an average accuracy of 92.64% was obtained by hybrid combination compared to 88.14% obtained by EEG only. Average bit rates of 11.45, 17.24, and 19.72 bits/min were achieved for MR versus WG, MR versus baseline, and WG versus baseline respectively. The proposed system outperforms the state of the art EEG-fNIRS BCIs in terms of accuracy and/or bit rate.

Using Virtual Reality to Examine the Correlation between Balance Function and Anxiety in Stance	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICINE (BIBM)	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine-BIBM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)	NOV 18-21, 2019	San Diego, CA	IEEE, NSF		Virtual reality; Balance function; Electroencephalogram; Heart rate variability; Co-contraction index; Machine learning	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; POSTURAL CONTROL; ARTIFACTS; SUPPORT; HEIGHT; THREAT	We study the interaction between balance function and anxiety in humans via a virtual reality based experimental setup, fundamentally designed to examine postural control and neurological feedback during balance-demanding height and perturbation shifts, while in quiet stance. In this work, sensory organization balance test (SOT) was utilized to quantify the balance function in subjects, and the salient features of the recorded electrocardiogram (EKG), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals described the subject's physiological anxiety-related responses. Also, patientreported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) trait anxiety questionnaire was adopted to indicate the self-assessed trait anxiety scores by the subjects. Our statistical analysis indicates that subjects with higher SOT scores encounter a lower heart rate variability during baseline recording relative to the experimental trials and lower co-contraction index of the ankle dorsiflexion (during the experimental trials), suggesting a lower anxiety state. A similar trend was further observed via the self-reported PROMIS questionnaire responses, estimating anxiety experienced in daily life. Additionally, we utilize machine learning to describe the predictability of balance function states via the relative a-band power from the frontal channels of the recorded EEG signals as descriptive features characterizing anxiety. The discussed trends analytically demonstrate the potential for adopting balance function to anticipate anxiety, especially in stressful environments involving postural threats.

A new amplitude modulation energy index of the cerebral rhythms is proposed as feature vector concept. The method is proven on a public database and on a set of electroencephalographic data recorded in our own laboratory. In both cases, only eight electrodes are used in order to reach high performance classifying rates. The discrimination of motor tasks (imagination of right and left hand movements) is analyzed by means of five classifiers: support vector machine, k nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis and Mahalanobis distance based classifier. For our database, the medians of the classification rates for two of classifiers are very high (94.62 % - 97.76 %) when some rhythms are modulated in theta and alpha bands Significantly higher classification rates reported herein (greater than 90 % for both of the databases) compared with classifiers trained on the other features prove that the index may be very useful for highlighting the modulation found in certain bands of the EEG rhythms.

In this paper, we propose an automatic electroencephalogram (EEG) pathology detection system based on deep learning. Various types of pathologies can affect brain signals. Thus, the brain signals captured in the form of EEG signals can indicate whether a person suffers from pathology or not. In the proposed system, the raw EEG signals are processed in the form of a spatio-temporal representation. The spatio-temporal form of the EEG signals is the input to a convolutional neural network (CNN). Two different CNN models, namely, a shallow model and a deep model, are investigated using transfer learning. A fusion strategy based on a multilayer perceptron is also investigated. The experimental results on the Temple University Hospital EEG Abnormal Corpus v2.0.0 show that the proposed system with the deep CNN model and fusion achieves 87.96% accuracy, which is better than some reported accuracy rates on the same corpus.

Two patient groups, characterized by visually similar (to neurologists) EEG rolandic spikes, are under classification. The first group consists of patients with benign focal childhood epilepsy. Patients with structural focal epilepsy define the second group. We analyzed 94 EEGs (with known diagnosis) obtained from Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos. The EEGs are preprocessed by applying these steps: (i) spike detection; (ii) extraction of spike parameters. After preprocessing of EEGs we gather parameters of detected spikes into lists of equal length N-spikes. The classification algorithms are trained employing one set of patients (containing patients from both groups) and tested on another non-overlapping set of patients (also from both groups). This prevents artificial accuracy inflation due to overfitting. We compared eight machine learning type classifiers: (1) random forest, (2) decision tree, (3) extremely randomized tree, (4) adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), (5) artificial neural network (ANN), (6) supported vector machine (SVM), (7) linear discriminant analysis (LDA), (8) logistic regression. To estimate quality of classifiers we discuss a set of metrics. The results are following: (I) as expected, for all examined algorithms, the accuracy tends to grow (when N-spikes increases), saturating at some asymptotic value; (II) ANN has prevailed as best classifier. Impact of: (a) different training strategies and (b) spike detection errors on classification accuracy is also discussed. Novelty and originality of this study comes not only from classifying different types of epilepsy, but also from employed computational methodology (involving parameters of EEG spikes and machine learning type classifier), as well as comparing different methodologies of such type, based on their accuracy and other classifier metrics.

However, CNN is known to have a limitation that its classification performance is degraded when the target data are distorted. Particularly in case of electroencephalography (EEG), the signals measured from the same user are not consistent. To address this issue, we propose to apply Capsule networks (CapsNet) which implicitly learn various features, thereby achieving more robust and reliable performance than traditional CNN approaches. In this paper, a novel method based on CapsNet to classify two-class motor imagery signals is presented. The motor imagery EEG signals are transformed into time-frequency images using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and then supplied for training and testing capsule networks. The experimental results on BCI competition IV 2b dataset show that the proposed CapsNet based architecture outperforms previous CNN-based approaches.

The principle of hybridization stands for combining at least two different BCI modalities into a single interface with the aim of improving the information transfer rate by increasing the recognition accuracy and number of choices available for the user. This study proposes a simultaneous hybrid BCI system that recognizes the motor imagery (MI) and the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) using the EEG signals from a dual-channel EEG setting with sensors placed over the central area (C3 and C4 channels). The data processing implements a supervised optimization algorithm for the feature extraction, named the common frequency pattern, which finds the optimal spectral filter that maximizes the separability of the data by classes. The experiment compares the classification accuracy in a two-class task using the MI, SSVEP and hybrid approaches on seventeen healthy 18-29 years old subjects with various dual-channel setups and complete set of thirty EEG electrodes. The designed system reaches a high accuracy of 97.4 +/- 1.1% in the hybrid task using the C3-C4 channel configuration, which is marginally lower than the 98.8 +/- 0.5% accuracy achieved with the complete set of channels while applying the support vector classifier; in the plain SSVEP task the accuracy drops from 91.3 +/- 3.9% to 86.0 +/- 2.5% while moving from the occipital to central area under the dual-channel condition. The results demonstrate that by combining the principles of hybridization and data-driven spectral filtering for the feature selection it is feasible to compensate a lack of spatial information and implement the proposed BCI using a portable few channel EEG device even under sub-optimal conditions for the sensors placement.

Epileptic Seizure Detection Based on Bandwidth Features of EEG Signals	FIFTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	5th Information Systems International Conference (ISICO) on Role of Information Systems in Industry 4.0	JUL 23-24, 2019	Surabaya, INDONESIA	Inst Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Informat Syst		EEG; Empirical Mode Decomposition; epilepsy; machine learning		Detection of seizure from EEG signals may help neurologist analyze the condition of epileptic patients. Variance in types of epileptic seizures provides challenge in recognizing the pattern of seizure signals from normal ones. In this paper, we discuss the classification of seizure and non-seizure conditions in epilepsy based on bandwidth features of EEG signals. These features were extracted using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). This method decomposes signal into eight Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and its residue. The IMFs is then analyzed by Hilbert transform to obtain amplitude modulation bandwidth (BAM) and frequency modulation bandwidth (BFM). These features are fed as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM). We propose to combine the first four IMFs to extract bandwidth features and we implement this method on two data sets, public data set that contains signals from both extracranial and intracranial EEG, and data set OF Rumah Sakit Universitas Airlangga (RSUA) that contains signals from extracranial EEG only. The results showed that in general, the values of accuracy and specificity using combined features of first four IMFs outperformed those using features of single IMF, for all SVM kernel functions. The best accuracy and specificity on public data set were 97.3% and 98.25% respectively using RBF kernel, while the best sensitivity was gained using polynomial kernel based on only IMF1 bandwidth features by 99.0%. The experiments on RSUA data showed that the best accuracy was 96.5% and the best specificity was 99.38% when using Mexican Hat kernel based on combined features of first four IMFs, while the best sensitivity was 94% when using polynomial kernel based on only IMF1 bandwidth features.

Graph signal processing (GSP) concepts are exploited for brain activity decoding and particularly the detection and recognition of a motor imagery (MI) movement. A novel signal analytic technique that combines graph Fourier transform (GFT) with estimates of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and discriminative learning is introduced as a means to recover the subject's intention from the multichannel signal. Approach. Adopting a multiview perspective, based on the popular concept of co-existing and interacting brain rhythms, a multilayer network model is first built from empirical data and its connectivity graph is used to derive the GFT-basis. A personalized decoding scheme supporting a binary decision, either 'left versus right' or 'rest versus MI', is crafted from a small set of training trials. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity from 12 volunteers recorded during two randomly alternating, externally cued, MI tasks (clenching either left or right fist) and a rest condition is used to introduce and validate our methodology. In addition, the introduced methodology was further validated based on dataset IVa of BCI III competition. Main results. Our GFT-domain decoding scheme achieves nearly optimal performance and proves superior to alternative techniques that are very popular in the field. Significance. At a conceptual level, our work suggests a fruitful way to introduce network neuroscience in BCI research. At a more practical level, it is characterized by efficiency. Training is realized using a small number of exemplar trials and decoding requires very simple operations that leaves room for real-time implementation.

However, the suppression of the inter-subject variability (ISV) remains as a major challenge in constructing a reliable EEG-based BCI model. Subject-specific classification models have been widely used to avoid ISV, however these inherently involve time-consuming individual calibration process. This study speculated that the calibration could be minimized via clustering BCI subjects into subgroups by their respective similarity in brain power distribution at the resting state and conducted a proof-of-concept investigation. EEG recordings of twenty-nine healthy subjects from open motor imagery (MI) dataset were used in this study. K-means clustering based on brain activation in a, low beta and high beta-band at resting state divided the subjects into three subgroups. The efficacy of band-clustering was evaluated by comparing its MI classification performance (left- or right-hand gripping) to subject-specific and general models. Among the subjects in a cluster, ISV was lower than that in twenty-nine subjects, especially in the alpha-band. The MI classification accuracy using the cluster-specific model on the a-band was marked high performance (median accuracy 68.8%). The cluster-specific model had significantly high accuracy compared to general model (median accuracy = 64.6%). Furthermore, the difference of MI classification accuracy between the cluster-specific model on the alpha band and subject-specific model is not significant (median accuracy = 69.3%). Consequently, establishing a model by grouping clusters using similar brain activation patterns was highly beneficial for the MI classification without individual calibration process.

It is hard to recognize them, but very important so that we can provide intervention before them getting worse. This study used EEG signals to recognize who has high risk for emotional disorders instead of emotion type only. The proposed machine learning method combined the features of multiple cortex areas and frequency bands to find the high risky group for emotional disorders through a kernel SVM classifier. It achieved the accuracy of 95.20%, with all cortex areas and all frequency bands. Results showed that the frontal cortex, central cortex and temporal cortex have a primary influence on identifying emotional disorder and can be used for the reference information for professional diagnose.

In this paper, a hybrid method consisting of multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and common space pattern (CSP) is proposed to recognize left-hand and right-hand hypothetical motion from EEG signals. Experiments were carried out using the BCI competition II imagery database. EEG signals were decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by MEMD. The IMF functions with high correlation were processed by CSP, and AR coefficients and entropy values were extracted as features. After genetic algorithm optimization, classification is carried out. Our research results show that the K nearest neighbor (KNN) as an optimal classification model produces 85.36% accuracy. We also compare the proposed algorithm with the existing algorithms. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to or better than that of many existing algorithms.

In particular, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) show competitive performance to learn the sequential information of the EEG signals. However, none of the previous approaches considers recognizing the unknown EEG signals which have never been seen in the training dataset. In this paper, we first propose a new scheme for Zero-Shot EEG signal classification. Our EZSL-GAN has three parts. The first part is an EEG encoder network that generates 128-dim of EEG features using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The second part is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that can tackle the problem for recognizing unknown EEG labels with a knowledge base. The third part is a simple classification network to learn unseen EEG signals from the fake EEG features which are generated from the learned Generator. We evaluate our method on the EEG dataset evoked from 40 classes visual object stimuli. The experimental results show that our EEG encoder achieves an accuracy of 95.89%. Furthermore, our Zero-Shot EEG classification method reached an accuracy of 39.65% for the ten untrained EEG classes. Our experiments demonstrate that unseen EEG labels can be recognized by the knowledge base.

Studies of the neural basis and decoding of action observation are important for understanding action-related processes and have implications for cognitive, social neuroscience, and human-machine interaction (HMI). In the current study, we first investigated temporal-spatial dynamics during action observation using a combined 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and 48-channel functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. We measured brain activation while 16 healthy participants observed three action tasks: (1) grasping a cup with the intention of drinking; (2) grasping a cup with the intention of moving it; and (3) touching a cup with an unclear intention. The EEG and fNIRS source analysis results revealed the dynamic involvement of both the mirror neuron system (MNS) and the theory of mind (ToM)/mentalizing network during action observation. The source analysis results suggested that the extent to which these two systems were engaged was determined by the clarity of the intention of the observed action. Based on the difference in neural activity observed among different action-observation tasks in the first experiment, we conducted a second experiment to classify the neural processes underlying action observation using a feature classification method. We constructed complex brain networks based on the EEG and fNIRS data. Fusing features from both EEG and fNIRS complex brain networks resulted in a classification accuracy of 72.7% for the three action observation tasks. This study provides a theoretical and empirical basis for elucidating the neural mechanisms of action observation and intention understanding, and a feasible method for decoding the underlying neural processes.

J	Wang, C; Xu, J; Zhao, SZ; Lou, WT				Wang, Chao; Xu, Jin; Zhao, Songzhen; Lou, Wutao			Identification of Early Vascular Dementia Patients With EEG Signal	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); information flow; machine learning; vascular dementia	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISORDER; SCANS	Effort has been made to find biomarkers for vascular dementia (VaD). Nevertheless, the current findings are typically obtained through statistical tests of group level differences. In clinical practice, however, it is more common to perform individual level inferences, e.g., to determine if a subject is suffering from VaD, which cannot be resolved with statistical analysis. The goal of this study is to develop a method to effectively discriminate early VaD patients from normal controls by combining EEG features with machine learning methods. The EEG signals were recorded from a total of 15 VaD patients and 21 controls during a visual oddball task. Interregional directed connectivity was derived from directed transfer function (DTF) analysis and used as features in classification. Three machine learning methods, including linear discriminant analyais (LDA), error back-propagation (BP) neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) were used as classifiers, and their classification performance was compared. It was found that VaD patients can be effectively identified using the BP and SVM classifiers with high accuracy. In particular, when the SVM classifier was combined with feature selection by Fisher score, it reached an accuracy 86.11%, sensitivity 86.67%, and specificity 85.71%. The area under the curve (AUC, 0.854) indicates a good identification of VaD patients from the normal controls. Since the EEG is noninvasive, inexpensive, and widely available to use, the current study presents a novel clinical application of machine learning methods and could facilitate automatic screening and diagnosis of the VaD at an early stage in future.

Decoding the dynamic representation of facial expressions of emotion in explicit and incidental tasks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Multi-variate pattern analysis; Emotion; Vision; Categorization	TOP-DOWN INFLUENCES; HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM; TIME-COURSE; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; BRAIN; RESPONSES; MECHANISMS; INFORMATION; FEARFUL; PERCEPTION	Faces transmit a wealth of important social signals. While previous studies have elucidated the network of cortical regions important for perception of facial expression, and the associated temporal components such as the P100, N170 and EPN, it is still unclear how task constraints may shape the representation of facial expression (or other face categories) in these networks. In the present experiment, we used Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) with EEG to investigate the neural information available across time about two important face categories (expression and identity) when those categories are either perceived under explicit (e.g. decoding facial expression category from the EEG when task is on expression) or incidental task contexts (e.g. decoding facial expression category from the EEG when task is on identity). Decoding of both face categories, across both task contexts, peaked in time-windows spanning 91-170 ms (across posterior electrodes). Peak decoding of expression, however, was not affected by task context whereas peak decoding of identity was significantly reduced under incidental processing conditions. In addition, errors in EEG decoding correlated with errors in behavioral categorization under explicit processing for both expression and identity, however under incidental conditions only errors in EEG decoding of expression correlated with behavior. Furthermore, decoding time-courses and the spatial pattern of informative electrodes showed consistently better decoding of identity under explicit conditions at later-time periods, with weak evidence for similar effects for decoding of expression at isolated time-windows. Taken together, these results reveal differences and commonalities in the processing of face categories under explicit Vs incidental task contexts and suggest that facial expressions are processed to a richer degree under incidental processing conditions, consistent with prior work indicating the relative automaticity by which emotion is processed. Our work further demonstrates the utility in applying multivariate decoding analyses to EEG for revealing the dynamics of face perception.

Here, we used reaction times and EEG time-series decoding to test the hypothesis that the information flow is reversed when an event is reconstructed from memory, compared to when the same event is initially being perceived. Across three experiments, we found highly consistent evidence supporting such a reversed stream. When seeing an object, low-level perceptual features were discriminated faster behaviourally, and could be decoded from brain activity earlier, than high-level conceptual features. This pattern reversed during associative memory recall, with reaction times and brain activity patterns now indicating that conceptual information was reconstructed more rapidly than perceptual details. Our findings support a neurobiologically plausible model of human memory, suggesting that memory retrieval is a hierarchical, multi-layered process that prioritises semantically meaningful information over perceptual details.

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio and individual differences of EEG can affect the classification results negatively. In this paper, we propose an improved common spatial pattern (B-CSP) method to extract features for alleviating these adverse effects. First, for different subjects, the method of Bhattacharyya distance is used to select the optimal frequency band of each electrode including strong event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns; then the signals of the optimal frequency band are decomposed into spatial patterns, and the features that can describe the maximum differences of two classes of MI are extracted from the EEG data. The proposed method is applied to the public data set and experimental data set to extract features which are input into a back propagation neural network (BPNN) classifier to classify single-trial MI EEG. Another two conventional feature extraction methods, original common spatial pattern (CSP) and autoregressive (AR), are used for comparison. An improved classification performance for both data sets (public data set: 91.25%+/- 1.77% for left hand vs. foot and 84.50%+/- 5.42% for left hand vs. right hand; experimental data set: 90.43%+/- 4.26% for left hand vs. foot) verifies the advantages of the B-CSP method over conventional methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed B-CSP method can classify EEG-based MI tasks effectively, and this study provides practical and theoretical approaches to BCI applications.

An objective, automated method that predicts clinical outcomes in depression is essential for increasing the accuracy of depression recognition and treatments. This paper aims at better recognizing depression using the transformation of EEG features and machine learning methods. An experiment based on emotional face stimuli task was conducted, and twenty-eight subjects' EEG data were recorded from 128-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN) by Net Station software. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used by psychiatrists as the criterion for diagnosis of depression patients. The power spectral density and activity were respectively extracted as original features using Auto-regress model and Hjorth algorithm with different time windows. Two separate approaches processed the features: ensemble learning and deep learning. For the ensemble learning, a deep forest transformed the original features to new features that potentially improve feature engineering and a support vector machine (SVM) that was applied as classifier. For deep learning method, we added spatial information of EEG caps to both features by image conversion and adopted convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize them. The performance of both methods was evaluated for separated and total frequency bands. As a result, the best accuracy obtained was 89.02% when we used the ensemble model and power spectral density. The best accuracy of deep learning method was 84.75% using the activity. These experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed methods and show that EEG could be used as a reliable indicator for depression recognition, which makes it possible for EEG-based portable system design and application in auxiliary depression recognition in the future.

J	Wang, P; Hu, JF				Wang, Ping; Hu, Jianfeng			A hybrid model for EEG-based gender recognition	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Gender recognition; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Entropy measures; Random forest (RF); Logistic regression (LR)	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; AGE	The gender recognition is an important research field to study evidence regarding some personal characteristics in the information and data society. However, some current traditional methods such as vision and sound have been exposed their own security weaknesses. Recently, biometric gender recognition based on Electroencephalography (EEG) signals has been widely used in information safety and medical fields. It is necessary to explore potential of using EEG to present a more robust and accurate result with larger training data based on sophisticated machine learning approaches. In this contribution, we present an automated gender recognition system by a hybrid model based on EEG data of resting state from twenty-eight subjects. These data are useful and handy to get insights into assessing the differences in personal gender. For achieving a good performance and a strong robustness, the system develops a hybrid model of combining random forest and logistic regression, and employs four common entropy measures to analyze the non-stationary EEG signals. Result also suggests that the recognition performance achieve an improved progress with an accuracy of 0.9982 and AUC of 0.9926 based on a nested tenfold cross-validation loop, implying that show a significant potential applicability of the proposed approach and is capable of recognizing personal gender.

Accurate EEG-Based Emotion Recognition on Combined Features Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						EEG; emotion recognition; convolution neural network; combined features; deep learning		In order to improve the accuracy of emotional recognition by end-to-end automatic learning of emotional features in spatial and temporal dimensions of electroencephalogram (EEG), an EEG emotional feature learning and classification method using deep convolution neural network (CNN) was proposed based on temporal features, frequential features, and their combinations of EEG signals in DEAP dataset. The shallow machine learning models including bagging tree (BT), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) models and deep CNN models were used to make emotional binary classification experiments on DEAP datasets in valence and arousal dimensions. The experimental results showed that the deep CNN models which require no feature engineering achieved the best recognition performance on temporal and frequency combined features in both valence and arousal dimensions, which is 3.58% higher than the performance of the best traditional BT classifier in valence dimension and 3.29% higher than that of BT classifier in arousal dimension.

The aim of this research is to develop an advanced method to detect the drowsiness stage in electroencephalogram (EEG), the most reliable physiological measurement, using the promising Machine Learning methodologies. The methods used in this paper are based on Machine Learning methodologies such as stacked autoencoder with softmax layers. Results obtained from 62 volunteers indicate 100% accuracy in drowsy/wakeful discrimination, proving that this approach can be very promising for use in the next generation of medical devices. This methodology can be extended to other uses in everyday life in which the maintaining of the level of vigilance is critical. Future works aim to perform extended validation of the proposed pipeline with a wide-range training set in which we integrate the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal and visual information with EEG analysis in order to improve the robustness of the overall approach.

However, identifying objective biomarkers, prior to or early in the course of treatment that can predict antidepressant efficacy, remains a challenge. Methods: Individuals with MDD participated in a 12-week antidepressant pharmacotherapy trial. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data was collected before and 1 week post-treatment initiation in 51 patients. Response status at week 12 was established with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), with a >= 50% decrease characterizing responders (N = 27/24 responders/non-responders). We used a machine learning (ML)-approach for predicting response status. We focused on Random Forests, though other ML methods were compared. First, we used a tree-based estimator to select a relatively small number of significant features from: (a) demographic/clinical data (age, sex, individual item/total MADRS scores at baseline, week 1, change scores); (b) scalp-level EEG power; (c) source-localized current density (via exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [eLORETA] software). Second, we applied kernel principal component analysis to reduce and map important features. Third, a set of ML models were constructed to classify response outcome based on mapped features. For each dataset, predictive features were extracted, followed by a model of all predictive features, and finally by a model of the most predictive features. Results: Fifty eLORETA features were predictive of response (across bands, both time-points); alpha(1)/theta eLORETA features showed the highest predictive value. Eighty-eight scalp EEG features were predictive of response (across bands, both time-points), with theta/alpha(2) being most predictive. Clinical/demographic data consisted of 31 features, with the most important being week 1 "concentration difficulty" scores. When all features were included into one model, its predictive utility was high (88% accuracy). When the most important features were extracted in the final model, 12 predictive features emerged (78% accuracy), including baseline scalp-EEG frontopolar theta, parietal alpha(2 )and frontopolar alpha(1). Conclusions: These findings suggest that ML models of pre- and early treatment-emergent EEG profiles and clinical features can serve as tools for predicting antidepressant response. While this must be replicated using large independent samples, it lays the groundwork for research on personalized, "biomarker"-based treatment approaches.

Whether and how LSF modulates HSF processing in naturalistic broad-band stimuli is still unclear. Here we used multivariate decoding of EEG signals to separate the respective contribution of LSF and HSF to the neural response evoked by broad-band images. Participants viewed images of human faces, monkey faces and phase-scrambled versions that were either broad-band or filtered to contain LSF or HSF. We trained classifiers on EEG scalp-patterns evoked by filtered scrambled stimuli and evaluated the derived models on broad-band scrambled and intact trials. We found reduced HSF contribution when LSF was informative towards image content, indicating that coarse information does guide the processing of fine detail, in line with coarse-to-fine theories. We discuss the potential cortical mechanisms underlying such coarse-to-fine feedback.

Exploring Machine Learning Approaches for Classifying Mental Workload using fNIRS Data from HCI Tasks	HALFWAY TO THE FUTURE SYMPOSIUM (HTTF 2019)			English	Proceedings Paper	Halfway to the Future Symposium (HTTF)	NOV 19-20, 2019	Nottingham, ENGLAND	ACM SIGCHI		fNIRS; Mental Workload; Machine Learning; Deep Learning	LOAD; SPECTROSCOPY; EEG	Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has shown promise for being potentially more suitable (than e.g. EEG) for brain-based Human Computer Interaction (HCI). While some machine learning approaches have been used in prior HCI work, this paper explores different approaches and configurations for classifying Mental Workload (MWL) from a continuous HCI task, to identify and understand potential limitations and data processing decisions. In particular, we investigate three overall approaches: a logistic regression method, a supervised shallow method (SVM), and a supervised deep learning method (CNN). We examine personalised and generalised models, as well as consider different features and ways of labelling the data. Our initial explorations show that generalised models can perform as well as personalised ones and that deep learning can be a suitable approach for medium size datasets. To provide additional practical advice for future brain-computer interaction systems, we conclude by discussing the limitations and data-preparation needs of different machine learning approaches. We also make recommendations for avenues of future work that are most promising for the machine learning of fNIRS data.

In order to increase the operational dimension of BCIs, this paper proposes a hybrid BCI based on motor imagery and speech imagery. According to one versus one calculation model, common spatial pattern (CSP) is extended to a three-category algorithm. The energy eigenvalues extracted by CSP are combined with synchronization eigenvalues, which are respectively calculated by cross-correlation function and phase locking value (PLV). The maximum difference of synchronization between two mental tasks is considered as a method to confirm the channel pairs. The experimental results of ten subjects show that: the highest average classification accuracy in three mental tasks is speech imagery (74.3%); imagining left hand movement is followed (71.4%); imagining right hand movement is the last one (69.8%). The classification results can be improved by combining synchronization and CSP, and the synchronization from cross-correlation function is better than PLV.

Scalp Electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used as a biomarker to characterize the human emotions on the valence-arousal scale. This work presents a machine learning patient-specific emotion detection (PSED) classification processor based on an eight-channel EEG signal. The proposed PSED classification processor integrates a hardware-efficient feature extraction engine and patient-specific support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate the emotions in real-time. To utilize minimal hardware resources a hardware realizable feature set comprising of power spectral density (PSD), an absolute difference of interhemispheric power asymmetry (IHPD), and the scaled interhemispheric power asymmetry ratio (SIHPR) of eight electrode pairs are evaluated. To avoid high overhead of area and power consumption for an integer divider for SIHPR; simple LUT based divider is proposed that calculates the approximated value of SIHPR with a minimal overhead of 64 Bytes. The classification is performed using a Linear SVM and resulted in an accuracy of 63% and 60% for valence and arousal, respectively, based on the database for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP). The PSED processor is synthesized using a 65nm CMOS technology with an overall energy efficiency of 10uJ/classification.

To connect brain with the outer world, brain computer interfacing (BCI) via Electroencephalography (EEG) signals has received extensive attention. Extracting informative and discriminating features from EEG signals and decomposing the recorded signals into their underlying components is believed to yield compromising results. Different algorithms, therefore, are recently proposed combining signal decomposition techniques (e.g., spectral filterbanks, and Wavelet decomposition) with feature extracting methodologies (e.g., common spatial patterns (CSP), and Riemannian manifold learning). Although coupling filterbanks and Wavelet with the CSP has been investigated, to best of our knowledge, the potentials of coupling Wavelet with Riemannian manifold learning are not yet studied. The paper addresses this gap. In particular, we propose a level-based classification approach that couples the Wavelet decomposition with Riemannian manifold spatial learning (WvRiem). In the proposed WvRiem framework, the EEG signals are decomposed into several components (levels) and then spatial filtering via Riemannian manifold learning is performed on the best level which yields the most discriminating features. The proposed WvRiem is evaluated on the BCI Competition IV2 alpha dataset and noticeably outperforms its counterparts.

Commercially available electroencephalograph (EEG)-based DoA monitors are recommended only for certain anesthetic drugs and specific age-group patients. This paper presents a machine learning classification processor for accurate DoA estimation irrespective of the patient's age and anesthetic drug. The classification is solely based on six features extracted from EEG signal, i.e., spectral edge frequency (SEF), beta ratio, and four bands of spectral energy (FBSE). A machine learning fine decision tree classifier is adopted to achieve a four-class DoA classification (deep, moderate, and light DoA versus awake state). The feature selection and the classification processor are optimized to achieve the highest classification accuracy for the state of moderate anesthesia required for the surgical operations. The proposed 256-point fast Fourier transform accelerator is implemented to realize SEF, beta ratio, and FBSE that enables minimal latency and high accuracy feature extraction. The proposed DoA processor is implemented using a 65 nm CMOS technology and experimentally verified using field programming gate array (FPGA) based on the EEG recordings of 75 patients undergoing elective surgery with different types of anesthetic agents. The processor achieves an average accuracy of 92.2% for all DoA states, with a latency of 1s The 0.09 mm(2) DoA processor consumes 140nJ/classification.

Machine learning without a feature set for detecting bursts in the EEG of preterm infants	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY					Deep neural networks enable learning directly on the data without the domain knowledge needed to construct a feature set. This approach has been extremely successful in almost all machine learning applications. We propose a new framework that also learns directly from the data, without extracting a feature set. We apply this framework to detecting bursts in the EEG of premature infants. The EEG is recorded within days of birth in a cohort of infants without significant brain injury and born <30 weeks of gestation. The method first transforms the time-domain signal to the time-frequency domain and then trains a machine learning method, a gradient boosting machine, on each time-slice of the time-frequency distribution. We control for oversampling the time-frequency distribution with a significant reduction (<1%) in memory and computational complexity. The proposed method achieves similar accuracy to an existing multi-feature approach: area under the characteristic curve of 0.98 (with 95% confidence interval of 0.96 to 0.99), with a median sensitivity of 95% and median specificity of 94%. The proposed framework presents an accurate, simple, and computational efficient implementation as an alternative to both the deep learning approach and to the manual generation of a feature set.

Physically impaired people may perform different motor imagery tasks which could be recorded in a non-invasive way using electroencephalography (EEG). However, the success of the MI-BCI systems depends on the reliable processing of the EEG signals and the adequate selection of the features used to characterize the brain activity signals for effective classification of MI activity and translation into corresponding actions. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) has been the neural network most widely used for classification in BCI technologies. The fact that MLP is a universal approximator makes this classifier sensitive to overtraining, especially with such noisy, non-linear, and non-stationary data as EEG. Traditional training techniques, as well as more recent ones, have mainly focused on the machine-learning aspects of BCI training. As a novel alternative for BCI training, this work proposes an incremental training process. Preliminary results with a non-disabled individual demonstrate that the proposed method has been able to improve the BCI training performance in comparison with the cross-validation technique. Best results showed that the incremental training proposal allowed an increase of the performance by at least 10% in terms of classification compared to a conventional cross-validation technique, which indicates the potential application for classification models of BCI's systems.

Error-related potentials (ErrPs) provide an elegant method to improve such human-machine interaction by detecting incorrect system behaviour from the electroencephalography (EEG) signal of a human operator or user in real time. In this paper, we focus on adaptive subject-independent classification models particularly suitable for the task of ErrP decoding. As such, they provide a promising method to overcome the need of individualized decoding models, which require a time consuming calibration phase. In a comparative study we evaluate the performance of a decoding model solely trained on prior data and the effectiveness of adapting this model to a new subject. Our results show that such a generalized model can decode ErrPs with an acceptable accuracy of (72.73 +/- 5.27)% and that supervised adaptation can significantly improve the accuracy of the generalized model. Unsupervised adaptation did only prove useful for some subjects with high initial model accuracy and requires more sophisticated methods to be practical for a broader range of subjects. Consequently, our work contributes to the development of calibration-free ErrP decoding, which can potentially be used to improve human-robot interaction.

Using multivariate classifiers trained on spectral electroencephalogram (EEG) features, we quantified neural evidence for recognition decisions as a function of time. Classifiers trained on a small portion of the decision period performed similarly to those also incorporating information from previous time points indicating that neural activity reflects an integrated evidence signal. We propose a single-route account of recognition memory that is compatible with contributions from familiarity and recollection signals, but relies on a unitary evidence signal that integrates all available evidence.

An improvement on BCIs could be achieved by enhancing brain signals from the source via subject intention-based modulation. In this work, we aim to investigate the effects of task complexity on performance of motor imagery (MI) based BCIs. In specific, we studied the effects of motor imagery of a complex task versus a simple task on discriminability of brain activation patterns using EEG. The results show an increase of up to 7.25% in BCI classification accuracy for motor imagery of the complex task in comparison to the simple task. Furthermore, spectral power analysis in low frequency bands, alpha and beta, shows a significant decrease in power value for the complex task. However, high frequency gamma band analysis unveils a significant increase for the complex task. These findings may lead to designing better BCIs with high performance.	[Mashat, M.

In this paper, a simplified Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) is used to classify Motor Imagery Electroencephalogram (MI-EEG). The network uses a single feature layer to mine the intrinsic features of EEG sequences, and uses the training time and accuracy to evaluate the classification effect. Different from other methods, CNN integrates feature extraction and predicted classification results to optimize the whole process, which can automatically extract features from original data. Experiments on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b competition dataset and the BCI Competition II Dataset III competition dataset show that the overall performance under SCNN is the best.

J	Fu, Z; Wu, XH; Chen, J				Fu, Zhen; Wu, Xihong; Chen, Jing			Congruent audiovisual speech enhances auditory attention decoding with EEG	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						auditory selective attention; auditory attention decoding; stimulus reconstruction; audiovisual speech; EEG	CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ATTENDED SPEECH; COCKTAIL PARTY; TRACKING; ENVIRONMENT; MODULATION; RESPONSES; CHILDREN; SPEAKER	Objective. The auditory attention decoding (AAD) approach can be used to determine the identity of the attended speaker during an auditory selective attention task, by analyzing measurements of electroencephalography (EEG) data. The AAD approach has the potential to guide the design of speech enhancement algorithms in hearing aids, i.e. to identify the speech stream of listener?s interest so that hearing aids algorithms can amplify the target speech and attenuate other distracting sounds. This would consequently result in improved speech understanding and communication and reduced cognitive load, etc. The present work aimed to investigate whether additional visual input (i.e. lipreading) would enhance the AAD performance for normal-hearing listeners. Approach. In a two-talker scenario, where auditory stimuli of audiobooks narrated by two speakers were presented, multi-channel EEG signals were recorded while participants were selectively attending to one speaker and ignoring the other one. Speakers? mouth movements were recorded during narrating for providing visual stimuli. Stimulus conditions included audio-only, visual input congruent with either (i.e. attended or unattended) speaker, and visual input incongruent with either speaker. The AAD approach was performed separately for each condition to evaluate the effect of additional visual input on AAD. Main results. Relative to the audio-only condition, the AAD performance was found improved by visual input only when it was congruent with the attended speech stream, and the improvement was about 14 percentage points on decoding accuracy. Cortical envelope tracking activities in both auditory and visual cortex were demonstrated stronger for the congruent audiovisual speech condition than other conditions. In addition, a higher AAD robustness was revealed for the congruent audiovisual condition, with reduced channel number and trial duration achieving higher accuracy than the audio-only condition. Significance. The present work complements previous studies and further manifests the feasibility of the AAD-guided design of hearing aids in daily face-to-face conversations. The present work also has a directive significance for designing a low-density EEG setup for the AAD approach.

J	Chen, JX; Jiang, DM; Zhang, YN				Chen, Jingxia; Jiang, Dongmei; Zhang, Yanning			A Common Spatial Pattern and Wavelet Packet Decomposition Combined Method for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENT INFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG; common spatial pattern; wavelet packet decomposition; emotion recognition; SVM	MUSIC; SELECTION; ENTROPY	To effectively reduce the day-to-day fluctuations and differences in subjects' brain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and improve the accuracy and stability of EEG emotion classification, a new EEG feature extraction method based on common spatial pattern (CSP) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is proposed. For the five-day emotion related EEG data of 12 subjects, the CSP algorithm is firstly used to project the raw EEG data into an optimal subspace to extract the discriminative features by maximizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between the two categories of EEG data. Then the WPD algorithm is used to decompose the EEG signals into the related features in time-frequency domain. Finally, four stateof-the-art classifiers including Bagging tree, SVM, linear discriminant analysis and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis are used to make binary emotion classification. The experimental results show that with CSP spatial filtering, the emotion classification on the WPD features extracted with bior3.3 wavelet base gets the best accuracy of 0.862, which is 29.3% higher than that of the power spectral density (PSD) feature without CSP preprocessing, is 23% higher than that of the PSD feature with CSP preprocessing, is 1.9% higher than that of the WPD feature extracted with bior3.3 wavelet base without CSP preprocessing, and is 3.2% higher than that of the WPD feature extracted with the rbio6.8 wavelet base without CSP preprocessing. Our proposed method can effectively reduce the variance and non-stationary of the cross-day EEG signals, extract the emotion related features and improve the accuracy and stability of the cross-day EEG emotion classification. It is valuable for the development of robust emotional brain-computer interface applications.

Brandon			A fast machine learning approach to facilitate the detection of interictal epileptiform discharges in the scalp electroencephalogram	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Interictal epileptiform discharges; EEG; Machine learning; Epilepsy diagnosis; Ensemble classifier; Fast spike detection	AUTOMATED SPIKE DETECTION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; DATABASE; SYSTEM	Background: Finding interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in the EEG is a part of diagnosing epilepsy. Automated software for annotating EEGs of patients with suspected epilepsy can therefore help with reaching a diagnosis. A large amount of data is required for training and evaluating an effective IED detection system. IEDs occur infrequently in the most patients' EEG, therefore, interictal EEG recordings contain mostly background waveforms. New Method: As the first step to detect IEDs, we propose a machine learning technique eliminating most EEG background data using an ensemble of simple fast classifiers based on several EEG features. This could save computation time for an IED detection method, allowing the remaining waveforms to be classified by more computationally intensive methods. We consider several efficient features and reject background by applying thresholds on them in consecutive steps. Results: We applied the proposed algorithm on a dataset of 156 EEGs (93 and 63 with and without IEDs, respectively). We were able to eliminate 78% of background waveforms while retaining 97% of IEDs on our cross-validated dataset. Comparison with Existing Methods: We applied support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, and random forest classifiers to detect IEDs with and without initial background rejection. Results show that rejecting background by our proposed method speeds up the overall classification by a factor ranging from 1.8 to 4.7 for the considered classifiers. Conclusions: The proposed method successfully reduces computation time of an IED detection system. Therefore, it is beneficial in speeding up IED detection especially when utilizing large EEG datasets.

In BCI, certain devices acquire electrical signals from the brain like Electroencephalography (EEG) rhythm and further translate them in accordance to the user given commands. The acquired signals are translated by the BCI to meaningful commands. Common spatial pattern filters' discrimination and channels' number are incorporated for the search of the optimal channel group which is a non-deterministic polynomial (NP) problem. In this work, glow swarm optimization algorithm is used for solving the NP problem of selection of the electrodes that are optimal and that can improve the classification. Experiments were conducted for evaluating the proposed method. And the results of the experiments prove the proposed approach's performance. The channel optimized-Naive Bayes (NB) achieves the best classification accurateness compared to k nearest neighbor (kNN), NB and channel optimized-kNN.	[Joseph, A.

The purpose of this study was to develop an Automated Diagnostic Tool (ADT) to investigate and classify the EEG signal patterns into normal and schizophrenia classes. The ADT implements a sequence of events, such as EEG series splitting, non-linear features mining, t-test assisted feature selection, classification and validation. The proposed ADT is employed to evaluate a 19-channel EEG signal collected from normal and schizophrenia class volunteers. A dataset was created by splitting the raw 19-channel EEG into a sequence of 6250 sample points, which was helpful to produce 1142 features of normal and schizophrenia class patterns. Non-linear feature extraction was then implemented to mine 157 features from each EEG pattern, from which 14 of the principal features were identified based on significance. Finally, a signal classification practice with Decision-Tree (DT), Linear-Discriminant analysis (LD), k-Nearest-Neighbour (KNN), Probabilistic-Neural-Network (PNN), and Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) with various kernels was implemented. The experimental outcome showed that the SVM with Radial-Basis-Function (SVM-RBF) offered a superior average performance value of 92.91% on the considered EEG dataset, as compared to other classifiers implemented in this work.

Complex neural signals like electroencephalography (EEG) are time-varying and has a non-linear relationship with continuous speech. Linear models can decode stimulus features reliably, but the correlation between the reconstructed signal and continuous EEG remain low despite attempts at optimization. In the current application, we demonstrate the utility of a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model to relate various stimuli features such as the envelope, spectrogram to the continuous EEG in a cocktail party scenario. We use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture that has self-connecting loops which help in preserving past information to predict future value. Given that predictability plays a critical role in speech comprehension, we posit that such a neural network architecture yield better results. In attended condition, for native participants, the LSTM models yield 30% and 22% mean correlation improvement and for non-native participants, 43% and 37% improvement over linear models for envelope and spectrogram respectively with EEG. Finally, we have trained a single model to predict the native language of a participant using EEG and it yielded 95% accuracy.

Learning the structures and unknown correlations of a motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) signal is important for its classification. It is also a major challenge to obtain good classification accuracy from the increased number of classes and increased variability from different people. In this study, a four-class MI task is investigated. Approach. An end-to-end novel hybrid deep learning scheme is developed to decode the MI task from EEG data. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts: a. A one-versus-rest filter bank common spatial pattern is adopted to preprocess and pre-extract the features of the four-class MI signal. b. A hybrid deep network based on the convolutional neural network and long-term short-term memory network is proposed to extract and learn the spatial and temporal features of the MI signal simultaneously. Main results. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a hybrid deep network framework to improve the classification accuracy of the four-class MI-EEG signal. The hybrid deep network is a subject-independent shared neural network, which means it can be trained by using the training data from all subjects to form one model. Significance. The classification performance obtained by the proposed algorithm on brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV dataset 2a in terms of accuracy is 83% and Cohen's kappa value is 0.80. Finally, the shared hybrid deep network is evaluated by every subject respectively, and the experimental results illustrate that the shared neural network has satisfactory accuracy. Thus, the proposed algorithm could be of great interest for real-life BCIs.

First, several source reconstruction methods are reviewed and their source-level performances explored, followed by an objective comparison between EEG and MEG from multiple perspectives. Finally, a number of the most recent reports on classification of MCI/AD during resting state using EEG/MEG are documented to show the up-to-date performance for this well-recognized data collecting scenario. It is noticed that the MEG modality may be particularly effective in distinguishing between subjects with MCI and healthy controls, a high classification accuracy of more than 98% was reported recently; whereas the EEG seems to be performing well in classifying AD and healthy subjects, which also reached around 98% of the accuracy. A number of influential factors have also been raised and suggested for careful considerations while evaluating the ML-based diagnosis systems in the real-world scenarios.

Significant differences in emotion perception and processing have been demonstrated between schizophrenia and normal people. Therefore, it is a very effective strategy to use the emotional stimulation as the core means to explore the difference between patients and normal people, and then to develop the discriminative model for patients with schizophrenia. In this paper, emotional images were used to stimulate the two groups (schizophrenia group and control group), and the electrophysiological signals during the experiment were recorded. In the feature extraction phase, the time-domain dynamics and the asymmetry of the hemisphere were considered at different stimulation stages. Finally, five effective machine learning methods were used to distinguish between schizophrenia and healthy controls under positive and negative emotional stimuli, respectively. The experimental results show that the two groups of event-related electrophysiological signals obtained by negative stimulation can be better distinguished than those obtained by positive stimulation. And, this phenomenon is more pronounced in the time window of first second after the stimulus appears. Meanwhile, the highest average F-score with 10-fold crossvalidation strategy can reach 0.994 by combining both support vector machine classifier and grid search methods.

If so, seizure detection could benefit from convolutional neural networks because their visual recognition ability is comparable to that of humans. We explored image-based seizure detection by applying convolutional neural networks to long-term EEG that included epileptic seizures. After filtering, EEG data were divided into short segments based on a given time window and converted into plot EEG images, each of which was classified by convolutional neural networks as 'seizure' or 'non-seizure'. These resultant labels were then used to design a clinically practical index for seizure detection. The best true positive rate was obtained using a 1-s time window. The median true positive rate of convolutional neural networks labelling by seconds was 74%, which was higher than that of commercially available seizure detection software (20% by BESA and 31% by Persyst). For practical use, the median of detected seizure rate by minutes was 100% by convolutional neural networks, which was higher than the 73.3% by BESA and 81.7% by Persyst. The false alarm of convolutional neural networks' seizure detection was issued at 0.2 per hour, which appears acceptable for clinical practice. Moreover, we demonstrated that seizure detection improved when training was performed using EEG patterns similar to those of testing data, suggesting that adding a variety of seizure patterns to the training dataset will improve our method. Thus, artificial visual recognition by convolutional neural networks allows for seizure detection, which otherwise currently relies on skillful visual inspection by expert epileptologists during clinical diagnosis.

EMG- Versus EEG-Triggered Electrical Stimulation for Inducing Corticospinal Plasticity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; corticospinal plasticity; electrical stimulation; myoelectric control; neurorehabilitation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MACHINE INTERFACE; STROKE; REHABILITATION; EXCITABILITY; MODULATION; INDUCTION; RECOVERY; MODEL	Brain-computer interfaces have been proposed for stroke rehabilitation. Motor cortical activity derived from the electroencephalography (EEG) can trigger external devices that provide congruent sensory feedback. However, many stroke patients regain residual muscle (EMG: electromyography) control due to spontaneous recovery and rehabilitation; therefore, EEG may not be necessary as a control signal. In this paper, a direct comparison was made between the induction of corticospinal plasticity using either EEG-or EMG-controlled electrical nerve stimulation. Twenty healthy participants participated in two intervention sessions consisting of EEG-and EMG-controlled electrical stimulation. The sessions consisted of 50 pairings between foot dorsiflexion movements (decoded through either EEG or EMG) and electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve. Before, immediately after and 30 minutes after the intervention, 15 motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited in tibialis anterior through transcranial magnetic stimulation. Increased MEPs were observed immediately after (62 +/- 26%, 73 +/- 27% for EEG- and EMG-triggered electrical stimulation, respectively) and 30 minutes after each of the two interventions (79 +/- 26% and 72 +/- 27%) compared to the pre-intervention measurement. There was no difference between the interventions. Both EEG-and EMG-controlled electrical stimulation can induce corticospinal plasticity which suggests that stroke patients with residual EMG can use that modality instead of EEG to trigger stimulation.

Discovery of key whole-brain transitions and dynamics during human wakefulness and non-REM sleep	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DEFAULT MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INTEGRATED INFORMATION; NETWORK; FMRI; CONSCIOUSNESS; RECHTSCHAFFEN; PRECEDES; PATTERNS; SPINDLES	The modern understanding of sleep is based on the classification of sleep into stages defined by their electroencephalography (EEG) signatures, but the underlying brain dynamics remain unclear. Here we aimed to move significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art description of sleep, and in particular to characterise the spatiotemporal complexity of whole-brain networks and state transitions during sleep. In order to obtain the most unbiased estimate of how whole-brain network states evolve through the human sleep cycle, we used a Markovian data-driven analysis of continuous neuroimaging data from 57 healthy participants falling asleep during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG. This Hidden Markov Model (HMM) facilitated discovery of the dynamic choreography between different whole-brain networks across the wake-non-REM sleep cycle. Notably, our results reveal key trajectories to switch within and between EEG-based sleep stages, while highlighting the heterogeneities of stage N1 sleep and wakefulness before and after sleep.

The goal is to identify how the EEG features of a visual learner differ from those of a non-visual learner. The idea is to measure the students' EEGs during the resting states (eyes open and eyes closed conditions) and when performing learning tasks. For this purpose, 34 healthy subjects are recruited. The subjects have no background knowledge of the animated learning content. The subjects are shown the animated learning content in a video format. The experiment consists of two sessions and each session comprises two parts: (1) Learning task: the subjects are shown the animated learning content for an 8-10 min duration. (2) Memory retrieval task The EEG signals are measured during the leaning task and memory retrieval task in two sessions. The retention time for the first session was 30 min, and 2 months for the second session. The analysis is performed for the EEG measured during the memory retrieval tasks. The study characterizes and differentiates the visual learners from the non-visual learners considering the extracted EEG features, such as the power spectral density (PSD), power spectral entropy (PSE), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The PSD and DWT features are analyzed. The EEG PSD and DWT features are computed for the recorded EEG in the alpha and gamma frequency bands over 128 scalp sites. The alpha and gamma frequency band for frontal, occipital, and parietal regions are analyzed as these regions are activated during learning. The extracted PSD and DWT features are then reduced to 8 and 15 optimum features using principal component analysis (PCA). The optimum features are then used as an input to the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier using the Mahalanobis distance metric, with 10-fold cross validation and support vector machine (SVM) classifier using linear kernel, with 10-fold cross validation. The classification results showed 97% and 94% accuracies rate for the first session and 96% and 93% accuracies for the second session in the alpha and gamma bands for the visual learners and non-visual learners, respectively, for k-NN classifier for PSD features and 68% and 100% accuracies rate for first session and 100% accuracies rate for second session for DWT features using k-NN classifier for the second session in the alpha and gamma band. For PSD features 97% and 96% accuracies rate for the first session, 100% and 95% accuracies rate for second session using SVM classifier and 79% and 82% accuracy for first session and 56% and 74% accuracy for second session for DWT features using SVM classifier. The results showed that the PSDs in the alpha and gamma bands represent distinct and stable EEG signatures for visual learners and non-visual learners during the retrieval of the learned contents.

Fast classifying ERPs is vital for the good performance of ERP BCIs. However, due to noisy background electroencephalography (EEG) environments, current ERP-based BCI systems need to collect multiple trials for a reliable output, which is inefficient. This study compared a recently developed algorithm, i.e. discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM), with five traditional classification methods, i.e. linear discriminant analysis (LDA), four advanced methods of LDA included stepwise LDA, Bayesian LDA, shrinkage LDA and spatial-temporal discriminant analysis (STDA), for the detection of single-trial ERPs with a small number of training samples. Public dataset from RSVP-speller, which would induce ERPs contained N200 and P300 components in ERPs, was addressed in this study. Study results showed that the DCPM significantly outperformed the other traditional methods in single-trial ERP classification in RSVP-based BCI even with small training samples, suggesting the DCPM is a promising classification algorithm for the ERP-BCI.

Brain computer interface for smart hardware device	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RF TECHNOLOGIES-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						BCI; EEG; ZigBee; Arduino		A brain-computer interface, is a direct communication pathway between a human or animal brain and an external device. Work is being done to identify objects, images, videos and their colour compositions. When humans watch the surrounding environment, visual data is processed by the brain, and it is possible to reconstruct the same on the screen with some appreciable accuracy by analysing the physiological data. This data is acquired by using one of the non-invasive techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) in Brain Computer Interface (BCI). The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or 'locked in' by neurological neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain stem stroke, or spinal cord injury. The prototype discussed in this paper works on features learning and classification centric techniques using support vector machine. The suggested pipeline, ensures successful navigation of a robot in four directions in real time with accuracy of 93%.

Visual and automatic classification of the cyclic alternating pattern in electroencephalography during sleep	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Cyclic alternating pattern; Sleep; Visual scoring; Automatic scoring	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; CAP; SLOW; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMPONENTS; SEQUENCES; AROUSALS; FLUCTUATIONS; INFORMATION	Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) is a neurophysiological pattern that can be visually scored by international criteria. The aim of this study was to verify the feasibility of visual CAP scoring using only one channel of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate the inter-scorer agreement in a variety of recordings, and to compare agreement between visual scoring and automatic scoring systems. Sixteen hours of single-channel European data format recordings from four different sleep laboratories with either C4-A1 or C3-A2 channels and with different sampling frequencies were used in this study. Seven independent scorers applied visual scoring according to international criteria. Two automatic blind scorings were also evaluated. Event-based inter-scorer agreement analysis was performed. The pairwise inter-scorer agreement (PWISA) was between 55.5 and 84.3%. The average PWISA was above 60% for all scorers and the global average was 69.9%. Automatic scoring systems showed similar results to those of visual scoring. The study showed that CAP could be scored using only one EEG channel. Therefore, CAP scoring might also be integrated in sleep scoring features and automatic scoring systems having similar performances to visual sleep scoring systems.	[Largo, R.; Lopes, M. C.; Rosa, A.

The selection of the appropriate contact on the DBS lead for optimal clinical efficacy can be challenging, particularly when considering directional leads. Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrocorticography has been utilized to better understand the pathophysiology of PD but a methodology to provide an objective biomarker of effective stimulation has yet to be developed. Using machine learning techniques for feature extraction and classification, we contrast high resolution EEG captured during DBS against its resting state counterpart with the DBS off. We demonstrate, using 16 patients under DBS treatment for movement disorders, EEG's informative capacity to detect both effective DBS and the region undergoing stimulation.

As a step towards full decoding of imagined speech from active thoughts, we present a Bel system for subject-independent classification of phonological categories exploiting a novel deep learning based hierarchical feature extraction scheme. To better capture the complex representation of high-dimensional electroencephalography (EEG) data, we compute the joint variability of EEG electrodes into a channel cross-covariance matrix. We then extract the spatio-temporal information encoded within the matrix using a mixed deep neural network strategy. Our model framework is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long-short term network (LSTM), and a deep autoencoder. We train the individual networks hierarchically, feeding their combined outputs in a final gradient boosting classification step. Our best models achieve an average accuracy of 77.9% across five different binary classification tasks, providing a significant 22.5% improvement over previous methods. As we also show visually, our work demonstrates that the speech imagery EEG possesses significant discriminative information about the intended articulatory movements responsible for natural speech synthesis.

Neonatal seizures	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EPILEPTOLOGIE			German	Article						Epilepsy; Acute symptomatic seizures; Electroencephalogram; Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography; Antiepileptic drugs	RHYTHMIC EEG PATTERNS; BURDEN; ENCEPHALOPATHY; CLASSIFICATION; DURATION; OUTCOMES; NEWBORN; PROFILE; TERM	Seizures are more common in the neonatal period than during any other time of life with an incidence of 1-3 per 1000 live births in term infants and in 1-13% of very low birth weight infants. The majority of neonatal seizures are acute symptomatic seizures. In term infants hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is the most common underlying factor, typically with onset in the first 24h of life. Other causes include stroke, hemorrhages, infections and errors of metabolism. Epilepsy syndromes with onset in the neonatal period include self-limiting familial and non-familial neonatal seizures, early myoclonic encephalopathy and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression pattern (Ohtahara syndrome). Due to the broad differential diagnosis the initial investigations should concentrate on the common etiologies, which require prompt specific treatment and include blood glucose, electrolytes, blood gas analysis, infection screening, cerebral ultrasound scanning and electroencephalography (EEG). The clinical diagnosis of neonatal seizures is unreliable and around 50-70% of the seizures are only electrographically presented. Therefore, in this situation EEG is absolutely necessary to confirm the diagnosis of suspicious clinical symptoms and to determine electrographic seizures and this also correlates with the prognosis. Phenobarbital remains the drug of choice in the treatment of neonates achieving clinical control in 40-60% of cases. The choice of second line antiepileptic drugs (AED) varies considerably and include levetiracetam, phenytoin with midazolam and lignocaine; however, both phenobarbital and phenytoin can increase electroclinical dissociation. If seizures are refractory to treatment and/or the EEG shows suggestive background abnormalities, an early attempt at treatment with pyridoxine, pyridoxal-5-phosphate and folic acid is indicated. The prognosis of neonatal seizures is mainly determined by the etiology. There is increasing evidence that both electroclinical and purely electrographic seizures have equivalent adverse effects on neurodevelopmental outcome.	[Pressler, R.

Improvement in the automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease using EEG after feature selection	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 06-09, 2019	Bari, ITALY	IEEE		Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; Resting-State EEG; Machine learning; Feature selection	DEMENTIA	Improvement in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis using EEG, as a consequence of advances in Machine Learning (ML) techniques, may be a valuable asset to physicians. However, in order to disseminate the use of this technology through distinct areas of the globe, from developed to developing countries, from urban to rural regions and from dense to underpopulated regions, the system must be simple, reliable and economically viable. Towards this goal, we evaluated automatic AD-EEG diagnosis accuracy changes before and after feature selection. Nineteen AD patients and 17 healthy subjects (HS) had their resting-state 32-channel EEG recorded for 25 minutes. Power spectrum density (PSD) in bands delta (1.5 - 6 Hz), theta (6.5 - 8 Hz), alpha1 (8.5 10 Hz), alpha2 (10.5 - 12 Hz), beta1 (12.5 - 18 Hz), beta2 (18.5 - 21 Hz) and beta3 (21.5 - 30 Hz) were extracted from EEG signals. After that, participants were automatically classified as AD or HS with eight different machine learning algorithms under Regression, Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Ensemble categories. Lastly, feature selection (FS) yielded a robust reduction to the number of features and channels needed and also improved classification performance. After FS, the Regression, SVM and Ensemble categories displayed average accuracy of 95.6% (92.86 - 97.14), F1 score of 97.74% (96.3 - 98.55), channel numbers 25.88 (10.4 - 31) and number of features 68.52 (13.18 - 93.4). Our results suggest that reducing the number of features and channels may not only optimize the computational and equipment cost, as well as EEG test preparation time and complexity (due to the reduced number of channels), but also increase the discriminatory power of classifiers.

Methods: Video-electroencephalography monitoring records of 20 patients with temporal lobe seizures (TLS) and 20 with PNES were retrospectively reviewed (n = 138 seizures,48 TLS and 90 PNES). We analyzed the semiology of 59 behaviors of interest for their presence, duration, sequence, and continuity using quantified measures that were entered into statistical analysis. Results: We identified discontinuity as the parameter that was clearly distinct between PNES and epileptic TLS events: there were significantly more frequent pauses of behavior (i.e., "on-off' pattern) in PNES compared with TLS (P = 0.012). The frequency of pauses during an event was diagnostic of PNES events. For instance, the presence of 2 "pauses" during an episode determines a 69% probability of the seizure being nonepileptic. Moreover, PNES events had significantly greater duration (143 s) than TLS events (68 s) (excluding outliers, P = 0.002) and greater duration variability from one event to another in the same subject (P = 0.005). Significance: Our work provides the first quantified measure of behavioral semiology during epileptic and nonepileptic seizures and offers novel behavioral measures to differentiate them from each other.

Sleep disorders are common complications of PD and affected by subthalamic DBS treatment. To achieve more precise neuromodulation, chronic sleep monitoring and closed-loop DBS toward sleep-wake cycles could potentially be utilized. Local field potential (LFP) signals that are sensed by the DBS electrode could be processed as primary feedback signals. This is the first study to systematically investigate the sleep-stage classification based on LFPs in subthalamic nucleus (STN). With our newly developed recording and transmission system, STN-LFPs were collected from 12 PD patients during wakefulness and nocturnal polysomnography sleep monitoring at one month after DBS implantation. Automatic sleep-stage classification models were built with robust and interpretable machine learning methods (support vector machine and decision tree). The accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity of the classification reached high values (above 90% at most measures) at group and individual levels. Features extracted in alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-35 Hz), and gamma (35-50 Hz) bands were found to contribute the most to the classification. These results will directly guide the engineering development of implantable sleep monitoring and closed-loop DBS and pave the way for a better understanding of the STN-LFP sleep patterns.

In this sense, electroencephalographic (EEG) methods offer promising alternatives due to their low cost, portability, and growing robustness. Here, we relied on EEG signals and a novel information-sharing method to study resting-state connectivity in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and controls. To evaluate the specificity of our results, we also tested Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The classification power of the ensuing connectivity patterns was evaluated through a supervised classification algorithm (support vector machine). In addition, we compared the classification power yielded by (i) functional connectivity, (ii) relevant neuropsychological tests, and (iii) a combination of both. BvFTD patients exhibited a specific pattern of hypoconnectivity in mid-range frontotemporal links, which showed no alterations in AD patients. These functional connectivity alterations in bvFTD were replicated with a low-density EEG setting (20 electrodes). Moreover, while neuropsychological tests yielded acceptable discrimination between bvFTD and controls, the addition of connectivity results improved classification power. Finally, classification between bvFTD and AD patients was better when based on connectivity than on neuropsychological measures. Taken together, such findings underscore the relevance of EEG measures as potential biomarker signatures for clinical settings.

Numerous studies have set up mock crime scenario to identify changes in EEG cognitive components. However, only two kinds of subjects are taken into account in most previous studies. Therefore, if an innocent person had been aware of case-related information, i.e., probe items, which is likely to happen in practice, recognition capability will be significantly compromised. In order to simulate practical cases, three kinds of subjects needed to be discriminated, including guilty, innocent and informed. 36 subjects went through a mock crime scenario, and EEG signals obtained on 8 electrodes were analyzed. After preprocessing, the discrete wavelet packet decomposition was used to extract EEG features. Subsequently, a multi-scale wavelet kernel extreme learning machine classifier is proposed to recognize the group to which a specific subject belongs. To further reduce computation, Cholesky decomposition is introduced during the calculation of the output weights. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve good recognition performance and has low computational burden.

We leverage deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image and signal understanding to facilitate both real-time object detection and dry-Electroencephalography (EEG) based human cortical brain bio-signals decoding. We employ recent advances in dry-EEG technology to stream and collect the cortical waveforms from subjects while they fixate on variable Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) stimuli generated directly from the environment the robot is navigating. To these ends, we propose the use of novel variable BCI stimuli by utilising the real-time video streamed via the on-board robot camera as visual input for SSVEP, where the CNN detected natural scene objects are altered and flickered with differing frequencies (10Hz, 12Hz and 15Hz). These stimuli are not akin to traditional stimuli as both the dimensions of the flicker regions and their on-screen position changes depending on the scene objects detected. Onscreen object selection via such a dry-EEG enabled SSVEP methodology, facilitates the on-line decoding of human cortical brain signals, via a specialised secondary CNN, directly into teleoperation robot commands (approach object, move in a specific direction: right, left or back). This SSVEP decoding model is trained via a priori offline experimental data in which very similar visual input is present for all subjects. The resulting classification demonstrates high performance with mean accuracy of 85% for the real-time robot navigation experiment across multiple test subjects.

Compared to the invasive neural signal based brain-machine interface (BMI), a non-invasive alternative, i.e., the electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BMI would be more widely accepted by the patients above. Ideally, a real-time continuous neuroprosthestic control is required for practical applications. However, conventional EEG-based BMIs mainly deal with the discrete brain activity classification. Until recently, the literature has reported several attempts for achieving the real-time continuous control by reconstructing the continuous movement parameters (e.g., speed, position, etc.) from the EEG recordings, and the low-frequency band EEG is consistently reported to encode the continuous motor control information. Previous studies with executed movement tasks have extensively relied on the amplitude representation of such slow oscillations of EEG signals for building models to decode kinematic parameters. Inspired by the recent successes of instantaneous phase of low-frequency invasive brain signals in the motor control and sensory processing domains, this study examines the extension of such a slow-oscillation phase representation to the reconstructing two-dimensional hand movements, with the non-invasive EEG signals for the first time. The data for analysis are collected on five healthy subjects performing 2D hand center-out reaching along four directions in two sessions. On representative channels over the cortices encoding the execution information of reaching movements, we show that the low-delta EEG phase representation is characterized by higher signal-to-noise ratio and stronger modulation by the movement tasks, compared to the low-delta EEG amplitude representation. Furthermore, we have tested the low-delta EEG phase representation with two commonly used linear decoding models. The results demonstrate that the low-delta EEG phase based decoders lead to superior performance for 2D executed movement reconstruction to its amplitude based counterparts, as well as the other-frequency band amplitude and power based features. Thus, our study contributes to improve the movement reconstruction from EEG by introducing a new feature set based on the low-delta EEG phase patterns, and demonstrates its potential for continuous fine motion control of neuroprostheses.

There is a tremendous interest in implementing BCIs on portable platforms, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) due to their low-cost, low-power and portability characteristics. This article presents the design and implementation of a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system based on motor imagery on a Virtex-6 FPGA. In order to design an accurate algorithm, the proposed method avails statistical learning methods such as Mutual Information (MI), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It also uses Separable Common Spatio Spectral Pattern (SCSSP) method in order to extract features. Simulation results prove achieved performances of 73.54% for BCI competition III-dataset V, 67.2% for BCI competition IV-dataset 2a with all four classes, 80.55% for BCI competition IV-dataset 2a with the first two classes, and 81.9% for captured signals. Moreover, the final reported hardware resources determine its efficiency as a result of using retiming and folding techniques from the VLSI architecture' perspective. The complete proposed BCI system achieves not only excellent recognition accuracy, but also remarkable implementation efficiency in terms of portability, power, time, and cost.

Automatic sleep classification using adaptive segmentation reveals an increased number of rapid eye movement sleep transitions	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						automatic classification; data-driven segmentation; electroencephalography; REM sleep stability; sleep stage switching	EEG SIGNALS; IDENTIFICATION; AGREEMENT	The reference standard for sleep classification uses manual scoring of polysomnography with fixed 30-s epochs. This limits the analysis of sleep pattern, structure and, consequently, detailed association with other physiologic processes. We aimed to improve the details of sleep evaluation by developing a data-driven method that objectively classifies sleep in smaller time intervals. Two adaptive segmentation methods using 3, 10 and 30-s windows were compared. One electroencephalographic (EEG) channel was used to segment into quasi-stationary segments and each segment was classified using a multinomial logistic regression model. Classification features described the power in the clinical frequency bands of three EEG channels and an electrooculographic (EOG) anticorrelation measure for each segment. The models were optimised using 19 healthy control subjects and validated on 18 healthy control subjects. The models obtained overall accuracies of 0.71 +/- 0.09, 0.74 +/- 0.09 and 0.76 +/- 0.08 on the validation data. However, the models allowed a more dynamic sleep, which challenged a true validation against manually scored hypnograms with fixed epochs. The automated classifications indicated an increased number of stage transitions and shorter sleep bouts using models with smaller window size compared with the hypnograms. An increased number of transitions from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was likewise expressed in the model using 30-s windows, indicating that REM sleep has more fluctuations than captured by today's standard. The models developed are generally applicable and may contribute to concise sleep structure evaluation, research in sleep control and improved understanding of sleep and sleep disorders. The models could also contribute to objective measuring of sleep stability.	[Koch, Henriette; Jennum, Poul; Christensen, Julie A.

This wheel chair would be helpful for disabled people who cannot move their hands and legs or basically suffering from cerebromedullospinal disconnection. The main objective is to map different facial expression to the movement of the wheelchair. Methods: The headset used for this purpose comprises of an EEG cap which has a total of 16 electrodes connected out of which 14 electrodes are used for acquiring data and the rest 2 are used as ground and reference. To operate the wheelchair the subject has to place the cap on his/her head and different facial expressions (clench, smile, blink, etc.) are performed. The movement of muscles around the face due to facial expressions can be observed from the EEG signals being recorded. Each expression is linked to movement of the wheelchair. Signal is preprocessed to remove the artifacts and then features are extracted using Fast Fourier Transform. In this paper, for classification we have used state-of-the-art machine learning technique which is a slight variation of Extreme Learning Machine called as Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine abbreviated as OS-ELM. Results: An overall accuracy of 97.62% was obtained using 10-fold cross validation. Conclusion: The proposed framework attains better classification accuracy compared to various other classifiers.

Furthermore, we argue that the network makes predictions on the grounds of differences in speech development. Previous work has explored taking 'deep' neural networks (DNNs) designed for, or trained with, images to classify encephalographic recordings with some success, but this does little to acknowledge the structure of these data. Simple neural networks have been used extensively to classify data expressed as features, but require extensive feature engineering and pre-processing. We present novel DNNs trained using raw magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings that mimic the feature-engineering pipeline. We highlight criteria the networks use, including relative weighting of channels and preferred spectro-temporal characteristics of re-weighted channels. Our data feature 92 subjects aged 4-18, recorded using a 151-channel MEG system. Our proposed model scores over 95% mean cross-validation accuracy distinguishing above and below 10 years of age in single trials of un-seen subjects, and can classify publicly available EEG with state-of-the-art accuracy.

However, despite the interest in EAT, few scientific studies have focused on understanding the complex emotional response that horses seem to elicit in human riders and handlers. In this work, the potential use of affect recognition techniques based on physiological signals is examined for the task of assessing the interaction between humans and horses in terms of the emotional response of the humans to this interaction. Electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) signals were captured from humans interacting with horses, and machine learning techniques were applied in order to predict the self-reported emotional states of the human subjects in terms of valence and arousal. Supervised classification experiments demonstrated the potential of this approach for affect recognition during human-horse interaction, reaching an F1-score of 78.27% for valence and 65.49% for arousal.

J	Huang, YR; Yang, JH; Liu, SY; Pan, JH				Huang, Yongrui; Yang, Jianhao; Liu, Siyu; Pan, Jiahui			Combining Facial Expressions and Electroencephalography to Enhance Emotion Recognition	FUTURE INTERNET			English	Article						emotion recognition; EEG; facial expressions; decision-level fusion; transfer learning	CLASSIFICATION; FUSION; EEG	Emotion recognition plays an essential role in human-computer interaction. Previous studies have investigated the use of facial expression and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from single modal for emotion recognition separately, but few have paid attention to a fusion between them. In this paper, we adopted a multimodal emotion recognition framework by combining facial expression and EEG, based on a valence-arousal emotional model. For facial expression detection, we followed a transfer learning approach for multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to detect the state of valence and arousal. For EEG detection, two learning targets (valence and arousal) were detected by different support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, separately. Finally, two decision-level fusion methods based on the enumerate weight rule or an adaptive boosting technique were used to combine facial expression and EEG. In the experiment, the subjects were instructed to watch clips designed to elicit an emotional response and then reported their emotional state. We used two emotion datasetsa Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) and MAHNOB-human computer interface (MAHNOB-HCI)to evaluate our method. In addition, we also performed an online experiment to make our method more robust. We experimentally demonstrated that our method produces state-of-the-art results in terms of binary valence/arousal classification, based on DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI data sets. Besides this, for the online experiment, we achieved 69.75% accuracy for the valence space and 70.00% accuracy for the arousal space after fusion, each of which has surpassed the highest performing single modality (69.28% for the valence space and 64.00% for the arousal space). The results suggest that the combination of facial expressions and EEG information for emotion recognition compensates for their defects as single information sources. The novelty of this work is as follows. To begin with, we combined facial expression and EEG to improve the performance of emotion recognition. Furthermore, we used transfer learning techniques to tackle the problem of lacking data and achieve higher accuracy for facial expression. Finally, in addition to implementing the widely used fusion method based on enumerating different weights between two models, we also explored a novel fusion method, applying boosting technique.

EEG signals are mainly used for the detection and visualization of many neurological disorders. It is also used for the diagnosis of epilepsy. Epilepsy is a chronic disease and 1% of the world's population is affected. Epilepsy results in seizures associated with loss of consciousness, including long-term loss of consciousness and affecting patient quality of life. It is possible to determine the detection of epilepsy from EEG data. However, there are some difficulty to detect epilepsy because of the length and complexity of EEG. There are many studies for the classification and detection of epilepsy. Most of these studies are realized with artificial neural networks and machine learning. In this study, epilepsy detection was performed by using machine learning over EEG data with the features obtained by time-frequency domain analysis during seizure. As a result of the study, Logistic Regression classifier gave the best training results for 23 different EEG channels and tested. In the test results; 87.5% accuracy, 75.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity values were obtained.

J	Bi, XJ; Wang, HB				Bi Xiaojun; Wang Haibo			Early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis based on EEG spectral images using deep learning	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Early diagnosis of AD; Multi-task learning; Deep learning; Deep Boltzmann Machine	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FEATURE-SELECTION; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION	Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a proceeding hot issue along with a sharp upward trend in the incidence rate. Recently, early diagnosis of AD employing Electroencephalogram (EEG) as a specific hallmark has been an increasingly significant hot topic area. In consideration of the limited size of available EEG spectral images, how to extract more abstract features for better generalization still remains tremendously troubling. In this paper, we demonstrate that it can be settled well with multi-task learning strategy based on discriminative convolutional high-order Boltzmann Machine with hybrid feature maps. First, differently from our original model - Contractive Slab and Spike Convolutional Deep Boltzmann Machine (CssCDBM), we directly conduct EEG spectral image classification via inducing label layer, resulting in a discriminative version of CssCDBM, referred to as DCssCDBM. This demonstrates DCssCDBM can be extended well into the classification model instead of feature extractor alone previously. Then, the most important approach innovation is that we train our DCssCDBM with multi-task learning framework via EEG spectral images based Identification and verification tasks for overfitting reduction for the first time, which could increase the inter-subject variations and reduce the intra-subject variations respectively, both of which are essential to early diagnosis of AD. The proposed method shows the better ability of high-level representations extraction and demonstrates the advanced results over several state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is used to sense the glitch in the brain due to the recurrent existence of the seizures known as epilepsy. The detection of epileptic seizures by human examination is time consuming and it results in misconception. Therefore in this paper an effective feature extraction method of local binary pattern (LBP) is introduced for the automatic identification of epilepsy to reduce the complexity of the human examination. The extracted features are classified by employing artificial neural network (ANN) classifier to discriminate non-focal and focal EEG signals. The epilepsy EEG dataset furnished by Bern- Barcelona contains 3750 pairs of EEG signals from non-focal and focal class used in this study. 10-fold cross validation is performed to evaluate the discrimination performance. The proposed method LBP with ANN classifier achieved a 93.21% of accuracy, 93.63% of specificity and sensitivity of 92.80%.	[Prasanna, J.; Sairamya, N.

The outcome of some of the studies had identified surface Electromyography (EMG) as the most commonly used biological signal in predicting the motion intention of an amputee. Different EMG based control methods for multifunctional prosthesis have been proposed and investigated in a number of previous studies. However, no any multifunctional prostheses are clinically available yet. One of the possible reasons would be that the residual muscles after amputations might not produce sufficient EMG signals for movement classifications. In this study, we proposed to use electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from the scalp of an amputee as additional signals for motion identifications. The performance of a hybrid scheme based on the combination of EMG and EEG signals in identifying different hand and wrist movements was evaluated in one transhumeral amputee. Our pilot results showed that the proposed hybrid method increased the classification accuracy in identifying different hand and wrist movements of the amputee. This suggests that the proposed method may have potential to improve the control of multifunctional prostheses.

The proliferation of dementia cases in aging societies creates a remarkable economic as well as medical problems in many communities worldwide. A recently published report by The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 47 million people are suffering from dementia-related neurocognitive declines worldwide. The number of dementia cases is predicted by 2050 to triple, which requires the creation of an AI-based technology application to support interventions with early screening for subsequent mental wellbeing checking as well as preservation with digital-pharma (the so-called beyond a pill) therapeutical approaches. We present an attempt and exploratory results of brain signal (EEG) classification to establish digital biomarkers for dementia stage elucidation. We discuss a comparison of various machine learning approaches for automatic event-related potentials (ERPs) classification of a high and low task-load sound stimulus recognition.

In this study we propose a zero-shot EEG-to-image brain decoding approach which makes use of state-of-the-art EEG preprocessing and feature selection methods, and which maps EEG activity to biologically inspired computer vision and linguistic models. We apply this approach to solve the problem of identifying viewed images from recorded brain activity in a reliable and scalable way. We demonstrate competitive decoding accuracies across two EEG datasets, using a zero-shot learning framework more applicable to real-world image retrieval than traditional classification techniques.

The loss of responsiveness is a critical event in the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Here we seek to understand the electrophysiological signatures that reflect the loss of capacity to respond to external stimuli during drowsiness using two complementary methods: spectral connectivity and EEG microstates. Furthermore, we integrate these two methods for the first time by investigating the connectivity patterns captured during individual microstate lifetimes. While participants performed an auditory semantic classification task, we allowed them to become drowsy and unresponsive. As they stopped responding to the stimuli, we report the breakdown of alpha networks and the emergence of theta connectivity. Further, we show that the temporal dynamics of all canonical EEG microstates slow down during unresponsiveness. We identify a specific microstate (D) whose occurrence and duration are prominently increased during this period. Employing machine learning, we show that the temporal properties of microstate D, particularly its prolonged duration, predicts the response likelihood to individual stimuli. Finally, we find a novel relationship between microstates and brain networks as we show that microstate D uniquely indexes significantly stronger theta connectivity during unresponsiveness. Our findings demonstrate that the transition to unconsciousness is not linear, but rather consists of an interplay between transient brain networks reflecting different degrees of sleep depth.

An auto-encoder neural network is a special network that can be trained in an unsupervised manner for automated feature learning. Unsupervised analysis of EEG signals is highly desirable since supervised analysis requires manual labeling of EEG signals which can be labor intensive and time consuming given the large amount of EEG data collected. We present a deep convolutional auto-encoder neural network to automatically learn feature representations from raw EEG signals in an unsupervised manner. We use the features extracted from the auto-encoder neural network for clustering EEG signals into sleep stages. For clustering, we test two algorithms: K-means -- which is a single-membership model, and the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model -- which is a mixed membership model. Results are presented demonstrating an improvement in clustering performance using auto-encoder features compared to standard manually extracted features.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) were employed to fMRI functional network classification only very recently and its application to EEG-based connectome is largely unexplored. We propose a DNN with deep belief network (DBN) architecture for automated classification of schizophrenia (SZ) based on EEG effective connectivity. We used vector-autoregression-based directed connectivity (DC), graph-theoretical complex network (CN) measures and combination of both as input features. On a large resting-state EEG dataset, we found a significant decrease in synchronization of neural oscillations measured by partial directed coherence, and a reduced network integration in terms of weighted degrees and transitivity in SZ compared to healthy controls. The proposed DNN-DBN significantly outperforms three other traditional classifiers, due to its inherent capability as feature extractor to learn hierarchical representations from the aberrant brain network structure. Combined DC-CN features gives further improvement over the raw DC and CN features alone, achieving remarkable classification accuracy of 95% for the theta and beta bands.

A currently intensively discussed approach to address these problems is individualized closed-loop stimulation. ConnectToBrain is a synergy project funded by the European Research Council to develop noninvasive closed-loop therapeutic stimulation of network disorders of the human brain. It consists of three main pillars: (1) development of a multichannel transcranial magnetic stimulation (mTMS) coil array that covers nearly all of the cerebral cortex and enables highly precise electronic control of location, direction, intensity and timing of the induced electrical fields, (2) development of real-time analysis of activity and connectivity in brain networks using electroencephalography (EEG) for instantaneous spatial and temporal control of stimulation (brain state-dependent, closed-loop stimulation) and adaptive optimization of treatment effects by machine learning and (3) translation of these neurotechnological innovations into physiological and clinical studies.

In former decades of BCI, machine learning classification algorithms serve this purpose. But in the recent picture of BCE, deep learning replaces the position of conventional machine learning algorithms. The research papers of BCI, where deep learning is used for the classification, claim to get better accuracy for the system compares to the use of machine learning. Though the machine learning classification algorithms are specifically designed for the purpose of classification, deep learning achieves better results by using a single layer of Softmax for the job of classification. The key behind this achievement of deep learning is its extracted features from several non-linear hidden layers. These features are far better for the task of classification than the handcrafted features used in the machine learning algorithms. In this work, we have analyzed the difference between these two different kinds of features with the support of clustering techniques.

However, the majority of the research reported in this field tends to focus on the accuracy of classification whilst neglecting the interpretability of emotion progression. In this paper, we propose a new interpretable emotion recognition approach with the activation mechanism by using machine learning and EEG signals. This paper innovatively proposes the emotional activation curve to demonstrate the activation process of emotions. The algorithm first extracts features from EEG signals and classifies emotions using machine learning techniques, in which different parts of a trial are used to train the proposed model and assess its impact on emotion recognition results. Second, novel activation curves of emotions are constructed based on the classification results, and two emotion coefficients, i.e., the correlation coefficients and entropy coefficients. The activation curve can not only classify emotions but also reveals to a certain extent the emotional activation mechanism. Finally, a weight coefficient is obtained from the two coefficients to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. To validate the proposed method, experiments have been carried out on the DEAP and SEED dataset. The results support the point that emotions are progressively activated throughout the experiment, and the weighting coefficients based on the correlation coefficient and the entropy coefficient can effectively improve the EEG-based emotion recognition accuracy.

With the development of classification algorithms, many traditional patterns based on low-level commands, such as the movement of hands, feet, tongue, or shoulders, can be decoded quite well. However, when encoded by low-level commands, each body part can perform only one imaginary command. This not only limits the number of tasks that a user's body can encode, but also makes the system less user-centered. In this paper, we proposed a novel pattern based on high-level commands for encoding MI BCI. This pattern combines clockwise and anticlockwise movements of both hands. Compared with a typical traditional pattern based on low-level commands, this pattern shows insignificant differences with regard to distinctiveness and stability for some of the tested subjects (p > 0.05). Thus, the proposed pattern can potentially allow additional tasks by human body without reducing their distinctiveness and stability. The results of this study also provide insights into the creation of high-level commands and improvements toward more intelligent and user-centered systems. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Eye movements explain decodability during perception and cued attention in MEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG; Decoding; Eye movements	EEG; RECOGNITION	Eye movements are an integral part of human perception, but can induce artifacts in many magneto-encephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies. For this reason, investigators try to minimize eye movements and remove these artifacts from their data using different techniques. When these artifacts are not purely random, but consistent regarding certain stimuli or conditions, the possibility arises that eye movements are actually inducing effects in the MEG signal. It remains unclear how much of an influence eye movements can have on observed effects in MEG, since most MEG studies lack a control analysis to verify whether an effect found in the MEG signal is induced by eye movements. Here, we find that we can decode stimulus location from eye movements in two different stages of a working memory match-to-sample task that encompass different areas of research typically done with MEG. This means that the observed MEG effect might be (partly) due to eye movements instead of any true neural correlate.

But EEG coherence has shown promising results in small samples. The overall aim was to evaluate if EEG connectivity markers can discriminate between Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy aging and to explore the early underlying changes in coherence. Methods: EEGs were included in the analysis from 135 healthy controls, 117 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 117 patients with Alzheimer's disease from six Nordic memory clinics. Principal component analysis was performed before multinomial regression. Results: We found classification accuracies of above 95% based on coherence, imaginary part of coherence, and the weighted phase-lag index. The most prominent changes in coherence were decreased alpha coherence in Alzheimer's disease, which was correlated to the scores of the 10-word test in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease battery. Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracies for EEG connectivity measures are higher than findings from studies investigating EEG power and conventional Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. Furthermore, decreased alpha coherence is one of the earliest changes in Alzheimer's disease and associated with memory function. Significance: EEG connectivity measures may be useful supplementary diagnostic classifiers. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It provides important information related to brain diseases, injuries, and high level cognitive functions. Statistical methods have been widely used to model brain functional connectivity based upon which insights of brain function are expected to be revealed. Most statistical approaches were developed based upon an assumption that connectivity patterns are static during the recording. This is not true because the connectivity changes over time. A dynamical modeling of connectivity patterns allows to characterize these variations. In this work, a simplified dynamic Bayesian modeling approach, parallel Hidden Markov Model (PaHMM), was investigated by characterizing temporal variations of cortical functional connectivity patterns computed using epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The performance of the PaHMM was evaluated based on an experimental study of epilepsy detection and classification, where multisubject epileptic EEG data from Temple University Hospital EEG Data Corpus were used. Experimental results show that an accuracy of 93.5% was obtained for the epilepsy detection, and an overall accuracy above 81% was achieved for the seizure type classification. This indicates that the method can efficiently capture temporal variations of functional connectivity patterns, and is potentially applicable in clinical settings to detect epilepsy and differentiate seizure types.

METHODS The authors retrospectively studied the medical records of all patients who had presented with medically intractable ESs and had undergone surgery in the period between October 2009 and August 2015. The interictal electroencephalography (EEG) pattern, MRI studies, magnetoencephalography findings, and postsurgical seizure outcomes were compared. RESULTS Twenty-six patients, 12 boys and 14 girls (age range 3-22 years), were eligible for study inclusion. Of these 26 patients, 84.6% (22) presented with multiple seizure types including partial seizures (PSs) independent of the ESs (30.8%); ESs followed by tonic seizures (30.8%); myoclonic seizures (19.2%); tonic seizures (19.2%); ESs followed by PSs (19.2%); focal seizures with secondary generalization (15.4%); atypical absence (11.5%); PSs followed by ESs (7.7%); and myoclonic followed by tonic seizures (7.7%). Seventeen patients underwent multilobar resection and 9 underwent unilobar resection. At the last follow-up (mean 36.6 months), 42.3% of patients were seizure free (outcome classification [OC] 1), 23.1% had > 50% reduction in seizure frequency (OC2-OC4), and 34.6% had < 50% reduction in seizure frequency or no improvement (OC5 and OC6). Predictors of favorable outcomes included an interictal focal EEG pattern and concordance between interictal EEG and MRI-demonstrated lesions (p = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS A favorable surgical outcome is achievable in a highly select group of patients with ESs secondary to structural lesions. Interictal EEG can help in identifying patients with the potential for favorable resective outcomes.

A Dementia Classification Framework Using Frequency and Time-Frequency Features Based on EEG Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Alzheimer's disease; machine learning; K-nearest neighbor; signal processing	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; CRITERIA	Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 60%-70% of all dementia cases, and clinical diagnosis at its early stage is extremely difficult. As several new drugs aiming to modify disease progression or alleviate symptoms are being developed, to assess their efficacy, novel robust biomarkers of brain function are urgently required. This paper aims to explore a routine to gain such biomarkers using the quantitative analysis of electroencephalography (QEEG). This paper proposes a supervised classification framework that uses EEG signals to classify healthy controls (HC) and AD participants. The framework consists of data augmentation, feature extraction, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification, quantitative evaluation, and topographic visualization. Considering the human brain either as a stationary or a dynamical system, both the frequency-based and time-frequency-based features were tested in 40 participants. The results show that: 1) the proposed method can achieve up to a 99% classification accuracy on short (4s) eyes open EEG epochs, with the KNN algorithm that has best performance when compared with alternative machine learning approaches; 2) the features extracted using the wavelet transform produced better classification performance in comparison to the features based on FFT; and 3) in the spatial domain, the temporal and parietal areas offer the best distinction between healthy controls and AD. The proposed framework can effectively classify HC and AD participants with high accuracy, meanwhile offering identification and the localization of significant QEEG features. These important findings and the proposed classification framework could be used for the development of a biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in AD.

In this work, we address the problem of EEG-based decoding of auditory attention to a target instrument in realistic polyphonic music. To this end, we exploit a stimulus reconstruction model which was proven to decode successfully the attention to speech in multi-speaker environments. To our knowledge, this model was never applied to musical stimuli for decoding attention. The task we consider here is quite complex as the stimuli used are polyphonic, including duets and trios, and are reproduced using loudspeakers instead of headphones. We consider the decoding of three different audio representations and investigate the influence on the decoding performance of multiple variants of musical stimuli, such as the number and type of instruments in the mixture, the spatial rendering, the music genre and the melody/rhythmical pattern that is played. We obtain promising results, comparable to those obtained on speech data in previous works, and confirm that it is possible to correlate the human brain activity with musically relevant features of the attended source.

Space-time recurrences for functional connectivity evaluation and feature extraction in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Functional connectivity; Recurrence quantification; Recurrence networks; Complex networks; Motor imagery; Pattern recognition	EEG; NETWORKS; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY; SYNCHRONIZATION; CORRENTROPY; GRAPHS	This work presents a classification performance comparison between different frameworks for functional connectivity evaluation and complex network feature extraction aiming to distinguish motor imagery classes in electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The analysis was performed in two online datasets: (1) a classical benchmark-the BCI competition IV dataset 2a-allowing a comparison with a representative set of strategies previously employed in this BCI paradigm and (2) a statistically representative dataset for signal processing technique comparisons over 52 subjects. Besides exploring three classical similarity measures-Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and mean phase coherence-this work also proposes a recurrence-based alternative for estimating EEG brain functional connectivity, which takes into account the recurrence density between pairwise electrodes over a time window. These strategies were followed by graph feature evaluation considering clustering coefficient, degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. The features were selected by Fisher's discriminating ratio and classification was performed by a least squares classifier in agreement with classical and online BCI processing strategies. The results revealed that the recurrence-based approach for functional connectivity evaluation was significantly better than the other frameworks, which is probably associated with the use of higher order statistics underlying the electrode joint probability estimation and a higher capability of capturing nonlinear inter-relations. There were no significant differences in performance among the evaluated graph features, but the eigenvector centrality was the best feature regarding processing time. Finally, the best ranked graph-based attributes were found in classical EEG motor cortex positions for the subjects with best performances, relating functional organization and motor activity.

J	Li, LL; Xu, GH; Xie, J; Li, M				Li, Lili; Xu, Guanghua; Xie, Jun; Li, Min			Classification of single-trial motor imagery EEG by complexity regularization	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Motor imagery; Single-trial EEG; Brain computer interface; Complexity	OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; FILTERS	Brain computer interface based on electroencephalogram is a popular way to enable communication between brain and output devices helping elderly and disabled people and in rehabilitation. In practice, the effectiveness of brain computer interface has a strong relationship with the classification accuracy of single trials. Common spatial pattern is believed to be an effective algorithm for classifying the single-trial brain signal. Since it is based on the characteristics of a broad frequency band which is manually selected and not individual variability, it is sensitive to noise and individual variability. In this paper, the common spatial pattern was extended in order to improve classification accuracies and to mitigate these influences. The channel-specific complexity weights of characteristic on montage were derived and added to improve the effects of the relevant function area and the separability between classes. The proposed method was evaluated using two public datasets, and achieved an average accuracy of 18.4% higher than conventional common spatial pattern, and the performance of the proposed method over conventional common spatial pattern was significant (p<0.05). It indicates that the proposed method extracts subject-specific characteristics and outperforms the conventional common spatial pattern in single-trial EEG classification.

J	Jiang, ZB; Chung, FL; Wang, ST				Jiang, Zhibin; Chung, Fu-Lai; Wang, Shitong			Recognition of Multiclass Epileptic EEG Signals Based on Knowledge and Label Space Inductive Transfer	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Multiclass; epileptic EEG signal recognition; LSR; inductive transfer learning; knowledge and label space transfer	SEIZURE PREDICTION; REGRESSION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recognition based on machine learning models is becoming more and more attractive in epilepsy detection. For multiclass epileptic EEG signal recognition tasks including the detection of epileptic EEG signals from different blends of different background data and epilepsy EEG data and the classification of different types of seizures, we may perhaps encounter two serious challenges: (1) a large amount of EEG signal data for training are not available and (2) the models for epileptic EEG signal recognition are often so complicated that they are not as easy to explain as a linear model. In this paper, we utilize the proposed transfer learning technique to circumvent the first challenge and then design a novel linear model to circumvent the second challenge. Concretely, we originally combine gamma-LSR with transfer learning to propose a novel knowledge and label space inductive transfer learning model for multiclass EEG signal recognition. By transferring both knowledge and the proposed generalized label space from the source domain to the target domain, the proposed model achieves enhanced classification performance on the target domain without the use of kernel trick. In contrast to the other inductive transfer learning methods, the method uses the generalized linear model such that it becomes simpler and more interpretable. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method for multiclass epileptic EEG signal recognition.

In current studies, an accurate measure of the level of human attention is one of the key issues that arouse much interest. This paper proposes a novel optimized complex network method (OCNM) for measuring an individual's attention level using single-electrode electroencephalography (EEG) signals. A time-delay embedding algorithm was used to reconstruct EEG data epochs into nodes of the OCNM network. Euclidean distances were calculated between each two nodes to decide edges of the network. Three key parameters influencing OCNM, i.e., delaying time, embedding dimension, and connection threshold, were optimized for each individual. The average degree and clustering coefficient of the constructed network were extracted as a feature vector and were classified into two patterns of concentration and relaxation using an LDA classifier. In the offline experiments of six subjects, the classification performance was tested and compared with an attention meter method (AMM) and an ++++R method. The experimental results showed that the proposed OCNM achieved the highest accuracy rate (80.67% versus 70.58% and 68.88%). This suggests that the proposed method can potentially be used for EEG-based neurofeedback systems with a single electrode.

In this work, we hypothesize there exists default brain variables across subjects in emotional processes. Hence, the states of the latent variables that related to emotional processing must contribute to building robust recognition models. We propose to utilize variational autoencoder (VAE) to determine the latent factors from the multi-channel EEG. Through sequence modeling method, we examine the emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public datasets (DEAP and SEED), and compared with traditional matrix factorization based (ICA) and autoencoder based (AE) approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that neural network is suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling and our proposed emotion recognition framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance. As far as we know, it is the first work that introduces VAE into multichannel EEG decoding for emotion recognition.

Absence epileptic seizures are neurological disorders which are manifested as abnormal EEG patterns. Matching pursuit algorithm is able to decompose a signal into components with specific time-frequency characteristics. It is a robust technique especially when there is complex, multicomponent signal. In the present study, a clinical dataset containing 40 annotated absence seizures in long-term EEG recordings from pediatric epileptic patients (with age 6.0 +/- 2.9 years) was analyzed. The extracted MP features fed an automatic classification schema which achieved a time window based discrimination accuracy of 98.5%. As indicated by the study's results, the proposed features and analysis methods can be a promising addition to the area of automatic absence seizures detection.

The article presents a comparative study addressing the problem of neural feature classification in asynchronous multi-limb ECoG-driven BCIs. Several conventional classifiers often reported in the BCI literature were coupled with two preprocessing techniques and with a conventional feature extraction approach. They were compared to artificial neural network (ANN) end-to-end classifiers which mimic conventional BCI signal processing pipelines. Different initializations of ANNs were particularly studied. The comparison study was carried out using publicly available datasets (BCI competition IV).

Methods: We collected 64-channel high density electroencephalography (hdEEG) data from 5 individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia (2 female/3 male, median age: 54 years) during naming of 80 concrete images. We applied machine learning on continuous wavelet transformed hdEEG data separately for alpha and beta energy bands (200 ms pre-stimulus to 1500 ms post-stimulus, but before articulation), and determined whether electrode/time-range/energy (ETE) combinations were predictive of correct vs incorrect responses for each participant. Results: The five participants correctly named between 30% and 70% of the 80 stimuli correctly. We observed that pre-articulatory scalp EEG ETE combinations could predict correct vs incorrect responses with accuracies ranging from 63% to 80%. For all but one participant, the prediction accuracies were statistically better than chance. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that pre-articulatory neural activity may be used to predict correct vs incorrect naming responses for some individuals with aphasia. Significance: The individualized pre-articulatory neural pattern associated with correct naming responses could be used to both predict naming problems in aphasia and lead to the development of brain stimulation strategies for treatment.

Research in this field has typically applied data to training algorithms on a within-subject basis. However, even within-subject training and test data are not always of the same feature space and distribution. Such scenarios can contribute to poor BCI performance, and real-world applications for imagined speech-based BCIs cannot assume homogeneity in user data. Transfer Learning (TL) is a common approach used to improve generalizability in machine learning models through transfer of knowledge from a source domain to a target task. In this study, two distinct TL methodologies are employed to classify EEG data corresponding to imagined speech production of vowels, using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Both TL approaches involved conditional training of the CNN on all subjects, excluding the target subject. A subset of the target subject data was then used to fine- tune either the input or output layers of the CNN. Results were compared with a standard benchmark using a within-subject approach. Both TL methods significantly outperformed the baseline and fine-tuning of the input layers resulted in the highest overall accuracy (35.68%; chance: 20%).

Individualized pattern recognition for detecting mind wandering from EEG during live lectures	PLOS ONE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; BRAINS DEFAULT NETWORK; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; META-AWARENESS; ATTENTION; ALPHA; FMRI; PERFORMANCE; THOUGHT	Neural correlates of mind wandering The ability to detect mind wandering as it occurs is an important step towards improving our understanding of this phenomenon and studying its effects on learning and performance. Current detection methods typically rely on observable behaviour in laboratory settings, which do not capture the underlying neural processes and may not translate well into real-world settings. We address both of these issues by recording electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneously from 15 participants during live lectures on research in orthopedic surgery. We performed traditional group-level analysis and found neural correlates of mind wandering during live lectures that are similar to those found in some laboratory studies, including a decrease in occipitoparietal alpha power and frontal, temporal, and occipital beta power. However, individual-level analysis of these same data revealed that patterns of brain activity associated with mind wandering were more broadly distributed and highly individualized than revealed in the group-level analysis. Mind wandering detection To apply these findings to mind wandering detection, we used a data-driven method known as common spatial patterns to discover scalp topologies for each individual that reflects their differences in brain activity when mind wandering versus attending to lectures. This approach avoids reliance on known neural correlates primarily established through group-level statistics. Using this method for individual-level machine learning of mind wandering from EEG, we were able to achieve an average detection accuracy of 80-83%. Conclusions Modelling mind wandering at the individual level may reveal important details about its neural correlates that are not reflected when using traditional observational and statistical methods. Using machine learning techniques for this purpose can provide new insight into the varieties of neural activity involved in mind wandering, while also enabling real-time detection of mind wandering in naturalistic settings.

Multiple channels of EEG signals are recorded through the electrodes and are widely used in applications such as neurological disease diagnosis, emotion recognition, and behavior modeling. Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to classify EEG signals, where the different EEG channels are almost treated as a 2D grid input to the machine learning model. This data formation doesn't consider The complex connection among the EEG channels is not considered in such data formation. In our work, we treat EEG signals as frames of graph, and propose an end-to-end edge-aware spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural network for EEG classification. Specifically, we iteratively apply graph convolutional layer spatially and standard convolutional layer temporally. Since there is no prior knowledge about the exact connection among EEG channels, in our model, we initialize the connection as complete graph and apply learnable mask to capture graph structure at different levels. Furthermore, we also propose an iterative method based on information aggregation in graph convolution mechanism to reveal the latent graph structure. Empirical evaluation shows that our model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for EEG classification, and the learnt and revealed latent EEG graph structure is verified to be meaningful by neuroscientists.

A semisupervised deep stacking network with an adaptive learning rate strategy (SADSN) is proposed to solve the sample loss caused by supervised learning of EEG data and the extraction of manual features. The SADSN adopts the idea of an adaptive learning rate into a contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm to accelerate its convergence. Prior knowledge is introduced into the intermediary layer of the deep stacking network, and a restricted Boltzmann machine is trained by a semisupervised method in which the adjusting scope of the coefficient in learning rate is determined by performance analysis. Several EEG data sets are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the recognition accuracy of SADSN is advanced with a more significant convergence rate and successfully classifies motor imagery.

Approximately 50 million persons currently live with epilepsy globally. Closely 80% of the Persons with Epilepsy (PWE) living in little- and middle-income countries. Analysis of epilepsy lies on the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals through the various behavior of brain disorders. Localizing the seizure points is generally is tedious and time consuming. Therefore one often to acquire and analyze ten or even hundred hours of recordings. Alternative method is to predict the seizure before they occur and allow the patients to take appropriate care. In this paper, EEG signal is decomposed into coefficients by Wavelet transform. Second, state space reconstrunction method is used to derive phase space trajectory by converting time space signal to phase space. Finally, the classification performance is associated by accrucay and training time with fuzzy system and extreme learning machine (ELM) in neural system. The comparative experimental results using publically available data and real time data are comprised to display the efficiency of the suggested work towards the examination of seizure gestures. The novelty of this paper includes the analysis, detection and discrimination of seizure events.	[Kumar, S. T.

In this work, we have performed signal smoothing to fix unregulated electroencephalogram (EEG) fluctuations and to effectively collect hidden patterns in corresponding EEG spectra. To do it, we have applied a Savitzky Golay function because of its ability to preserve spectral properties without distorting it much. For feature selection, we have applied the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm with the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). FBCSP creates 11352 features from EEG signals and PCA gradually reduces the features to 185 most significant features. These features are utilized in the classification process by the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with suitable node split criteria to manage optimal tree height. A five-fold cross-validation approach concludes the superior performance of XGBoost in terms of minimizing execution time (3.7 times faster in the training phase) and providing improved accuracy as compared to existing results. Our approach enhances classification accuracy (88.80%) by approximately 10% over regularized common spatial patterns (78.01% accuracy), 15% over shift variance approximation (73.84% accuracy) and 15% over Riemannian approach (74.77% accuracy). It also concludes that the pre-consideration of the noise level in EEG spectra provides a better approximation.

Less has been investigated on the lower-limbs, due to its somatotopic arrangement in the sensorimotor cortex compared to that of upper limbs. Hip, knee, foot and toes share spatial proximity with each other. We therefore investigated the possibility to deploy the left vs. right knee extension kinaesthetic motor imagery (KMI) as a cognitive task in a BCI for the control of lower-limbs, primarily for people with neurodegenerative disorders, spinal cord injury or lower-limb amputation. The method involved feature extraction using common spatial pattern (CSP), and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm for the optimization of individual spatial patterns. This was followed by supervised machine learning using logistic regression (Logreg) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification of tasks. The paradigms resulted in four combinations/methods for discriminating between left and right knee tasks. The FBCSP-Logreg outperformed remaining paradigms with a maximum accuracy of 70.00% +/- 2.85 and kappa=0.40. The results elicit the possibility to deploy left vs. right knee extension KMI in a 2-class BCI for controlling robotic/prosthetic knee. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we investigate the complementary representation properties of EEG and eye movement signals on classification for five human emotions: happy, sad, fear, disgust, and neutral. We compare the performance of single modality and two different modality fusion approaches. The results indicate that EEG is superior to eye movements in classifying happy, sad and disgust emotions, whereas eye movements outperform EEG in recognizing fear and neutral emotions. Compared with eye movements, EEG has the advantage of classifying the five emotions, with the mean accuracies of 69.50% and 59.81%, respectively. Due to the complementary representation properties, the modality fusion with bimodal deep auto-encoder significantly improves the classification accuracy to 79.71%. Furthermore, we study the neural patterns of five emotion states and the recognition performance of different eye movement features. The results reveal that five emotions have distinguishable neural patterns and pupil diameter has a relatively high discrimination ability than the other eye movement features.

In this paper, an extensive analysis of the approach based on the classification of depression using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is carried out. A computer-aided machine learning approach: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning method is used in this work. The deep CNN was trained using EEG signals from 30 normal and 30 depressed persons. The network attained the highest accuracy of 99.31% in classifying depression from EEG signals of normal controls recorded from the right hemisphere of the brain and 96.3% from the left hemisphere of the brain after ten-fold cross-validation. The performance of the CNN network was evaluated by evaluating the classification accuracy, varying different parameters such as the number of strides, learning rate parameter, number of epochs, and sample size. An extensive data learning approach is proposed to classify depression EEG signals from that of healthy controls. The key advantage of using deep learning is that they return state-of-the-art accuracy and do not require manual pre-processing or feature extraction from the signal.

Spherical image QoE approximations for vision augmentation scenarios	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Augmented reality; Quality of experience; Image quality; Quality of service; Electroencephalography	QUALITY ASSESSMENT; COGNITIVE LOAD; VIDEO; EXPERIENCE; SYSTEMS	Augmented Reality (AR) devices are commonly head-worn to overlay context-dependent information into the field of view of the device operators. One particular scenario is the overlay of still images, for which we evaluate the interplay of user ratings as Quality of Experience (QoE) with (i) the non-referential BRISQUE objective image quality metric as Quality of Service (QoS) and (ii) human subject dry electrode EEG signals gathered with a commercial off-the-shelf device. We employ basic machine learning approaches to perform QoE and QoS predictions based on this data. We find strong correlations for QoS inputs with aggregated user ratings as Mean Opinion Scores with spherical images. For subject-specific EEG portfolios, overall predictability of the QoE for both media types can be attained. Our overall results can be employed in practical scenarios by content and network service providers to optimize the user experience in augmented reality scenarios with a passive human in-the-loop in the future.

The amount of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal data required for sleep-stage classification can be significantly reduced by applying CS at the cost of distortion in the reconstructed EEG signal. A neural network trained on features extracted from the reconstructed EEG signal was implemented as a classifier to avoid compromising the accuracy of classification in the presence of distortion in the reconstructed EEG signal. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network that uses a simple Manhattan distance function instead of complicated computation, such as vector multiplication matrix (VMM), was selected to reduce the hardware complexity. A classification method that utilizes information from the previous sleep stage based on the unique nature of human sleep was also presented and implemented on the proposed RBF classifier for further improvement of the classification accuracy. The classification system has been evaluated using EEG data from eight subjects in the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) sleep dataset. The measurement results showed that the classification system achieved high classification accuracy comparable to the previously reported sleep-stage classifiers that do not utilize signal compression.

This article presents some of the benefits of using psycho-physiological data in analyzing consumer valuation and choice. Eye-tracking, facial expressions, and electroencephalography (EEG) data were used to construct three non-conventional choice models, namely, eye-tracking, emotion and brain model. The predictive performance of the non-conventional models was compared to a baseline model, which was based entirely on conventional data. While the emotion and brain models proved to be as good as conventional data in explaining and predicting consumer choice, the eye-tracking model generated superior predictions. Moreover, we document a significant increase in predictive power when biometric data from different sources were combined into a mixed model. Finally, we utilize a machine learning technique to sparse the data and enhance out-of-sample prediction, thus showcasing the compatibility of biometric data with well-established statistical and econometric methods.

In particular, we investigated the spatiotemporal properties of brain state switches under cognition. The lack of electroencephalography stationarity is exploited as one of the signatures of the metastability of brain states. We correlated power law exponents in the variables that we proposed to describe brain states, and dynamical properties of non-stationarities with cognitive conditions. This framework was successfully tested with three different datasets: a working memory dataset, an Alzheimer disease dataset, and an emotions dataset. We discuss the temporal organization of switches between states, providing evidence suggesting the need to reconsider the piecewise model, in which switches appear at discrete times. Instead, we propose a more dynamically rich view, in which besides the seemingly discrete switches, switches between neighbouring states occur all the time. These micro switches are not (physical) noise, as their properties are also affected by cognition.

However, the differences between these connectivity methods, especially at the source level, have not yet been systematically studied. The dynamic characterization of coherent sources and temporal partial directed coherence, as measures of functional and effective connectivity, were applied to multimodal resting EEG and MEG data obtained from 11 young patients (mean age 13.2 +/- 1.5 years) with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and age-matched healthy subjects. Additionally, machine-learning algorithms were applied to the extracted connectivity features to identify biomarkers differentiating the two groups. An altered thalamo-cortical connectivity profile was attested in patients with ADHD who showed solely information outflow from cortical regions in comparison to healthy controls who exhibited bidirectional interregional connectivity in alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands. We achieved an accuracy of 98% by combining features from all five studied frequency bands. Our findings suggest that both types of connectivity as extracted from EEG or MEG are sensitive methods to investigate neuronal network features in neuropsychiatric disorders. The connectivity features investigated here can be further tested as biomarkers of ADHD.

J	Tuncer, T; Dogan, S; Akbal, E				Tuncer, Turker; Dogan, Sengul; Akbal, Erhan			A novel local senary pattern based epilepsy diagnosis system using EEG signals	AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Local senary pattern; EEG; Epilepsy diagnosis; Feature extraction	NEURAL-NETWORK; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SEIZURE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM; ENTROPIES	Epilepsy is a critical and widely seen neurological disorder for people and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used to diagnose epilepsy. To accurately diagnose epilepsy, distinctive features of the EEG signals should be extracted. Therefore, a novel texture descriptor is presented for distinctive feature extraction in this study and an EEG recognition method is proposed. The proposed method consists of four main phases. These are feature extraction, feature concatenation, feature reduction and classification. Firstly, the EEG signal is divided into 1 x 25 size of overlapping blocks and these blocks are converted to 2 dimensional blocks with size of 5 x 5. Because, the proposed novel local senary pattern (LSP) uses 5 x 5 size of blocks for feature extraction. 1536 Features are extracted using the proposed LSP. The proposed LSP is used ternary function to extract features and as we know that the main problem of the ternary function is to find optimal threshold value. Therefore, we used 10 threshold values by using standard deviation function and 1536 x 10 = 15,360 features are extracted from an EEG signal. In the feature combining phase, these features are concatenated. In order to reduce these features, a neighborhood component analysis based feature reduction method is used. In the classification phase support vector machine, k nearest neighborhood, quadratic discriminant analysis and linear discriminant analysis are utilized as the classifiers. To test success of the proposed method, the widely used EEG signals dataset which is Bonn University EEG database is used and 7 cases are defined for testing using this database and the proposed method achieved 93.0% classification accuracy for 5 classes case. The obtained results and comparisons clearly indicated success of the proposed LSP based method.

However, achieving high classification accuracy in a multi-subject multitask scenario is a challenge. A noticeable reduction in accuracy is observed when the subjects between train and test are mismatched. Drawing a similarity from speaker adaptation approaches in speech, we propose a method to perform subject-wise adaptation of EEG in order to improve the task classification performance. A Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) approach is employed for feature extraction. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based subject-specific models are built for each of the tasks. Maximum a-posterior (MAP) adaptation is performed, and an absolute improvement of 1.22-7.26% is observed in the average accuracy.

Motion sickness caused by such HMD use is detrimental, resulting in decreased task performance or total user dropout. The genesis of sickness symptoms is often measured using paper surveys, which are difficult to deploy in live scenarios. Here, we demonstrate a new way to track sickness severity using machine learning on data collected from heterogeneous, non-invasive sensors worn by users who navigated a virtual environment while remaining stationary in reality. We discovered that two models, one trained on heterogeneous sensor data and another trained only on electroencephalography ( EEG) data, were able to classify sickness severity with over 95% accuracy and were statistically comparable in performance. Greedy feature optimization was used to maximize accuracy while minimizing the feature subspace. We found that across models, the features with the most weight were previously reported in the literature as being related to motion sickness severity. Finally, we discuss how models constructed on heterogeneous vs homogeneous sensor data may be useful in different real-world scenarios.

Methods: Seventy-five epilepsy surgery candidates undergoing video-EEG monitoring were included. The patients wore one three-axis accelerometer on each wrist during video-EEG. The accelerometer data was band-pass filtered and reduced using a movement threshold and mapped to a time-frequency feature space representation. Algorithms based on standard binary classifiers combined with a TCS specific event detection layer were developed and trained using the training set. Their performance was evaluated in terms of sensitivity and false positive (FP) rate using the test set. Results: Thirty-seven available TCSs in 11 patients were recorded and the data was divided into disjoint training (27 TCSs, three patients) and test (10 TCSs, eight patients) data sets. The classification algorithms evaluated were K-nearest-neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF) and a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM). For the TCSs detection performance of the three algorithms in the test set, the highest sensitivity was obtained for KNN (100% sensitivity, 0.05 FP/h) and the lowest FP rate was obtained for RF (90% sensitivity, 0.01 FP/h). Conclusions: The low FP rate enhances the clinical utility of the detection system for long-term reliable seizure monitoring.

In this work, we invited twelve participants who were asked to play testing games for ensuing paying visual attention or to take a rest for a relaxed state. The brainwaves of participants were recorded by an EEG monitor during the experiments. EEG signals were transferred from time-domain into frequency-domain signals by fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the frequency distributions of brainwaves of different visual attention states. The frequency information was then inputted into a probabilistic neural network (PNN) to build a discrimination model and to learn the rules that could determine an EEG epoch belongs to paying attention or not. As a type of supervised feedforward neural networks, PNN benefits high training speed and good error tolerance which is suitable for instant classification tasks. Given a set of training samples, PNN can train the predictable model of the specific EEG features by supervised learning algorithm, performing a classifier for visual attentiveness. In this paper, the proposed method successfully offers efficient differentiation for the assessment of visual attentiveness using FFT and PNN. The predictive model can distinguish the EEG epoch with attentive or relaxed states, which has an average accuracy higher than 82% for twelve participants. This attention classifier is expected to aid smart lighting control, specifically in assessing how different lighting situations will influence users' visual work concentration.

Among others, emotional state is one of the conditions that could be of interest to doctors or caregivers. This paper discusses a preliminary study to develop a wearable device that is a low cost, single channel, dry contact, in-ear EEG suitable for non-intrusive monitoring. All aspects of the designs, engineering, and experimenting by applying machine learning for emotion classification, are covered. Based on the valence and arousal emotion model, the device is able to classify basic emotion with 71.07% accuracy (valence), 72.89% accuracy (arousal), and 53.72% (all four emotions). The results are comparable to those measured from the more conventional EEG headsets at T7 and T8 scalp positions. These results, together with its earphone-like wearability, suggest its potential usage especially for future healthcare applications, such as home-based or tele-monitoring systems as intended.

A standard sleep stage determination requires Electroencephalography (EEG) signals during the expensive and labor-intensive Polysomnography (PSG) test. To overcome this inconvenience, cardiorespiratory signals are proposed for the same purpose because of the easy and comfortable acquisition by simplified devices. In this paper, we leverage our low-cost wearable multi-sensor system to acquire the cardiorespiratory signals from subjects. Three novel features are designed during the feature extraction. We then apply a Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network architecture with Long Short-term Memory (BLSTM) to predict the four-class sleep stages. Our prediction accuracy is 80.25% on a large public dataset (417 subjects), and 80.75% on our 32 enrolled subjects, respectively. Our results outperform the previous works which either used small data sets and had the potential over-fitting issues, or used the conventional machine learning methods on large data sets.

Eigenspace Time Frequency Based Features for Accurate Seizure Detection from EEG Data	IRBM			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); EEG signals classification; Time frequency analysis; Singular value decomposition; Seizure detection; Machine leaming based classifiers	WAVELET TRANSFORM; ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; PATTERNS	Background: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects over 2% of the world population. Epilepsy patients suffer from recurring seizures that can be very harmful. The unpredictability of seizures is a major concern for medical practitioners because uncontrollable seizures can lead to sudden death and morbidity. A system that could warn patients and doctors alike about the impending seizure event would dramatically enhance the quality of life for patients. Methods: While most previous research works focused on using signal processing tools appropriate for stationary signals, we propose here to use time and frequency (TF) analysis to extract features capable of discriminating normal from abnormal EEG traces (both ictal and interictal). The features are extracted using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the EEG signal Time Frequency matrix. The left singular vectors of the time frequency matrix are used to obtain robust feature vectors. In contrast to existing techniques, the proposed TF-based technique can be used to detect the specific moments of seizure occurrences in time so that this information is used to discriminate interictal from ictal EEG traces. Instead of extracting the features directly from the TF matrix, we transform the left eigenvectors obtained from the SVD of the TF matrix into a feature vector that behaves like to a probability density function. Results: We show that almost all classical classification techniques achieve excellent seizure detection results when used with the proposed TF features, irrespective of the classifier used. Contrary to existing works, we test our approach across several real-life scenarios covering 2, 3, and 5 possible classes of data. Our tests provided consistent results across different scenarios. The results, under different scenarios, outperformed existing ones achieving consistently more than 97.3% and up to 99.5% in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Conclusion: Experimental results show that the novel features have successfully represented the characteristics of the underlying disease phenomenon from EEG data. Also, we conclude that learning based classifiers are better suited for this application, compared to Bayesian classifiers that have difficulty in adapting to the varying nature of the features' probability distribution function.

The novelty of the present research is to include phase information with amplitude of the EEG signals to differentiate class boundaries. A new formulation of CSP is introduced and solved using Lagrange's multiplier method taking phase information of EEG into account. In addition, the proposed CSP is also realized with Schur Decomposition technique instead of using the conventional eigenvalue decomposition to overcome the disadvantage of using the latter one. Experiments undertaken confirm that the proposed phase-sensitive CSP and the CSP with Schur decomposition yield better performance than their non-phase sensitive counterpart by a large margin with respect to classification accuracy with the best results obtained by former CSP algorithm.

The main objective was that the BCI should be able to recognize brain activity. BCI is an emerging technology which focuses on communication between software and hardware and permitting the use of brain activity to control electronic devices, such as wheelchairs, computers and robots. The interface was developed, and consists of EEG Bitronics, Arduino and a computer; moreover, two versions of the BCIANNET software were developed to be used with this hardware. This BCI used artificial neural network (ANN) as a main processing method, with the Butterworth filter used as the data pre-processing algorithm for ANN. Twelve subjects were measured to collect the datasets. Tasks were given to subjects to stimulate brain activity. The purpose of the experiments was to test and confirm the performance of the developed software. The aim of the software was to separate important rhythms such as alpha, beta, gamma and delta from other EEG signals. As a result, this study showed that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is the best compared with the backpropagation, resilient backpropagation, and error correction algorithms. The final developed version of the software is an effective tool for research in the field of BCI. The study showed that using the Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm gave an accuracy of prediction around 60% on the testing dataset.

For this purpose, electroencephalographic (EEG) methods complementing measures of autonomic functions and behavioral responses are in use in clinical practice. However, in human neonates and infants existing methods may be unreliable and the correlation between brain activity and anesthetic depth is still poorly understood. Here, we characterized the effects of different anesthetics on brain activity in neonatal mice and developed machine learning approaches to identify electrophysiological features predicting inspired or end-tidal anesthetic concentration as a proxy for anesthetic depth. We show that similar features from EEG recordings can be applied to predict anesthetic concentration in neonatal mice and humans. These results might support a novel strategy to monitor anesthetic depth in human newborns.

EEG decoding of the target speaker in a cocktail party scenario: considerations regarding dynamic switching of talker location	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						cocktail party; selective auditory attention; decoding attention	AUDITORY ATTENTION; SPEECH; RESPONSES; MEG; ENVIRONMENT; CONTINUITY; PATTERNS; PHASE	Objective. It has been shown that attentional selection in a simple dichotic listening paradigm can be decoded offline by reconstructing the stimulus envelope from single-trial neural response data. Mere, we test the efficacy of this approach in an environment with non-stationary talkers. We then look beyond the envelope reconstructions themselves and consider whether incorporating the decoder values-which reflect the weightings applied to the multichannel EEG data at different time lags and scalp locations when reconstructing the stimulus envelope-can improve decoding performance. Approach. high-density EEG was recorded as subjects attended to one of two talkers. The two speech streams were filtered using HRTFs, and the talkers were alternated between the left and right locations at varying intervals to simulate a dynamic environment. We trained spatio-temporal decoders mapping from EEG data to the attended and unattended stimulus envelopes. We then decoded auditory attention by (1) using the attended decoder to reconstruct the envelope and (2) exploiting the fact that decoder weightings themselves contain signatures of attention, resulting in consistent patterns across subjects that can be classified. Main results. The previously established decoding approach was found to be effective even with non-stationary talkers. Signatures of attentional selection and attended direction were found in the spatio-temporal structure of the decoders and were consistent across subjects. The inclusion of decoder weights into the decoding algorithm resulted in significantly unproved decoding accuracies (from 61.07% to 65.31% for 4s windows). An attempt was made to include alpha power lateralization as another feature to improve decoding, although this was unsuccessful at the single-trial level. Significance. This work suggests that the spatial-temporal decoder weights can be utilised to improve decoding. More generally, looking beyond envelope reconstruction and incorporating other signatures of attention is an avenue that should be explored to improve selective auditory attention decoding.

Manual scoring is a time-consuming and tedious task as well as it requires sleep specialists. Therefore, automatic sleep stage classification is necessary. In this paper, we have utilized state-of-the-art signal processing and machine learning techniques for sleep stage classification using single-channel EEG signal. Three cases of sleep classification have been done using support vector classifier (SVC), Decision tree (DT), Random forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB). The features extracted from pre-procesed EEG have been applied to Spectral Regression dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the model complexity. The Bayesian Optimization (BO) technique is applied to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifiers. Our proposed classification techniques provide the minimum error of 25.52%, 14.03%, and 4.93% for case I, case II and case III, respectively.

BCI enables the person to communicate with some electronic devices by interpreting brain activities. In this study, seven distinct hand movements were classified using the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) based BCI. EEG signals, which were recorded by researchers from the Autonomous University, were used. The classification was performed using algorithms of Naive Bayes, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) by applying Autoregressive (AR), Hjorth, and Power Spectral Density (PSD) features which were extracted from EEG signals. As a result, classifier performances are 71-86% for AR features, 60-79% for Hjorth features, and 75-93% for PSD features by regarding feature extraction methods. On the other hand, classifier performances are 69-86% for Naive Bayes, 76-93% for ELM, and 60-82% for SVM by regarding classification algorithms. Among achieved accuracy performances, the best accuracy is 93% when the combination of PSD features and ELM algorithm is used.

Insights into the brain mechanisms of chronic pain promise to advance the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and might help to develop disease markers and novel treatments. Here, we systematically exploited the potential of electroencephalography to determine abnormalities of brain function during the resting state in chronic pain. To this end, we performed state-of-the-art analyses of oscillatory brain activity, brain connectivity, and brain networks in 101 patients of either sex suffering from chronic pain. The results show that global and local measures of brain activity did not differ between chronic pain patients and a healthy control group. However, we observed significantly increased connectivity at theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (>60 Hz) frequencies in frontal brain areas as well as global network reorganization at gamma frequencies in chronic pain patients. Furthermore, a machine learning algorithm could differentiate between patients and healthy controls with an above-chance accuracy of 57%, mostly based on frontal connectivity. These results suggest that increased theta and gamma synchrony in frontal brain areas are involved in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Although substantial challenges concerning the reproducibility of the findings and the accuracy, specificity, and validity of potential electroencephalography-based disease markers remain to be overcome, our study indicates that abnormal frontal synchrony at theta and gamma frequencies might be promising targets for noninvasive brain stimulation and/or neurofeedback approaches.

To be effective team partners, machines will need to learn why uncertainty happens, how it happens, how long it will last, and possible mitigations the machine can supply. Electroencephalography-derived measures of team neurodynamic organization were used to identify times of uncertainty in military, health care, and high school problem-solving teams. A set of neurodynamic sequences was assembled that differed in the magnitudes and durations of uncertainty with the goal of training machines to detect the onset of prolonged periods of high level uncertainty, that is, when a team might require support. Variations in uncertainty onset were identified by classifying the first 70 s of the exemplars using self-organizing maps (SOM), a machine architecture that develops a topology during training that separates closely related from desperate data. Clusters developed during training that distinguished patterns of no uncertainty, low-level and quickly resolved uncertainty, and prolonged high-level uncertainty, creating opportunities for neurodynamic-based systems that can interpret the ebbs and flows in team uncertainty and provide recommendations to the trainer or team in near real time when needed.

Protecting Privacy of Users in Brain-Computer Interface Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Secure multiparty computation; cryptography; machine learning; linear regression; driver drowsiness estimation	LINEAR-REGRESSION; UNCONDITIONALLY SECURE	Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing research and industry. Many ML applications rely on the use of large amounts of personal data for training and inference. Among the most intimate exploited data sources is electroencephalogram (EEG) data, a kind of data that is so rich with information that application developers can easily gain knowledge beyond the professed scope from unprotected EEG signals, including passwords, ATM PINs, and other intimate data. The challenge we address is how to engage in meaningful ML with EEG data while protecting the privacy of users. Hence, we propose cryptographic protocols based on secure multiparty computation (SMC) to perform linear regression over EEG signals from many users in a fully privacy-preserving(PP) fashion, i.e., such that each individual's EEG signals are not revealed to anyone else. To illustrate the potential of our secure framework, we show how it allows estimating the drowsiness of drivers from their EEG signals as would be possible in the unencrypted case, and at a very reasonable computational cost. Our solution is the first application of commodity-based SMC to EEG data, as well as the largest documented experiment of secret sharing-based SMC in general, namely, with 15 players involved in all the computations.

It was found from the literature that successful results were obtained by using the feature extraction methods that are sensitive to local changes such as one-dimensional local binary patterns (1D-LBP). In 1D-LBP, the local changes in a signal were determined based on the comparisons between each "central value'' with its neighbors. In order to increase the sensitivity of extracted features from the local changes in a signal, each "value'' in the signal was compared with its neighbor, and by this way, a motif was obtained in the result of the comparisons in a specified window. To evaluate and validate the proposed approach, the non-EEG bio-signals, which were recorded by electrodermal activity, temperature, accelerometer, heart rate, and arterial oxygen level sensors, were employed. The features that were extracted from these signals by the proposed motif patterns were classified by machine learning methods. The neurological status of each of the samples was classified accurately by the proposed approach. Furthermore, the optimal sensor types were investigated and it was found that heart rate signals are enough to estimate the neurological status. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The goal of this research is to use electroencephalography (EEG) to establish a method for controlling drones using a brain-machine interface system based on the steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP). To reduce the load on participants during a long-time usage, such a system must be simplified. The proposed method is, therefore, limited to one EEG channel. Drones can exhibit five types of movement: taking off (rising), moving forward, turning right, turning left, and landing. Participants are therefore presented with five multiflickers simultaneously. However, concerns arise over the effect on classification accuracy with using only one channel of the SSVEP. We, therefore, evaluated the classification accuracy using long-short-term memory, which is a method of deep learning that has garnered significant attention. After conducting an experiment with four healthy men, the results indicated a high accuracy of 96% on average. A second experiment was conducted in which the three participants flew actual drones in a series of movements consisting of taking off, moving forward, and landing. We subsequently compared the accuracy of those movements and the flight times.

In particular, we exploit the low-frequency components of the steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEP) that contain consistent individualized patterns as the biometric. We evaluate the discriminating capabilities across different parameter configurations to optimize the CNN model. We also investigate how the length of EEG data impact the authentication performance. Our proposed framework achieved similar to 97% accuracy of cross-day user authentication across 8 subjects, shedding light on a practical EEG-based biometric powered by the CNN-based brain decoding.

Deep neural networks hold promise to achieve similar or even better performance, being more objective and consistent. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Medical ICU of five teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients: Eight-hundred ninety-five consecutive comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Continuous electroencephalogram was recorded during the first 3 days after cardiac arrest. Functional outcome at 6 months was classified as good (Cerebral Performance Category 1-2) or poor (Cerebral Performance Category 3-5). We trained a convolutional neural network, with a VGG architecture (introduced by the Oxford Visual Geometry Group), to predict neurologic outcome at 12 and 24 hours after cardiac arrest using electroencephalogram epochs and outcome labels as inputs. Output of the network was the probability of good outcome. Data from two hospitals were used for training and internal validation (n = 661). Eighty percent of these data was used for training and cross-validation, the remaining 20% for independent internal validation. Data from the other three hospitals were used for external validation (n = 234). Prediction of poor outcome was most accurate at 12 hours, with a sensitivity in the external validation set of 58% (95% CI, 51-65%) at false positive rate of 0% (CI, 0-7%). Good outcome could be predicted at 12 hours with a sensitivity of 48% (CI, 45-51%) at a false positive rate of 5% (CI, 0-15%) in the external validation set. Conclusions: Deep learning of electroencephalogram signals outperforms any previously reported outcome predictor of coma after cardiac arrest, including visual electroencephalogram assessment by trained electroencephalogram experts. Our approach offers the potential for objective and real time, bedside insight in the neurologic prognosis of comatose patients after cardiac arrest.

Domain Adaptation Techniques for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition: A Comparative Study on Two Public Datasets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Affective brain-computer interface (aBCI); cross dataset; domain adaptation; electroencephalography (EEG); emotion recognition; transfer learning	BRAIN; SELECTION; KERNEL	Affective brain-computer interface (aBCI) introduces personal affective factors to human-computer interaction. The state-of-the-art aBCI tailors its classifier to each individual user to achieve accurate emotion classification. A subject-independent classifier that is trained on pooled data from multiple subjects generally leads to inferior accuracy, due to the fact that electroencephalography patterns vary from subject to subject. Transfer learning or domain adaptation techniques have been leveraged to tackle this problem. Existing studies have reported successful applications of domain adaptation techniques on SEED dataset. However, little is known about the effectiveness of the domain adaptation techniques on other affective datasets or in a cross-dataset application. In this paper, we focus on a comparative study on several state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques on two datasets: 1) DEAP and 2) SEED. We demonstrate that domain adaptation techniques can improve the classification accuracy on both datasets, but not so effective on DEAP as on SEED. Then, we explore the efficacy of domain adaptation in a cross-dataset setting when the data are collected under different environments using different devices and experimental protocols. Here, we propose to apply domain adaptation to reduce the intersubject variance as well as technical discrepancies between datasets, and then train a subject-independent classifier on one dataset and test on the other. Experiment results show that using domain adaptation technique in a transductive adaptation setting can improve the accuracy significantly by 7.25%-13.40% compared to the baseline accuracy where no domain adaptation technique is used.

J	Usman, SM; Latif, S; Beg, A				Usman, Syed Muhammad; Latif, Shahzad; Beg, Arshad			Principle components analysis for seizures prediction using wavelet transform	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; Wavelet; PCA; Surrogate channel; CSP	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; FEATURES	Epilepsy is a disease in which frequent seizures occur due to abnormal activity of neurons. Patients affected by this disease can be treated with the help of medicines or surgical procedures. However, both of these methods are not quite useful. The only method to treat epilepsy patients effectively is to predict the seizure before its onset. It has been observed that abnormal activity in the brain signals starts before the occurrence of seizure known as the preictal state. Many researchers have proposed machine learning models for prediction of epileptic seizures by detecting the start of preictal state. However, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification remains a great challenge in the prediction of preictal state. Therefore, we propose a model that uses common spatial pattern filtering and wavelet transform for preprocessing, principal component analysis for feature extraction and support vector machines for detecting preictal state. We have applied our model on 23 subjects and an average sensitivity of 93.1% has been observed for 84 seizures. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by IASE.

J	Zhao, X; Zhang, RJ; Mei, ZN; Chen, C; Chen, W				Zhao, Xian; Zhang, Renjie; Mei, Zhenning; Chen, Chen; Chen, Wei			Identification of Epileptic Seizures by Characterizing Instantaneous Energy Behavior of EEG	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Seizure identification; electroencephalogram (EEG) signal; instantaneous energy; energy behavior	WEIGHTED VISIBILITY GRAPH; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FEATURE-SELECTION; SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; ENTROPIES; IDENTIFY; SVM	Automatic seizure detection has been often treated as a classification problem that aims at determining the label of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by computer science, as the EEG monitoring is a helpful adjunct to the diagnosis of epilepsy. In most existing work, the traditional signal energy of the EEG has been applied for classification, since the energy pattern of epileptic seizures differs from that of non-seizures. Although they are effective, the accuracy either heavily depends on additional information besides energy or is limited by the shortcoming of energy-based features. To address this issue, the proposed approach achieves the classification based on the instantaneous energy of the EEG signals instead. The proposed approach first measures the instantaneous energy related to changes in the EEG signals. Then, energy behavior over time is characterized by instantaneous energy-based features from different aspects. Finally, the classification is carried out on the features to produce output labels. By processing instantaneous energy, the information of energy evolution is involved. As such, the accuracy is improved without bringing in extra information besides energy, or complicated transformation. In multi-class problems, the proposed approach has obtained promising results for identifying the ictal EEG, which indicates the tremendous potential of the proposed approach for epileptic seizure detection.

When listening to speech, the brain tracks the speech envelope. It is possible to reconstruct this envelope from EEG recordings. However, in people who hear using a cochlear implant (CI), the artifacts caused by electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve contaminate the EEG. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a method for assessing the neural tracking of speech envelope in CI users. Approach. To obtain EEG recordings free of stimulus artifacts, the electrical stimulation is periodically interrupted. During these stimulation gaps, artifact-free EEG can be sampled and used to train a linear envelope decoder. EEG recordings obtained during audible and inaudible (i.e. sub-threshold) stimulation were used to characterize the artifacts and their influence on the envelope reconstruction. Main results. The present study demonstrates for the first time that neural tracking of the speech envelope can be measured in response to ongoing electrical stimulation. The responses were validated to be truly neural and not affected by stimulus artifact. Significance. Besides applications in audiology and neuroscience, the characterization and elimination of stimulus artifacts will enable future EEG studies involving continuous speech in CI users. Measures of neural tracking of the speech envelope reflect interesting properties of the listener's perception of speech, such as speech intelligibility or attentional state. Successful decoding of neural envelope tracking will open new possibilities to investigate the neural mechanisms of speech perception with a CI.

Classification of EEG signals to detect alcoholism using machine learning techniques	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Alcoholic signals; Wavelet packet decomposition; Support Vector Machine (SVM); Nave Bayes; Optimum Path Forest (OPF); Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)	DIAGNOSIS	The diagnosis of alcoholism is of great importance not only due to its effects on the individual and society but also the costs to the national health systems. Moreover, there are a large number of people suffering from this disease worldwide. Alcoholism has critical pathological effects on the liver, immune system, brain, and heart. Machine learning techniques are already well known for the classification of biosignals as they offer an efficient way to assist professionals in the automated diagnosis of various diseases, with high accuracy rates. This work presents the classification of alcoholic electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and machine learning techniques. The experiments were realized using the minimum value, maximum value, mean, standard deviation, power value, the ratio of absolute mean and the absolute mean as features to feed the classifiers. These features were combined with the objective of exploring the feasibility of such features to classify alcoholism. The classification task was performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Optimum-Path Forest (OPF), Nave Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). The results showed maximum values of 99.87% for specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy. These results were generated using the Nave Bayes classifier and the Biorthogonal wavelet family. A comparison with other techniques was performed aiming to validate our approach. The promising results, the inclusion of OPF classifier, and the specific combinations involving the chosen classifiers and wavelet families are the main contributions of this work. Finally, our strategy proved to be very effective in classifying alcoholic EEG signals. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To extend CSP algorithm to three-class motor imagery of left-hand, right-hand, both-feet, in this paper a three-class classification strategy based on Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) and voting mechanism is proposed. The strategy reduces a three-class problem to two binary-class problems. Two binary-class classifiers are constructed for the three-class Classification, both-hands vs both-feet and left-hand vs right-hand. The result shows an average three-class classification accuracy of 68.6% with BCI competition IV Datasets 2a, which is an encouraging result in motor imagery pattern recognition. And demonstrated that both-hands can be considered as one class in MI based BCI system.

On the Relative Contribution of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for SSVEP-Based Bio-Signal Decoding in BCI Speller Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; deep convolutional neural network; electroencephalography; steady state visual evoked potential; calibrationless; BCI; DCNN; CNN; EEG; SSVEP		Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) harnessing steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) manipulate the frequency and phase of visual stimuli to generate predictable oscillations in neural activity. For BCI spellers, oscillations are matched with alphanumeric characters allowing users to select target numbers and letters. Advances in BCI spellers can, in part, be accredited to subject-specific optimization, including; 1) custom electrode arrangements; 2) filter sub-band assessments; and 3) stimulus parameter tuning. Here, we apply deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) demonstrating cross-subject functionality for the classification of frequency and phase encoded SSVEP. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data are collected and classified using the same parameters across subjects. Subjects fixate forty randomly cued flickering characters (5x8 keyboard array) during concurrent wet-EEG acquisition. These data are provided by an open source SSVEP dataset. Our proposed DCNN, PodNet, achieves 86% and 77% offline accuracy of classification across-subjects for two data capture periods, respectively, 6-seconds (information transfer rate = 40 bpm) and 2-seconds (information transfer rate = 101 bpm). Subjects demonstrating suboptimal (<70%) performance are classified to similar levels after a short subject-specific training period. PodNet outperforms filter-bank canonical correlation analysis for a low volume (3-channel) clinically feasible occipital electrode configuration. The networks defined in this study achieve functional performance for the largest number of SSVEP classes decoded via DCNN to date. Our results demonstrate PodNet achieves cross-subject, calibrationless classification and adaptability to sub-optimal subject data, and low-volume EEG electrode arrangements.

In this paper, a novel classification algorithm is proposed based on the characteristic of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Specifically wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and Extreme learning machine with kernel (ELM_Kernel) algorithm are studied. In view of the existence of cross-banding of WPD, the average energy of the wavelet packets of the corresponding frequency bands which belong to the mu and beta rhythm are used to form the feature vectors that are classified by the ELM_Kernel algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces a high probability of correct classification of 97.8% and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as ELM, BP and SVM in terms of both training time and classification accuracy.

An Intelligent Sleep Apnea Classification System Based on EEG Signals	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification of sleep apnea; Electroencephalogram; Hilbert Huang transform; Infinite Impulse Response Butterworth Band pass filter; K-Nearest Neighbors; Support Vector Machine		Sleep Apnea is a sleep disorder which causes stop in breathing for a short duration of time that happens to human beings and animals during sleep. Electroencephalogram (EEG) plays a vital role in detecting the sleep apnea by sensing and recording the brain's activities. The EEG signal dataset is subjected to filtering by using Infinite Impulse Response Butterworth Band Pass Filter and Hilbert Huang Transform. After pre-processing, the filtered EEG signal is manipulated for sub-band separation and it is fissioned into five frequency bands such as Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta. This work employs features such as energy, entropy, and variance which are computed for each frequency band obtained from the decomposed EEG signals. The selected features are imported for the classification process by using machine learning classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Kernel Functions, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are computed and analyzed for each classifier and it is inferred that the Support Vector Machine based classification of sleep apnea produces promising results.

Decoding P300 Variability Using Convolutional Neural Networks	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neural decoding; EEG; deep learning; convolutional neural network; P300	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TASK; AMPLITUDE; P3A; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; LATENCY; UTILITY; INDEX	Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have previously been shown to be useful tools for signal decoding and analysis in a variety of complex domains, such as image processing and speech recognition. By learning from large amounts of data, the representations encoded by these deep networks are often invariant to moderate changes in the underlying feature spaces. Recently, we proposed a CNN architecture that could be applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding and analysis. In this article, we train our CNN model using data from prior experiments in order to later decode the P300 evoked response from an unseen, hold-out experiment. We analyze the CNN output as a function of the underlying variability in the P300 response and demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the experiment-induced changes in the neural response. We then assess the utility of our approach as a means of improving the overall signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG record. Finally, we show an example of how CNN-based decoding can be applied to the analysis of complex data.

Objectives: Identifying potential differences between children with mild and sever ASD based on EEG analysis using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and second-order difference plot (SODP) models, and determining the accuracy of such model outcome measures to distinguish ASD severity levels. Methods: Resting-state EEG data recorded for 36 children, who divided equally into two matched groups of mild and sever ASD. EMD analysis was applied to their EEG data to identify intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) features, SODP patterns, elliptical area and central tendency measure (CTM) values. Artificial neural network then used to determine the accuracy of this models outcome measures in distinguishing between the two ASD groups. Results: Children with sever ASD showed smaller, less twitches and oscillation of IMFs features, more stochastic SODP plotting, less CTM values, and higher ellipse area values compared to the children with mild ASD, which indicates their greater EEG variabilities and their greater inability to suppress their improper behavior. ANN ended with model sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 94.7%, respectively, and 97.2% overall accuracy of distinguishing between ASD groups. Conclusion: Children with sever and mild ASD had different IMFs features, SODP plotting, elliptical area and CTM values. In addition, these EMD outcome measures could serve as a sensitive automated tool to distinguish different severity levels in children with ASD.

Both are complex and are challenged by various artifacts. Therefore, preprocessing and feature extraction of these signals are a vital task so that artifacts can be suppressed and can be used for applications like biometric authentication systems. EOG is present as an artifact in EEG, but combination of EEG and EOG improves the feature recognition and classification accuracy. In this paper, firstly the EEG and EOG signals are preprocessed with the combination of stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and independent component analysis (SWT+ICA) to eliminate some unwanted components from EEG. For EOG signal processing, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used to extract eye blinks from the EEG data. After the preprocessing stage, feature extraction is carried out depending on time delineation in case of EOG and autoregressive modeling (AR) technique in case of EEG data. The extracted features of EEG/EOG can be fused together to develop a multimodal system which possesses high classification and recognition accuracy.

Emotion recognition is considered a highly valuable aspect of EC. Numerous studies have examined emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, but the recognition rate is unreliable. In this paper, a feature extraction method is proposed that is based on double tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) and machine learning. The emotions of 16 subjects are induced under video stimulation, and the original signal is acquired using a Neuroscan device. Both EEG and electromyography (EMG) signal are then eliminated by band-pass filtering, and the reconstructed signal of each frequency band is obtained by DTCWT. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) is utilized to classify three kinds of emotions: calm, happy, and sad, obtaining a classification accuracy of 90.61%. Results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the feature vector and improve the problem of low accuracy in multiple class recognition.

Visual inspection of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is expensive, time-consuming and prone to errors. Several numbers of automated seizure detection frameworks were proposed to replace the traditional methods and to assist neurophysiologists in identifying epileptic seizures accurately. However, these systems lagged in achieving high performance due to the anti-noise ability of feature extraction techniques, while EEG signals are highly susceptible to noise during acquisition. The present study put forwards a new entropy index Permutation Fuzzy Entropy (PFEN), which may delineate between ictal and interictal state of epileptic seizure using different machine learning classifiers. 10-fold cross-validation has been used to avoid the over-fitting of the classification model to achieve unbiased, stable, and reliable performance. The proposed index correctly distinguishes ictal and interictal states with an average accuracy of 98.72%, sensitivity of 98.82% and a specificity of 98.63%, across 21 patients with six epileptic seizure origins. The proposed system manifests the fact that lower PFEN characterizes the EEG during seizure state than in the Interictal seizure state. The study also helps us to investigate the more profound enactment of different classifiers in term of their distance metrics, learning rate, distance, weights, multiple scales, etc. rather than the conventional methods in the literature. Compared to other state of art entropy-based feature extraction methods, PFEN showed its potential to be a promising non-linear feature for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in seizure detection. It also show's its feasibility towards the development of a real-time EEG-based brain monitoring system for epileptic seizure detection.

In particular, electroencephalogram (EEC) signals arc known to be responsive and sensitive to variations in emotional state. In this paper, a 4-class emotion classification problem is investigated. Firstly, a clustering algorithm is used to determine the target class of each emotion-related data. Then wavelet analysis is used to extract features from 32-channel EEC signals. Finally, we compare live feature dimensionality reduction or feature selection algorithms and four types of machine learning based classifiers.

Due to the redundant information contained in multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, the classification accuracy of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems may deteriorate to a large extent. Channel selection methods can help to remove task-independent electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and hence improve the performance of BCI systems. However, in different frequency bands, brain areas associated with motor imagery are not exactly the same, which will result in the inability of traditional channel selection methods to extract effective EEG features. New Method. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on common spatial pattern- (CSP-) rank channel selection for multifrequency band EEG (CSP-R-MF). It combines the multiband signal decomposition filtering and the CSP-rank channel selection methods to select significant channels, and then linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to calculate the classification accuracy.

The EEG signals are acquired from 23 subjects, gathered from a headset consisting of 14 electrodes. Data are processed by applying Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for the signal analysis and an autoencoder neural network for the brain activity separation. Processing involves 74 wavelets from 3 DWT families: Coiflets, Daubechies and Symlets. Euclidean distance between clusters normalized with respect to the standard deviation of the whole set of data are used to separate each task performed by participants. The results of this stage allow for an assessment of separability between subsets of data associated with each activity performed by experiment participants. The speed of convergence of the training process employing deep learning-based clustering is also measured.

We estimate the cortical activations using power spectral density (PSD) with the Burg autoregressive model. On the other hand, we estimate the functional connectivity networks by utilizing the phase locking value (PLV). The results of cortical activations and connectivity networks show different patterns across three emotions at all frequency bands. Similarly, the results of fusion significantly improve the classification rate in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AROC), p < 0.05. The average improvement with fusion in all evaluation metrics are 6.84% and 4.1% when compared to PSD and PLV alone, respectively. The results clearly demonstrate the advantage of fusion of cortical activations with dynamic functional networks for developing human-computer interaction system in real-world applications.

However, how to design an appropriate DL model to accurately and efficiently classify electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is still a challenge, mainly because EEG signals are characterized by significant differences between two different subjects or vary over time within a single subject, non-stability, strong randomness, low signal-to-noise ratio. SincNet is an efficient classifier for speaker recognition, but it has some drawbacks in dealing with EEG signals classification. In this paper, we improve and propose a SincNet-based classifier, SincNet-R, which consists of three convolutional layers, and three deep neural network (DNN) layers. We then make use of SincNet-R to test the classification accuracy and robustness by emotional EEG signals. The comparable results with original SincNet model and other traditional classifiers such as CNN, LSTM and SVM, show that our proposed SincNet-R model has higher classification accuracy and better algorithm robustness.

Unsupervised Framework for the Identification of Visual Evoked Potential in MEG Measurements	2019 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (ICSPCS)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ICSPCS)	DEC 16-18, 2019	Surfers Paradise, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc, Univ Nebraska, Peter Kiewit Inst			INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; SIGNALS	Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) is used for the diagnostics of seizure disorders, such as epilepsy. In order to analyze the VEP, variations of the neural electric tensions on the area of visual cortex in the occiput are measured by Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Traditionally identification of VEP depends on the visual inspection of components by an expert. Currently supervised machine learning techniques have been applied to replace or to complement the visual inspection performed by the expert. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised framework for the identification of VEP in MEG measurements. In order to identify the VEP, we separate the measurement into two groups: the measurement without VEP and the measurements with VEP. Next, we compare the components from both groups in order to identify the components with VEP in the measurements with VEP. We validate our results using measurements from the Jena University Hospital.	[Javidi, Elnaz; da Costa, Joao Paulo C. L.; Miranda, Ricardo K.; Vargas, Jose A.

Characteristic spikes are often observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of epileptic patients in order to diagnose the disorder. Several methods have been investigated to automatically detect such spikes. The most common methods employ sub-band decomposition with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) or other filters to preprocess the EEG data before feeding it into a machine learning model. This paper introduces a fully data-driven method that automatically determines EEG frequency bands of interest. The raw signal is fed into a convolutional layer to detect suitable frequency bands, followed by a feedforward convolutional neural network (CNN) model or recurrent neural network (RNN) models for epileptic spike and non-spike classification. Fitting data of six patients, annotated by an epilepsy specialist, resulted in a convolutional layer with a frequency characteristic similar to bandpass filters. This result strongly justifies limiting the bandwidth of a signal, as done in previous studies. Moreover, results of the cross-subject validation indicate that a classical support vector machine with fixed preprocessing achieves comparable performance in the classification with fully data-driven models.

In our system, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (EKG) signals are used to analyze the subjects' real-time neural and cardiac activities, respectively, while subjects perform accuracy-constrained whole body movements as quickly and as accurately as possible in high fall-risk VR conditions. Salient features of neural and cardiac responses are analyzed to monitor anxiety-related changes in subjects during the performance of balance-demanding tasks. Validation of the proposed framework, integrating VR and sensor-based monitoring, may pave the way to smart and intuitive human-robot or brain-computer interface systems that can detect anxiety in human users during the performance of demanding motor tasks. The application of linear and radial basis function support vector machine classifiers suggest good performance in detecting anxiety using power of the alpha band from F3 and F4 channels of the EEG head cap. Our results suggest that frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) may be used as bio-marker for quantifying both trait and state anxiety, and further conclude that state anxiety is correlated with motor task performance.

In this regard, a number of research papers have been published for the identification of epileptic seizures. A thorough review of all these papers is required. So, an attempt has been made to review on the pattern detection methods for epilepsy seizure detection from EEG signals. More than 150 research papers have been discussed to determine the techniques for detecting epileptic seizures. Further, the literature review confirms that the pattern recognition techniques required to detect epileptic seizures varies across the electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets of different conditions. This is mostly owing to the fact that EEG detected under different conditions have different characteristics. This consecutively necessitates the identification of the pattern recognition technique to efficiently differentiate EEG epileptic data from the EEG data of various conditions.

However, the feature of physiological signals is associated with the historical values at the previous time steps and its statistical properties vary across individuals and types of mental tasks. In this study, we propose a new transfer dynamical autoencoder (TDAE) to capture the dynamical properties of electroencephalograph (EEG) features and the individual differences. The TDAE consists of three consecutively-connected modules, which are termed as feature filter, abstraction filter, and transferred MW classifier. The feature and abstraction filters introduce dynamical deep network to abstract the EEG features across adjacent time steps to salient MW indicators. Transferred MW classifier exploits large volume EEG data from an source-domain EEG database recorded under emotional stimuli to improve the model training stability. We tested our algorithms on two target EEG databases. The classification performance shows TDAE significantly outperforms existing shallow and deep MW classification models. We also investigated how to select TDAE hyper-parameters and found its superiority in accuracy can be achieved with proper filter orders. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to detect movement intention from EEG signals before execution of self-paced arm reaching movements. Methods: Ten healthy individuals were recruited. Movement onset was determined from surface electromyography recordings time-locked with EEG signals. Unlike previous studies, which employed feature extraction and classification for decoding, a nonlinear dynamic multiple-input/single output (MISO) model was developed. The MISO model consisted of a cascade of Volterra structures and a threshold block, generating the binary output corresponding to intention/no-intention. The modeling process included input selection from a pool of different EEG channels. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics curve, from which the optimum threshold was also selected. The Mann-Whitney statistics was employed to select the significant EEG channels for the output by examining the statistical significance of improvement in the predictive capability of the model when the respective channels were included. Results: With the proposed approach, movement intention was detected approximately 500 ms before the movement onset and on average, with an accuracy of 96.37 +/- 0.94%, a sensitivity of 77.93 +/- 4.40% and a specificity of 98.52 +/- 1.19%. Conclusions: The model output can be converted to motion commands for neuroprosthetic devices and exoskeletons in future applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This basically follows either a feature-level or decision-level strategy. In all likelihood, while features from several modalities may enhance the classification performance, they might exhibit high dimensionality and make the learning process complex for the most used machine learning algorithms. To overcome issues of feature extraction and multi-modal fusion, hybrid fuzzy-evolutionary computation methodologies are employed to demonstrate ultra-strong capability of learning features and dimensionality reduction. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal emotion aware system by fusing speech with EEG modalities. Firstly, a mixing feature set of speaker-dependent and independent characteristics is estimated from speech signal. Further, EEG is utilized as inner channel complementing speech for more authoritative recognition, by extracting multiple features belonging to time, frequency, and time-frequency. For classifying unimodal data of either speech or EEG, a hybrid fuzzy c-means-genetic algorithm-neural network model is proposed, where its fitness function finds the optimal fuzzy cluster number reducing the classification error. To fuse speech with EEG information, a separate classifier is used for each modality, then output is computed by integrating their posterior probabilities. Results show the superiority of the proposed model, where the overall performance in terms of accuracy average rates is 98.06%, and 97.28%, and 98.53% for EEG, speech, and multi-modal recognition, respectively. The proposed model is also applied to two public databases for speech and EEG, namely: SAVEE and MAHNOB, which achieve accuracies of 98.21% and 98.26%, respectively.

J	Kumar, S; Sharma, A; Tsunoda, T				Kumar, Shiu; Sharma, Alok; Tsunoda, Tatsuhiko			Brain wave classification using long short-term memory network based OPTICAL predictor	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION ALGORITHM; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; MOTOR-IMAGERY; COMPUTER-INTERFACE; SHIFT-DETECTION; MACHINE; DECOMPOSITION; MULTIVARIATE; PERFORMANCE; EXTRACTION	Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems having the ability to classify brain waves with greater accuracy are highly desirable. To this end, a number of techniques have been proposed aiming to be able to classify brain waves with high accuracy. However, the ability to classify brain waves and its implementation in real-time is still limited. In this study, we introduce a novel scheme for classifying motor imagery (MI) tasks using electroencephalography (EEG) signal that can be implemented in real-time having high classification accuracy between different MI tasks. We propose a new predictor, OPTICAL, that uses a combination of common spatial pattern (CSP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network for obtaining improved MI EEG signal classification. A sliding window approach is proposed to obtain the time-series input from the spatially filtered data, which becomes input to the LSTM network. Moreover, instead of using LSTM directly for classification, we use regression based output of the LSTM network as one of the features for classification. On the other hand, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the CSP variance based features. The features in the reduced dimensional plane after performing LDA are used as input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier together with the regression based feature obtained from the LSTM network. The regression based feature further boosts the performance of the proposed OPTICAL predictor. OPTICAL showed significant improvement in the ability to accurately classify left and right-hand MI tasks on two publically available datasets. The improvements in the average misclassification rates are 3.09% and 2.07% for BCI Competition IV Dataset I and GigaDB dataset, respectively. The Matlab code is available at https://github.com/ShiuKumar/OPTICAL.

Potential EEG biomarkers of sedation doses in intensive care patients unveiled by using a machine learning approach	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; ICU; sedation; brain networks; machine learning	DELAYED CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; ICU PATIENTS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; PROPOFOL; ANESTHESIA; HEART; INDEX; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; MIDAZOLAM	Objective. Sedation of neurocritically ill patients is one of the most challenging situation in ICUs. Quantitative knowledge on the sedation effect on brain activity in that complex scenario could help to uncover new markers for sedation assessment. Hence, we aim to evaluate the existence of changes of diverse EEG-derived measures in deeply-sedated (BASS-Richmond agitation-sedation scale -4 and -5) neurocritically ill patients, and also whether sedation doses are related with those eventual changes. Approach. We performed an observational prospective cohort study in the intensive care unit of the Hospital de la Princesa. Twenty-six adult patients suffered from traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage were included in the present study. Long-term continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings (2141h) and hourly annotated information were used to determine the relationship between intravenous sedation infusion doses and network and spectral EEG measures. To do that, two different strategies were followed: assessment of the statistical dependence between both variables using the Spearman correlation rank and by performing an automatic classification method based on a machine learning algorithm. Main results. More than 60% of patients presented a correlation greater than 0.5 in at least one of the calculated EEG measures with the sedation dose. The automatic classification method presented an accuracy of 84.3% in discriminating between different sedation doses. In both cases the nodes' degree was the most relevant measurement. Significance. The results presented here provide evidences of brain activity changes during deep sedation linked to sedation doses. Particularly, the capability of network EEG-derived measures in discriminating between different sedation doses could be the framework for the development of accurate methods for sedation levels assessment.

Brandon			Brain age from the electroencephalogram of sleep	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Brain age; Sleep; EEG; Machine learning	HEALTH; DEMENTIA; RISK; EEG	The human electroencephalogram (EEG) of sleep undergoes profound changes with age. These changes can be conceptualized as "brain age (BA)," which can be compared to chronological age to reflect the degree of deviation from normal aging. Here, we develop an interpretable machine learning model to predict BA based on 2 large sleep EEG data sets: the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) sleep lab data set (N = 2532; ages 18-80); and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS, N = 1974; ages 40-80). The model obtains a mean absolute deviation of 7.6 years between BA and chronological age (CA) in healthy participants in the MGH data set. As validation, a subset of SHHS containing longitudinal EEGs 5.2 years apart shows an average of 5.4 years increase in BA. Participants with significant neurological or psychiatric disease exhibit a mean excess BA, or "brain age index" (BAI = BA-CA) of 4 years relative to healthy controls. Participants with hypertension and diabetes have a mean excess BA of 3.5 years. The findings raise the prospect of using the sleep EEG as a potential biomarker for healthy brain aging.

Neuro-Detect: A Machine Learning-Based Fast and Accurate Seizure Detection System in the IoMT	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Smart homes; ambient intelligence; smart healthcare; Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT); deep neural network (DNN); electroencephalogram (EEG); seizure detection	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; TRANSFORM; NETWORKS; ENTROPY; DEVICES	Epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent spontaneous seizures, has a considerably negative impact on both the quality and the expectancy of life of the patient. Approximately 3.4 million individuals in the USA and up to 1% of the world population is afflicted by epilepsy. This necessitates the real-time detection of seizures which can be done by the use of an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for smart healthcare. In this paper, we propose an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure detection system in the IoT framework which uses the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), Hjorth parameters (HPs), statistical features, and a machine learning classifier. Seizure detection is done in two stages. In the first stage, EEG signals are decomposed by the DWT into sub-bands and features (activity, signal complexity, and standard deviation) were extracted from each of these sub-bands. In the second stage, a deep neural network (DNN) classifier is used to classify the EEG data. A prototype of the proposed neuro-detect was implemented using the hardware-in-the-loop approach. The results demonstrate a significant difference in HP values between interictal and ictal EEG with ictal EEG being less complex than interictal EEG. In this approach, we report an accuracy of 100% for a classification of normal versus ictal EEG and 98.6% for normal and interictal versus ictal EEG.

While this work has established the ability to decode identity-level information (such as the identity of a face or of a word) from neural signals, much less is known about the precise nature of the signals that support such feats, their robustness across visual categories, or their consistency across human participants. Here, we address these questions through the use of EEG-based decoding and multivariate feature selection as applied to three visual categories: words, faces and face ensembles (i.e., crowds of faces). Specifically, we use recursive feature elimination to estimate the diagnosticity of time and frequency-based EEG features for identity-level decoding across three datasets targeting each of the three categories. We then relate feature diagnosticity across categories and across participants while, also, aiming to increase decoding performance and reliability. Our investigation shows that word and face processing are similar in their reliance on spatiotemporal information provided by occipitotemporal channels. In contrast, ensemble processing appears to also rely on central channels and exhibits a similar profile with word processing in the frequency domain. Further, we find that feature diagnosticity is stable across participants and is even capable of supporting cross-participant feature selection, as demonstrated by systematic boosts in decoding accuracy and feature reduction. Thus, our investigation sheds new light on the nature and the structure of the information underlying identity-level visual processing as well as on its generality across categories and participants.

Seizures are characterized by periodic episodes and unpredictability. The automatic detection and analysis of seizures based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is of grate important for accurately identifying patients and reducing the work intensity of medical staff. This paper presents an epilepsy and seizure classification approach based on multi spike liquid state machines. Firstly, this paper describes the network structure and neuron model, and introduces the EEG data encoding method. In addition, the proposed approach is used to solve the multi-classification problems of epilepsy data and conduct related experiments. At last, the experimental results show that the proposed approach has a great ability to solve the classification problems of epilepsy EEG data, and has a high classification accuracy rate. The average recognition accuracy rate reaches 71.23%, which has certain value in real life.

However, the classification accuracy of CNNs is compromised when target data are distorted. Specifically for motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG), the measured signals, even from the same person, are not consistent and can be significantly distorted. To overcome these limitations, we propose to apply a capsule network (CapsNet) for learning various properties of EEG signals, thereby achieving better and more robust performance than previous CNN methods. The proposed CapsNet-based framework classifies the two-class motor imagery, namely right-hand and left-hand movements. The motor imagery EEG signals are first transformed into 2D images using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) algorithm and then used for training and testing the capsule network. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated on the BCI competition IV 2b dataset. The proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and various conventional machine learning approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for classification of motor imagery EEG signals.

These recordings are defined as the areas of the brain which can be surgically removed to reach control of seizure. The characteristics of the brain area affected by partial epilepsy can be analyzed using focal and non-focal EEG signals. In this work, a method for the classification of focal and non-focal EEG signals is presented to compare different feature extraction methods combined with multi-scale principal component analysis (MSPCA) denoising and Random Forest (RF) as a machine learning technique. After de-noising, different feature extraction methods (EMD, DWT and WPD) are applied. The performance of RF classifier is measured according to accuracy, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) and F-measure. EEG based focal region localization with Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) feature extraction and RF classifier reach 99.92% accuracy. Hence, WPD combined with RF machine learning classifier can be used to differentiate the focal and non-focal EEG signals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This explains why there is no gold standard for monitoring the Depth of Anesthesia (DoA) and why experimental studies may use several electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, ranging from 2 to 128 EEG-channels. Our study aimed at finding the scalp area providing valuable information about brain activity under general anesthesia (GA) to select the more optimal EEG channel to characterized the DoA. We included 30 patients undergoing elective, minor surgery under GA and used a 32-channel EEG to record their electrical brain activity. In addition, we recorded their physiological parameters and the BIS monitor. Each individual EEG channel data were processed to test their ability to differentiate awake from asleep states. Due to strict quality criteria adopted for the EEG data and the difficulties of the real-life setting of the study, only 8 patients recordings were taken into consideration in the final analysis. Using 2 classification algorithms, we identified the optimal channels to discriminate between asleep and awake states: the frontal and temporal F8 and T7 were retrieved as being the two bests channels to monitor DoA. Then, using only data from the F8 channel, we tried to minimize the number of features required to discriminate between the awake and asleep state. The best algorithm turned out to be the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) requiring only 5 features (Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC- of 0.93 +/- 0.04). This finding may pave the way to improve the assessment of DoA by combining one EEG channel recordings with a multimodal physiological monitoring of the brain state under GA. Further work is needed to see if these results may be valid to asses the depth of sedation in ICU.

Here, we present a BCI dataset that includes the three major BCI paradigms with a large number of subjects over multiple sessions. In addition, information about the psychological and physiological conditions of BCI users was obtained using a questionnaire, and task-unrelated parameters such as resting state, artifacts, and electromyography of both arms were also recorded. We evaluated the decoding accuracies for the individual paradigms and determined performance variations across both subjects and sessions. Furthermore, we looked for more general, severe cases of BCI illiteracy than have been previously reported in the literature. Results: Average decoding accuracies across all subjects and sessions were 71.1% (+/- 0.15), 96.7% (+/- 0.05), and 95.1% (+/- 0.09), and rates of BCI illiteracy were 53.7%, 11.1%, and 10.2% for MI, ERP, and SSVEP, respectively. Compared to the ERP and SSVEP paradigms, the MI paradigm exhibited large performance variations between both subjects and sessions. Furthermore, we found that 27.8% (15 out of 54) of users were universally BCI literate, i.e., they were able to proficiently perform all three paradigms. Interestingly, we found no universally illiterate BCI user, i.e., all participants were able to control at least one type of BCI system. Conclusions: Our EEG dataset can be utilized for a wide range of BCI-related research questions. All methods for the data analysis in this study are supported with fully open-source scripts that can aid in every step of BCI technology. Furthermore, our results support previous but disjointed findings on the phenomenon of BCI illiteracy.

Sleep disorders, however, lead to a reduced quality of sleep and as a result, affect the standard of human life. It is important to classify sleep stages in order to detect sleep disorders. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are obtained from patients under observation. But, classifying these EEG signals into various sleep stages is an arduous task. It becomes more difficult when one tries to classify EEG signals visually. Even sleep specialists struggle to classify the EEG signals into different sleep stages by visual inspection. Several approaches have been adopted by scientists across the world to mitigate these errors by using EEG and polysomnogram signals. In this paper, an automated method has been proposed for scoring various sleep stages employing EEG signals. We have employed a two-band energy-localized filter in the time-frequency domain, which decomposed six sub-bands using five-level wavelet decomposition. Subsequently, we compute discriminatory features namely fuzzy entropy and log energy from the decomposed coefficients. The extracted features are fed to various supervised machine learning classifiers. Our proposed approach yielded an accuracy of 91.5% and 88.5% for six-class classification task using small and large datasets, respectively.

This requires the combination of well-established neural mechanisms, and the development of increasingly sensitive methodologies. The P300 event-related potential (ERP) has been one of the most heavily investigated neural markers of attention and cognition, and studies have reliably shown that changes in the amplitude and latency of the P300 ERP index the process of aging. However, it is still not clear whether either the P3a or P3b sub-components additionally index levels of cognitive impairment. Here, we used a traditional visual three-stimulus oddball paradigm to investigate both the P3a and P3b ERP components in sixteen young and thirty-four healthy elderly individuals with varying degrees of cognitive ability. EEG data extraction was enhanced through the use of a novel signal processing method called Functional Source Separation (FSS) that increases signal-to-noise ratio by using a weighted sum of all electrodes rather than relying on a single, or a small sub-set, of EEG channels. Whilst clear differences in both the P3a and P3b ERPs were seen between young and elderly groups, only P3b amplitude differentiated older people with low memory performance relative to IQ from those with consistent memory and IQ. A machine learning analysis showed that P3b amplitude (derived from FSS analysis) could accurately categorise high and low performing elderly individuals (78% accuracy). A comparison of Bayes Factors found that differences in cognitive decline within the elderly group were 87 times more likely to be detected using FSS compared to the best performing single electrode (Cz). In conclusion, we propose that P3b amplitude could be a sensitive marker of early, age-independent, episodic memory dysfunction within a healthy older population. In addition, we advocate for the use of more advanced signal processing methods, such as FSS, for detecting subtle neural changes in clinical populations.

The Current Research Landscape on the Artificial Intelligence Application in the Management of Depressive Disorders: A Bibliometric Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						artificial intelligence; machine learning; depression; depressive disorders; bibliometric analysis	LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION; PREDICTION; ETHICS; FUTURE	Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques have been widely applied in depression research and treatment. Nonetheless, there is currently no systematic review or bibliometric analysis in the medical literature about the applications of AI in depression. We performed a bibliometric analysis of the current research landscape, which objectively evaluates the productivity of global researchers or institutions in this field, along with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA). From 2010 onwards, the total number of papers and citations on using AI to manage depressive disorder have risen considerably. In terms of global AI research network, researchers from the United States were the major contributors to this field. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the most well-studied application of AI was the utilization of machine learning to identify clinical characteristics in depression, which accounted for more than 60% of all publications. Latent dirichlet allocation identified specific research themes, which include diagnosis accuracy, structural imaging techniques, gene testing, drug development, pattern recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG)-based diagnosis. Although the rapid development and widespread use of AI provide various benefits for both health providers and patients, interventions to enhance privacy and confidentiality issues are still limited and require further research.

But the main obstacle of analyzing EEG signal is various types of noises to get actual information. Extracting important features is a key issue in this study. This paper uses the BCI Competition IV 2b motion imagery data, in which we provide a review of various prior art to determine the motion imaginary MI mission. Using machine learning to identify two different movements in the EEG signal, the data from nine subjects were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) combined with discrete wavelet (DWT) packet analysis. The extracted DWT feature is input into the support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and the experimental results shows that this method is better than traditional methods with a classification accuracy rate of 86.7%.

Utilizing HFOs for epilepsy surgery planning offers the promise of improved seizure outcomes for patients with medically refractory epilepsy. This review discusses possible machine learning strategies that can be applied to HFO biomarkers to better identify epileptogenic regions. We discuss the role of HFO rate, and utilizing features such as explicit HFO properties (spectral content, duration, and power) and phase-amplitude coupling for distinguishing pathological HFO (pHFO) events from physiological HFO events. In addition, the review highlights the importance of neuroanatomical localization in machine learning strategies.

One of the most important challenges, associatedwith classification of EEG signals is how to design an efficient classifier consisting of strong generalization capability. Aiming to improve the classification performance, in this paper, we propose a novel multiclass support matrix machine (M-SMM) from the perspective of maximizing the inter-class margins. The objective function is a combination of binary hinge loss that works on C matrices and spectral elastic net penalty as regularization term. This regularization term is a combination of Frobenius and nuclear norm, which promotes structural sparsity and shares similar sparsity patterns across multiple predictors. It also maximizes the inter-class margin that helps to deal with complex high dimensional noisy data. The extensive experiment results supported by theoretical analysis and statistical tests show the effectiveness of the M-SMM for solving the problem of classifying EEG signals associated with motor imagery in brain-computer interface applications.

Actions of facial units convey various information from our brains. This paper proposed a comprehensive approach to explore whether pattern of sequences of the drivers facial landmarks changes from the alert start to the fatigue state. A driving-simulator-based experiment was designed and conducted. Videos of 21 participants faces were recorded during the experiment, together with subjective and others assessment of the level of alertness. Sequences of eye aspect ratio (EAR) and mouth aspect ratio (MAR) were calculated based on facial landmarks. Totally 21 feature candidates including Percent eye-closure over a fixed time window (PERCLOS), blink rate, statistics of blink duration, closing speed, reopening speed and number of yawns were extracted. A mental fatigue assessment model is proposed after feature selection. Four machine learning algorithms were used to build the assessment model of fatigue. The best performance was achieved by logistic regression, with cross-validation accuracies of 83.7 and 85.4. This study may contribute to the development of driver fatigue monitoring system for automotive ergonomics.

ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) Method for Detecting Acute Ischemic Stroke using Conventional and Specific Asymmetry BSI (Brain Symmetry Index) features based on EEG Signals	3RD BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING'S RECENT PROGRESS IN BIOMATERIALS, DRUGS DEVELOPMENT, AND MEDICAL DEVICES	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium of Biomedical Engineering (ISBE) on Recent Progress in Biomaterials, Drugs Development, and Medical Devices	AUG 06-08, 2018	Jakarta, INDONESIA	Univ Indonesia, Off Res Prod & Innovat Management, Univ Indonesia, Res Ctr Biomed Engn		Acute Ischemic Stroke; Brain Symmetry Index (BSI); DAR (delta / alpha); DTBAR (Delta plus Theta)/(Alpha plus Beta); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Extreme Learning Machine (ELM); Specific Asymmetry BSI	QUANTITATIVE EEG; DELTA/ALPHA RATIO	Generally, acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) is diagnosed using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), CT (Computed Tomography) or fMRI (Functional MRI). However, MRI, fMRI, and CT are not available in community hospitals (C-type hospitals, PUSKESMAS). In addition, MRI, fMRI, and CT cannot measure for a long time or are unlikely to do continuous scanning. In most community hospitals, they have EEG (Electroencephalogram) machines to record brain waves. There are several methods available for detecting AIS, namely BSI (Brain symmetry Index), DAR (delta /alpha) and DTABR (delta + theta) /(alpha + beta) that analyze the power ratio of brain waves from the whole brain. These methods need to be refined. Therefore, authors attempt to use new method: specific asymmetry BSI. This method compares the frequencies not for 1-25 Hz like BSI method, but looking for specific frequency band and the power ratio of brainwave from right and left hemisphere. To develop a stroke detection system, author uses the algorithm Extreme Machine Learning (ELM) because ELM provides accurate data with high speed rather read by human eye. All data were obtained from RS PON (Rumah Sakit Pusat Otak Nasional), Jakarta in edf format. There were 66 voluntary subjects and analyzed with Matlab. The BSIs and specific asymmetry BSIs were calculated using pwelch methods, and the DARs and DTABRs were calculated using wavelet db4. The ELM algorithm was confirmed using CT-scan, which was diagnosed by qualified doctors. It is expected that this method would be useful for detecting AIS in community hospitals.

J	Li, JL; Li, ZJ; Feng, Y; Liu, YL; Shi, GM				Li, Jianlong; Li, Zhijun; Feng, Ying; Liu, Yiliang; Shi, Guangming			Development of a Human-Robot Hybrid Intelligent System Based on Brain Teleoperation and Deep Learning SLAM	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Simultaneous localization and mapping; Mobile robots; Robot kinematics; Deep learning; Brain teleoperation; deep learning; human-robot hybrid system; motor imagery (MI); visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)	MOTOR IMAGERY; PATTERNS	To achieve the better navigation performance of a mobile robot in the unknown environments, a novel human-robot hybrid system incorporating a motor-imagery (MI)-based brain teleoperation control is presented in this paper, where a deep-learning-based active perception is developed in the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework. Using the deep-learning-based object recognition in the red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) data acquisition process, the designed SLAM approach can select the valid feature points effectively, and the speed of displacement tracking can be improved by combining the oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) SLAM algorithm with the optical flow method. The global trajectory map can also be mended using graph-based nonlinear error optimization. In addition, to build the connection between human intentions and the robot control commands flexibly in the developed mobile robot, a common spatial pattern (CSP)-based support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm is proposed so that the control commands can be obtained directly from the human electroencephalograph (EEG) signals, which are preanalyzed and classified using the phenomena of event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD). Experiments involving several operators have verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the actual unstructured environments. Note to Practitioners This paper is motivated by the exploration of the mobile robots remotely controlled by the disables in an unstructured environment that includes some unknown moving objects in the background. In the conventional approaches, the image feedback and the brain-computer interface-based EEG signals invoked by the visual stimulus are used to guide the motion of the robots. In this paper, the MI of left or right hand is adopted as an input of the brain teleoperation system, and the EEG signals are classified into two categories representing two robot control commands through the designed algorithm. Besides, a deep-learning-based SLAM is designed to analyze the image and depth of the environmental information provided by the robot RGB-D sensor, and the results can be transferred into a 3-D map locating the robot and assisting the operator to understand the operating environment. It has been verified that the deep-learning-based SLAM presented is more efficient and robust than traditional SLAM. The feasibility of the system is demonstrated by a set of experiments in the corridor environment.

Deep Learning based Image Reconstruction from Brain Data during Object-Grasping Task with a BMI	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED ROBOTICS AND ITS SOCIAL IMPACTS (ARSO)	IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts		English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Its Social Impacts (IEEE ARSO)	OCT 31-NOV 02, 2019	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				Brain-machine interface systems (BMI) have allowed the control of prosthetics and robotic arms using brainwaves alone to do simple tasks such as grasping an object. However, the low throughput information of brain-data decoding does not allow the robotic arm to achieve diverse grasp configurations for different types of objects. On the other hand, computer vision researchers have mostly solved the problem of robot hand configuration for object-grasping given visual object recognition. It is then natural to think that if the robotic arm could decode from brain data the image of the object that the user intends to grasp, then it could automatically decide the type of grasping to execute. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a method to decode visual representations of objects from brain data towards improving robot arm grasp configurations. More specifically, we recorded EEG data during an object-grasping experiment in which the participant had to control a robotic arm using a BMI to grasp an object. We also recorded images of the object and developed a multimodal representation of the encoded brain data and object image. Given this representation, the objective was to reconstruct the image given that only half of the image (the brain data encoding) was provided. To achieve this goal, we developed a deep convolutional autoencoder that learned a noise-free joint manifold of brain data encoding and the object image. After training, the autoencoder was able to reconstruct the missing part of the object image given that only brain data encoding was provided.

J	Yahya, N; Musa, H; Ong, ZY; Elamvazuthi, I				Yahya, Norashikin; Musa, Huwaida; Ong, Zhong Yi; Elamvazuthi, Irraivan			Classification of Motor Functions from Electroencephalogram (EEG) Signals Based on an Integrated Method Comprised of Common Spatial Pattern and Wavelet Transform Framework	SENSORS			English	Article						grasp-and-lift; CSP; CWT; scalogram; multiresolution; eigendecomposition; generalized eigen value decomposition; matrix joint diagonalization; oriented energy		In this work, an algorithm for the classification of six motor functions from an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal that combines a common spatial pattern (CSP) filter and a continuous wavelet transform (CWT), is investigated. The EEG data comprise six grasp-and-lift events, which are used to investigate the potential of using EEG as input signals with brain computer interface devices for controlling prosthetic devices for upper limb movement. Selected EEG channels are the ones located over the motor cortex, C3, Cz and C4, as well as at the parietal region, P3, Pz and P4. In general, the proposed algorithm includes three main stages, band pass filtering, CSP filtering, and wavelet transform and training on GoogLeNet for feature extraction, feature learning and classification. The band pass filtering is performed to select the EEG signal in the band of 7 Hz to 30 Hz while eliminating artifacts related to eye blink, heartbeat and muscle movement. The CSP filtering is applied on two-class EEG signals that will result in maximizing the power difference between the two-class dataset. Since CSP is mathematically developed for two-class events, the extension to the multiclass paradigm is achieved by using the approach of one class versus all other classes. Subsequently, continuous wavelet transform is used to convert the band pass and CSP filtered signals from selected electrodes to scalograms which are then converted to images in grayscale format. The three scalograms from the motor cortex regions and the parietal region are then combined to form two sets of RGB images. Next, these RGB images become the input to GoogLeNet for classification of the motor EEG signals. The performance of the proposed classification algorithm is evaluated in terms of precision, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy with average values of 94.8%, 93.5%, 94.7%, 94.1%, respectively, and average area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve equal to 0.985. These results indicate a good performance of the proposed algorithm in classifying grasp-and-lift events from EEG signals.

These fields require new paradigms toward understanding increasingly complex data and converting such data into medical products and services for patients. The move toward deep learning and complex modeling is an attempt to bridge the gap between acquiring massive quantities of complex data, and converting such data into practical insights. Here, we provide an overview of the field of machine learning, its current applications and needs in traditional and emerging fields, and discuss an illustrative attempt at using deep learning to understand swarm behavior of molecular shuttles.

We hypothesized that high classification results in ADHD diagnosis are inflated by methodological factors. METHODS: We reviewed 69 studies (of 95 studies identified) that used neuroimaging features to predict ADHD diagnosis. Based on reported methods, we assessed the prevalence of circular analysis, which inflates classification accuracy, and evaluated the relationship between sample size and accuracy to test if small-sample models tend to report higher classification accuracy, also an indicator of bias. RESULTS: Circular analysis was detected in 15.9% of ADHD classification studies, lack of independent test set was noted in 13%, and insufficient methodological detail to establish its presence was noted in another 11.6%. Accuracy of classification ranged from 60% to 80% in the 59.4% of reviewed studies that met criteria for independence of feature selection, model construction, and test datasets. Moreover, there was a negative relationship between accuracy and sample size, implying additional bias contributing to reported accuracies at lower sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: High classification accuracies in neuroimaging studies of ADHD appear to be inflated by circular analysis and small sample size. Accuracies on independent datasets were consistent with known heterogeneity of the disorder. Steps to resolve these issues, and a shift toward accounting for sample heterogeneity and prediction of future outcomes, will be crucial in future classification studies in ADHD.

There exists an urgent need for an efficient technique for early detection of epileptic seizures at its initial stage in order to save the lives of thousands of epileptic patients annually. Now a days, internet of things in combination with machine learning techniques and cloud computing services has emerged as a powerful technology to resolve many problems in healthcare sector. This paper also presents an automatic epileptic seizure detection system and its layered architecture for early detection of epileptic seizures using existing communication technologies in collaboration with machine learning and cloud computing. This model transmits sensed EEG signals from patient's scalp to cloud through 4G cellular network or Wi-Fi network. At cloud, EEG signals are processed using Fast Walsh Hadamard transform and higher order spectra (HOS) based feature extraction for extracting higher order statistics and entropy-based features. The correlation-based feature selection algorithm has been employed for reducing the dimensionality of EEG datasets so as to tackle the problem of large volume of data and to reduce delays in service offered to the end user. Random Forest algorithm has been employed for classification of EEG signals into three different seizure stages, viz., normal, preictal and ictal. For performance analysis, other well-known machine learning algorithms like Bayes Net, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Basis function neural network and C4.5 Decision Tree are also considered. The simulation and testing results show that Random Forest classifier provides maximum values of classification accuracy of 99.40%, sensitivity of 99.40% and specificity of 99.66%, minimum mean square error of 0.0871 along with optimum training time of 20 ms, which makes this model more real time compatible, thereby making HOS features based Random Forest algorithm's cloud model an efficient technique for early and automatic detection of epileptic seizures in real time.

The medical devices industry is now able to produce small and reliable EEG systems, enabling a wide variety of applications also with no-clinical aims, providing a powerful tool to neuroscientific research. However, these systems still suffer from a critical limitation, consisting in the use of wet electrodes, that are uncomfortable and require expertise to install and time from the user. In this context, dozens of different concepts of EEG dry electrodes have been recently developed, and there is the common opinion that they are reaching traditional wet electrodes quality standards. However, although many papers have tried to validate them in terms of signal quality and usability, a comprehensive comparison of different dry electrode types from multiple points of view is still missing. The present work proposes a comparison of three different dry electrode types, selected among the main solutions at present, against wet electrodes, taking into account several aspects, both in terms of signal quality and usability. In particular, the three types consisted in gold-coated single pin, multiple pins and solid-gel electrodes. The results confirmed the great standards achieved by dry electrode industry, since it was possible to obtain results comparable to wet electrodes in terms of signals spectra and mental states classification, but at the same time drastically reducing the time of montage and enhancing the comfort. In particular, multiple-pins and solid-gel electrodes overcome gold-coated single-pin-based ones in terms of comfort.

EEG signal classification using LSTM and improved neural network algorithms	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						LSTM; Neural network (NN); Improved NN; Logistic regression; EEG; Accuracy	ALPHA; ARCHITECTURE; TUMORS	Neural network (NN) finds role in variety of applications due to combined effect of feature extraction and classification availability in deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we have chosen SVM, logistic regression machine learning algorithms and NN for EEG signal classification. Two-layer LSTM and four-layer improved NN deep learning algorithms are proposed to improve the performance in EEG classification. Novelty lies in one-dimensional gradient descent activation functions with radial basis operations used in the initial layers of improved NN which help in achieving better performance. Statistical features namely mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness are extracted for input EEG collected from Bonn database and then applied for various classification techniques. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score are the performance metrics used for analyzing the algorithms. Improved NN and LSTM give better performance compared to all other architectures. The simulations are carried out with variety of activation functions, optimizers and loss models to analyze the performance using Python in keras.

Based on this, MI has been used in many brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, ranging from motor rehabilitation to the actual control of external hardware and other devices. Although great improvement has been made in the field, MI-BCIs still face several issues that limit their applicability to the clinical environment. The aim of this work was to improve on the understanding of one of these issues - namely, the inter and intra-subject variability regarding the electroencephalography (EEG) signals produced by MI tasks. EEG data from 10 healthy subjects who underwent 12 hands-MI sessions, without any feedback, were collected. Differently than most current studies in the field, we screened our analysis into small frequency intervals, from 526 Hz, at 4 Hz steps. We then computed how often a given (electrode, frequency interval) pair was optimal for BCI classification, across all sessions, attempting to identify features that would maximize reproducibility. Although similar electrodes are most recurrent across all subjects, each participant displayed their own particularities. Also, these individual patterns did not necessarily reflect the traditional locations over the primary sensorimotor cortex of most EEG-MI studies. Furthermore, our classification results suggested that identifying the best spectral intervals, and not just electrodes, is crucial for improving results. Given the reduced number of existing training protocols supporting individualization, we emphasize that considering subjects' particularities is essential.

Hemicraniectomy in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Noninvasive Platform to Investigate High Gamma Activity for Brain Machine Interfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-machine interface; brain-computer interface; EEG; traumatic brain injury; high gamma	COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOVEMENTS; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; INFORMATION; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; MONKEY	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) translate brain signals into control signals for an external device, such as a computer cursor or robotic limb. These signals can be obtained either noninvasively or invasively. Invasive recordings, using electrocorticography (ECoG) or intracortical microelectrodes, provide higher bandwidth and more informative signals. Rehabilitative BMIs, which aim to drive plasticity in the brain to enhance recovery after brain injury, have almost exclusively used non-invasive recordings, such electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), which have limited bandwidth and information content. Invasive recordings provide more information and spatiotemporal resolution, but do incur risk, and thus are not usually investigated in people with stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, in this paper, we describe a new BMI paradigm to investigate the use of higher frequency signals in brain-injured subjects without incurring significant risk. We recorded EEG in TBI subjects who required hemicraniectomies (removal of a part of the skull). EEG over the hemicraniectomy (hEEG) contained substantial information in the high gamma frequency range (65-115 Hz). Using this information, we decoded continuous fingerflexion force with moderate to high accuracy(variance accounted for 0.06 to 0.52), which at best approaches that using epidural signals. These results indicate that people with hemicraniectomies can provide a useful resource for developing BMI therapies for the treatment of brain injury.

Single-trial detection in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of brain evoked responses, like event-related potentials (ERPs), requires multiple processing stages, in the spatial and temporal domains, to extract high level features. Convolutional neural networks, as a type of deep learning method, have been used for EEG signal detection as the underlying structure of the EEG signal can be included in such system, facilitating the learning step. The EEG signal is typically decomposed into 2 main dimensions: space and time. However, the spatial dimension can be decomposed into 2 dimensions that better represent the relationships between the sensors that are involved in the classification. We propose to analyze the performance of 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks for the classification of ERPs with a dataset based on 64 EEG channels. We propose and compare 6 conv net architectures: 4 using 3D convolutions, that vary in relation to the number of layers and feature maps, and 2 using 2D convolutions. The results support the conclusion that 3D convolutions provide better performance than 2D convolutions for the binary classification of ERPs.

We first establish the feasibility of object ranking (based on an EEG wearable) by a trial and error based analysis of the EEG signals. We then present a machine learning algorithm Cerebro, which can learn the specific nuances of the user's brainwaves for preferences to accurately rank the objects. We measure the accuracy of the algorithm in terms of the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and show that it performs well when trained on 7 objects, and evaluated on 3 objects for the 14 users.

The BCI is a non-muscle communication link between brain and external device, which commonly designed to enable patients with neurological condition to interact with others using their brain signals. In this work, we investigated the classification of EEG eye state data using statistical and CSP filter technique. Statistical feature has been applied in EEG signal classifications of eye-close and eye-open conditions but the accuracy is reported to be less than 78%. CSP filter is a well-known method for classification of motor imagery EEG in the BCI field but when applied for EEG eye state classification, it only gives accuracy similar to statistical feature, that is less than 78%. These indicate that both methods give good discrimination of the eye state condition but on it own, will not be sufficient to produce good classification accuracy. Hence, this work aims to develop an algorithm using statistical-CSP feature for eye state classification from EEG signal. This is taking advantage on the discriminative feature provided by both methods, statistical and CSP filter, which is expected to increase the accuracy of the eye state classification algorithm. The process of developing the EEG eye state classification algorithm, includes data extraction, pre-processing, data normalization, feature extraction, feature selection and classification are detailed out in this paper. Number of selected electrodes are divided into 3 groups, with 2 groups having a set of 7 different electrodes and 1 group that combined both sets of 7 electrodes giving a total of 14 electrodes. Using ten-fold cross validation, the highest accuracy of statistical feature is at 54.3% and the highest accuracy of CSP feature is at 72.3% generated using fine Gaussian SVM classifier. Result from this work has shown that combining both statistical and CSP features from 7 electrodes of Group I has shown to result in good accuracy of 99.92%.

In this paper, based on the spatial-temporal structure of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, we develop a novel EEG-based spatial-temporal convolutional neural network (ESTCNN) to detect driver fatigue. First, we introduce the core block to extract temporal dependencies from EEG signals. Then, we employ dense layers to fuse spatial features and realize classification. The developed network could automatically learn valid features from EEC signals, which outperforms the classical two-step machine learning algorithms. Importantly, we carry out fatigue driving experiments to collect EEG signals from eight subjects being alert and fatigue states. Using 2800 samples under within-subject splitting, we compare the effectiveness of ESTCNN with eight competitive methods. The results indicate that ESTCNN fulfills a better classification accuracy of 97.37% than these compared methods. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal structure of this framework advantages in computational efficiency and reference time, which allows further implementations in the brain-computer interface online systems.

However, many relevant studies used traditional wet electrodes to collect EEG signals and the stimulation ways were restricted as music, videos and pictures. This paper provides a new framework for emotion recognition using frontal EEG and VR affective scenes. An experiment about VR stimuli EEG data collection was conducted among 19 subjects. The EEG data were collected using textile dry electrodes. EEG features were extracted from time, frequency and space domain in the collected data. Model stacking method were applied in the experiment to ensemble 3 models including GBDT, RF and SVM. The mean accuracy of our framework achieved about 8130%, which exhibited better performance compared with relevant studies. The framework proposed in this work can be well applied to wearable device for EEG emotion recognition in VR scenes.

However, our increasingly automated world requires us to interact more and more with automated systems, especially in risky environments. The present EEG study aimed at investigating and comparing the neuro-functional correlates associated with performance monitoring of an automated system and a human agent using a vertically-oriented arrowhead version of the flanker task. Given the influence of task difficulty on performance monitoring, two levels of difficulty were considered in order to assess their impact on supervision activity. A large N2-P3 complex in fronto-central regions was observed for both human agent error detection and system error detection during supervision. Using a cluster-based permutation analysis, a significantly decreased P3-like component was found for system compared to human agent error detection. This variation is in line with various psychosocial behavioral studies showing a difference between human-human and human-machine interactions, even though it was not clearly anticipated. Finally, the activity observed during error detection was significantly reduced in the difficult condition compared to the easy one, for both system and human agent supervision. Overall, this study is a first step towards the characterization of the neurophysiological correlates underlying system supervision, and a better understanding of their evolution in more complex environments. To go further, these results need to be replicated in other experiments with various paradigms to assess the robustness of the pattern and decrease during system supervision.

Previous studies have suggested that MI induces partly subject-specific EEG activation patterns, suggesting that individualized classification models should be created. However, due to fatigue of the user, only a limited number of samples can be recorded and, for EEG recordings, each sample is often composed of a large number of features. This combination leads to an undesirable input data set for classification. In order to overcome this constraint, we propose a new methodology to create and select features from the EEG signal in two steps. First, the input data is divided into different windows to reduce the cardinality of the input. Secondly, a Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm is used to select relevant features using a novel fitness function which combines the data reduction with a correlation feature selection measure. The methodology has been tested on EEG oscillatory activity recorded from 6 healthy volunteers while they performed an MI task. Results have successfully proven that a classification above 75% can be obtained in a restrictive amount of time (0.02 s), reducing the number of features by almost 90%.

First, the design, VLSI implementation, and experimental validation of a resource-optimized machine learning algorithm for epilepsy seizure detection are described. Next, the development of a mini-PCB that integrates a low-power wireless data transceiver and a programmable processor for hosting the seizure detection algorithm is discussed. The algorithm uses only EEG signals from the frontal lobe electrodes while yielding a seizure detection sensitivity and specificity competitive to the standard full EEG systems. The experimental validation of the algorithm VLSI implementation proves the possibility of conducting accurate seizure detection using quickly-mountable dry-electrode headsets without the need for uncomfortable/painful through-hair electrodes or adhesive gels. Details of design and optimization of the algorithm, the VLSI implementation, and the mini-PCB development are presented and resource optimization techniques are discussed. The optimized implementation is uploaded on a low-power Microsemi Igloo FPGA, requires 1237 logic elements, consumes 110 $\mu$W dynamic power, and yields a minimum detection latency of 10.2 $\mu$s. The measurement results from the FPGA implementation on data from 23 patients (198 seizures in total) shows a seizure detection sensitivity and specificity of 92.5 and 80.1, respectively. Comparison to the state of the art is presented from system integration, the VLSI implementation, and the wireless communication perspectives.

In the current exploratory study, we have approached this two-group (musicians and nonmusicians) classification problem through a computational framework composed of the following steps: Acoustic features extraction; Acoustic features selection; Trigger selection; EEG signal processing; and Multivariate statistical analysis. We are particularly interested in analyzing the brain data on a global level, considering its activity registered in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals on a given time instant. Our experiment's results-with 26 volunteers (13 musicians and 13 nonmusicians) who listened the classical music Hungarian Dance No. 5 from Johannes Brahms-have shown that is possible to linearly differentiate musicians and nonmusicians with classification accuracies that range from 69.2% (test set) to 93.8% (training set), despite the limited sample sizes available. Additionally, given the whole brain vector navigation method described and implemented here, our results suggest that it is possible to highlight the most expressive and discriminant changes in the participants brain activity patterns depending on the acoustic feature extracted from the audio.

Researchers have designed and built many interfaces and applications in the last couple of decades. BCI is used for prevention, detection, diagnosis, rehabilitation, and restoration in healthcare. EEG signals are analyzed in this paper to help paralyzed people in rehabilitation. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from five healthy subjects are used in this study. The sensor level EEG signals are converted to source signals using the inverse problem solution. Then, the cortical sources are calculated using sLORETA methods at nine regions marked by a neurophysiologist. The features are extracted from cortical sources by using the common spatial pattern (CSP) method and classified by a support vector machine (SVM). Both the sensor and the computed cortical signals corresponding to motor imagery of the hand and foot are used to train the SVM algorithm. Then, the signals outside the training set are used to test the classification performance of the classifier. The 0.1-30 Hz and mu rhythm band-pass filtered activity is also analyzed for the EEG signals. The classification performance and recognition of the imagery improved up to 100% under some conditions for the cortical level. The cortical source signals at the regions contributing to motor commands are investigated and used to improve the classification of motor imagery.

In fractal geometry, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) is a technique to examine the self-similarity of a non-linear, chaotic and noisy time series. EEG signals which are representatives of complex human brain dynamics can be effectively characterised by MDFA. Here, EEG signals representing healthy, interictal and seizure activities are acquired from an available dataset. The acquired signals are at first analysed using MDFA. Based on the multifractal analysis, 14 novel features are proposed in this study, to distinguish between different types of EEG signals. The statistical significance of the selected features is evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis test and is finally served as input feature vector to a support vector machines classifier for the classification of EEG signals. Four classification problems are presented in this work and it is observed that 100% classification accuracy is obtained for three problems which validate the efficacy of the proposed model for computer-aided diagnosis of epilepsy.

Their reliability and robustness are essential to efficiently perform neurotechnological applications in closed-loop. When brain activity is assessed by multichannel recordings, spatial filters computed by the source power comodulation (SPoC) algorithm allow identifying oscillatory subspaces. They regress to a known continuous trial-wise variable reflecting, e.g. stimulus characteristics, cognitive processing or behavior. In small dataset scenarios, this supervised method tends to overfit to its training data as the involved recordings via electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalogram or local field potentials generally provide a low signal-to-noise ratio. To improve upon this, we propose and characterize three types of regularization techniques for SPoC: approaches using Tikhonov regularization (which requires model selection via cross-validation), combinations of Tikhonov regularization and covariance matrix normalization as well as strategies exploiting analytical covariance matrix shrinkage. All proposed techniques were evaluated both in a novel simulation framework and on real-world data. Based on the simulation findings, we saw our expectations fulfilled, that SPoC regularization generally reveals the largest benefit for small training sets and under severe label noise conditions. Relevant for practitioners, we derived operating ranges of regularization hyperparameters for cross-validation based approaches and offer open source code. Evaluating all methods additionally on real-world data, we observed an improved regression performance mainly for datasets from subjects with initially poor performance. With this proof-of-concept paper, we provided a generalizable regularization framework for SPoC which may serve as a starting point for implementing advanced techniques in the future.

J	Pfammatter, JA; Maganti, RK; Jones, MV				Pfammatter, Jesse A.; Maganti, Rama K.; Jones, Mathew, V			An automated, machine learning-based detection algorithm for spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in a mouse model of absence epilepsy	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						animal model; electroencephalogram; machine learning; nonconvulsive; sleep		Objective: Manual detection of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) from electroencephalography (EEG) records is time intensive, costly, and subject to inconsistencies/biases. In addition, manual scoring often omits information on SWD confidence/intensity, which may be important for the investigation of mechanistic-based research questions. Our objective is to develop an automated method for the detection of SWDs in a mouse model of absence epilepsy that is focused on the characteristics of human scoring of preselected events to establish a confidence-based, continuous-valued scoring. Methods: We develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm for the automated detection of SWDs in the.2R43Q mouse model of absence epilepsy. The algorithm first identifies putative SWD events using frequency-and amplitude-based peak detection. Four humans scored a set of 2500 putative events identified by the algorithm. Then, using predictors calculated from the wavelet transform of each event and the labels from human scoring, we trained an SVM to classify (SWD/nonSWD) and assign confidence scores to each event identified from 60, 24-hour EEG records. We provide a detailed assessment of intra- and interrater scoring that demonstrates advantages of automated scoring. Results: The algorithm scored SWDs along a continuum that is highly correlated with human confidence and that allows us to more effectively characterize ambiguous events. We demonstrate that events along our scoring continuum are temporally and proportionately correlated with abrupt changes in spectral power bands relevant to normal behavioral states including sleep. Significance: Although there are automated and semi-automated methods for the detection of SWDs in humans and rats, we contribute to the need for continued development of SWD detection in mice. Our results demonstrate the value of viewing detection of SWDs as a continuous classification problem to better understand "ground truth" in SWD detection (ie, the most reliable features agreed upon by humans that also correlate with objective physiologic measures).

With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning has also been widely used in the field of mental health, e.g., emotion analysis. We propose a feature fusion framework based on convolutional neural network with correlation coefficient matrix and synchronization likelihood matrix of EEG signals for emotion analysis. To further improve the performance, we take the proposed fusion framework as a feature extractor, i.e., taking the output of the layer before softmax as feature, and use stacking strategy for ensemble learning. Experiments on the DEAP database show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The human's different movements are usually investigated by analyzing the movement signals. Based on the literatures, fewer efforts have been made in order to investigate how human movements are represented in the brain. In this paper, we decode the movements' directions of wrist by complexity analysis of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signal. For this purpose, we employ fractal theory. In fact, we investigate how the complexity of MEG signal changes in case of different wrist movements' directions. The results of our analysis showed that MEG signal has different level of complexity in response to different movement's directions. The employed methodology in this research is not limited to the analysis of MEG signal in response to wrist movement, however, it can be applied widely to analyze the influence of different factors (stimuli) on complex structure of other brain signals such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI signals.

Novel drug-independent sedation level estimation based on machine learning of quantitative frontal electroencephalogram features in healthy volunteers	BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						anaesthesia; consciousness monitors; electroencephalogram; machine learning; medical informatics	BISPECTRAL INDEX; EEG; ANESTHESIA; PROPOFOL; DEPTH; ENTROPY; CONSCIOUSNESS; REMIFENTANIL; STATE	Background: Sedation indicators based on a single quantitative EEG (QEEG) feature have been criticised for their limited performance. We hypothesised that integration of multiple QEEG features into a single sedation-level estimator using a machine learning algorithm could reliably predict levels of sedation, independent of the sedative drug used. Methods: In total, 102 subjects receiving propofol (N =36 ; 16 male/20 female), sevoflurane (N =36 ; 16 male/20 female), or dexmedetomidine (N = 30 ; 15 male/15 female) were included in this study of healthy volunteers. Sedation level was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We used 44 QEEG features estimated from the EEG data in a logistic regression algorithm, and an elastic-net regularisation method was used for feature selection. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the logistic regression model. Results: The performances obtained when the system was trained and tested as drug-dependent mode to distinguish between awake and sedated states (mean AUC [standard deviation]) were propofol=0.97 (0.03), sevoflurane=0.74 (0.25), and dexmedetomidine=0.77 (0.10). The drug-independent system resulted in mean AUC=0.83 (0.17) to discriminate between the awake and sedated states. Conclusions: The incorporation of large numbers of QEEG features and machine learning algorithms is feasible for next-generation monitors of sedation level. Different QEEG features were selected for propofol, sevoflurane, and dexmedetomidine groups, but the sedation-level estimator maintained a high performance for predicting MOANS independent of the drug used.

Subjects suffering from AUD are prone to various diseases, psychological and cognitive issues if not identified and treated timely. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used to record the internal structure and activity of the brain. The manual screening of EEG signals for AUD detection is complicated for practitioners because EEG signals are recorded in microvolts (mu v) and consists of the inherent internal complexity of the brain. Therefore, an automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is used for assisting the medical practitioner in AUD screening process. The recorded EEG signals of a subject are nonlinear and oscillatory, and CAD methods examine these signals in their frequency sub-bands. In this paper, flexible analytical wavelets transform (FAWT) based machine learning models are proposed for automated alcoholism detection. In the proposed methodology, EEG signals are decomposed into approximate and detailed wavelet coefficients using FAWT. The statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and Shannon entropy are extracted from the selected wavelet coefficients. The features are fed to the various machine learning models including Least Square-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes learners for training. The training and testing are performed using 10-fold cross-validation. The performance of models is evaluated using all essential measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, precision, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and ROC. The results suggest that LS-SVM using polynomial kernel performed best with accuracy 99.17%, Sensitivity 99.17%, and Specificity as 99.44% using 10-fold cross-validation technique.

There are different biomedical signals including the electroencephalogram (EEG), which is the electrical activity from the brain; the electrocardiogram (ECG), which is the electrical activity from the heart; the electromyogram (EMG), which is the electrical activity from the muscle sound signals; the electroneurogram; the electroretinogram from the eye; and so on (Muthuswamy, Biomedical signal analysis. In: Myer Kutz (ed) Standard handbook of biomedical engineering and design, vol 14. McGraw-Hill Education, New York, pp 1-18. 2004). Biomedical signals are primarily used to diagnose or detect specific pathological or physiological conditions. Additionally, these signals are employed to analyze biological systems in the healthcare. The aims of signal processing are signal denoising, precise recognition of signal model through analysis, feature extraction and dimension reduction for decisive function or dysfunction, and prediction of future functional or pathological events by employing machine learning techniques. The objective of this chapter is to present how biomedical signals are used in the healthcare and what are the steps of biomedical signal analysis.

Pattern recognition using deep learning can extract features of neuroimaging signals unique to various neurological diseases, leading to better diagnoses. In this study, we developed MNet, a novel deep neural network to classify multiple neurological diseases using resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. We used the MEG signals of 67 healthy subjects, 26 patients with spinal cord injury, and 140 patients with epilepsy to train and test the network using 10-fold cross-validation. The trained MNet succeeded in classifying the healthy subjects and those with the two neurological diseases with an accuracy of 70.7 +/- 10.6%, which significantly exceeded the accuracy of 63.4 +/- 12.7% calculated from relative powers of six frequency bands (delta: 1-4 Hz; 0: 4-8 Hz; low-alpha: 8-10 Hz; high-alpha: 10-13 Hz; beta: 13-30 Hz; low-gamma: 30-50 Hz) for each channel using a support vector machine as a classifier (p = 4.2 x 10(-2)). The specificity of classification for each disease ranged from 8694%. Our results suggest that this technique would be useful for developing a classifier that will improve neurological diagnoses and allow high specificity in identifying diseases.

More recently, deep learning has emerged as a promising technique to automatically extract features of raw MI EEG signals and then classify them. However, deep learning-based methods still face two challenging problems in practical MI EEG signal classification applications: (1) Generally, training a deep learning model successfully needs a large amount of labeled data. However, most of the EEG signal data is unlabeled and it is quite difficult or even impossible for human experts to label all the signal samples manually. (2) It is extremely time-consuming and computationally expensive to train a deep learning model from scratch. To cope with these two challenges, a deep transfer convolutional neural network (CNN) framework based on VGG-16 is proposed for EEG signal classification. The proposed framework consists of a VGG-16 CNN model pre-trained on the ImageNet and a target CNN model which shares the same structure with VGG-16 except for the softmax output layer. The parameters of the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN model are directly transferred to the target CNN model used for MI EEG signal classification. Then, front-layers parameters in the target model are frozen, while later-layers parameters are fine-tuned by the target MI dataset. The target dataset is composed of time-frequency spectrum images of EEG signals. The performance of the proposed framework is verified on the public benchmark dataset 2b from the BCI competition IV.

We propose the application of two techniques that significantly improve the accuracy of these estimations and can be combined with a wide range of motor imagery BCI (MI-BCI) methods. The first one scales the observations in such a way that implicitly normalizes the common temporal strength of the source activities. When the scaling applies independently to the trials of the observations, the procedure justifies and improves the classical preprocessing for the EEG data. In addition, when the scaling is instantaneous and independent for each sample, the procedure particularizes to Tyler's method in statistics for obtaining a distribution-free estimate of scattering. In this case, the proposal provides an original interpretation of this existing method as a technique that pursuits an implicit instantaneous power-normalization of the underlying source processes. The second technique applies to the classifier and improves its performance through a convenient regularization of the features covariance matrix. Experimental tests reveal that a combination of the proposed techniques with the state-of-the-art algorithms for motor-imagery classification provides a significant improvement in the classification results.

Sources of interrater variability and prognostic value of standardized EEG features in post-anoxic coma after resuscitated cardiac arrest	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						Cardiac arrest; EEG pattern; Post anoxic coma; Prognosis; Interrater variability; SIRPIDs	ICTAL DISCHARGES SIRPIDS; EUROPEAN-SOCIETY; HYPOTHERMIA; SURVIVORS; COUNCIL	Objectives: To assess interrater variability and prognostic value of simple EEG features based on the recent American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) classification in post cardiac arrest comatose patients. Methods: All patients admitted for a resuscitated cardiac arrest in a university hospital were prospectively included in the study. EEG interpretation was made by 3 independent neurophysiologists (2 senior and 1 junior) blind to the outcome. Kappa score and prognostic performances were estimated for each EEG pattern and discrepancies were analyzed. Results: 122 cardiac arrest patients were admitted of whom 48 went through a full neurologic evaluation. Eighty-one percent had an unfavorable outcome. Burst suppression, paroxystic seizure activity, and non-reactive EEG were strongly associated with an unfavorable evolution. Kappa score between the senior neurophysiologists was excellent or substantial while it was only fair or slight between the junior and senior neurophysiologists. Reactivity, discontinuity and electrographic seizure were patterns particularly subject to discrepancy. Conclusions: Bedside EEG is an excellent tool for predicting outcome of post-anoxic coma through simple EEG features. However, the interrater variability emphasizes the need to be well trained for the standardized methods of evaluating EEG parameters. Significance: A second look at complex patterns seems mandatory. The development of automated tools could help to improve the reliability of EEG interpretation. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In this method, each EEG signal is considered for the FBSE to determine the coefficients then the selected order values of these coefficients are used to obtain the rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). The feature used in this work is WMRPE which has been extracted from rhythms of EEG signal. These computed feature values are then used in distinct classifiers such as random forest (RF), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and regression for classification of epileptic seizure EEG signals. The classification is validated using 10-fold cross-validation technique in order to verify the robustness of the proposed work and the optimization of classification performance has beer implemented with feature ranking methods. The proposed method is also tested with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. In this present work, the proposed method provides better classification accuracy results for seven different classification problems in which six are two-class classification problems and the remaining one is three-class classification problem. In two-class classification problems, the EEG signals of epileptic patients at the time of seizure interval has been classified with six distinct classes of EEG signals i.e., healthy subjects with eyes open condition healthy subjects with eyes closed condition, epileptic patients at the time of seizure-free interval captured from hippocampal formation zone, epileptic patients at the time of seizure-free interval captured from epileptogenic zone, epileptic patients at the time of seizure-free interval, and subjects at the time of non-seizure (healthy and seizure-free) interval. In three-class classification problem, the EEG signals corresponding to epileptic patients during seizure interval, healthy subjects with eyes open condition and epileptic patients at the time of seizure-free interval captured from hippocampal formation zone have been classified with the help of proposed method. The obtained results show that the WMRPE with FBSE based rhythms provides better classification accuracies in comparison to the existing rhythms based method and other existing methods. The proposed method is also perform well in noisy environment at different SNR levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we employed the power spectrum, complexity and bicoherence, biomarker candidates for identifying ADHD children in a machine learning approach, to characterize resting-state EEG (rsEEG). We built support vector machine classifiers using a single type of feature, all features from a method (relative spectral power, spectral power ratio, complexity or bicoherence), or all features from all four methods. We evaluated effectiveness and performance of the classifiers using the permutation test and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We analyzed the rsEEG from 50 ADHD children and 58 age-matched controls. The results show that though spectral features can be used to build a convincing model, the prediction accuracy of the model was unfortunately unstable. Bicoherence features had significant between-group differences, but classifier performance was sensitive to brain region used. rsEEG complexity of ADHD children was significantly lower than controls and may be a suitable biomarker candidate. Through a machine learning approach, 14 features from various brain regions using different methods were selected; the classifier based on these features had an AUC of 0.9158 and an accuracy of 84.59%. These findings strongly suggest that the combination of rsEEG characteristics obtained by various methods may be a tool for identifying ADHD. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

However, it is still performed manually by technical experts and is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To overcome these obstacles in the manual sleep staging process, a large number of machine learning-based classifiers with hand-engineered features have been proposed. Additionally, combinations of a deep neural network (DNN) have been recently highlighted as the state-of-the-art classifiers in view of their effectiveness for automatic sleep staging. In spite of the existence of a large number of these types of classifiers, to-this-date, no prior DNN-based approach has attempted sleep-stage classification using pediatric electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end classifier based on a multi-domain hybrid neural network (HNN-multi) approach consisting of a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory for automatic sleep staging with pediatric scalp EEG recordings. To find effective temporal, spatial, and domain-specific conditions, we investigated noticeable changes in the classification performance corresponding to: 1) the length of input signals; 2) the number of channels; and 3) the types of input signals in the time and frequency domains. Our HNN-based classifier yielded the best performance metrics using 30-s time series in combination with an instantaneous frequency using a 19-channel, three-stage classification, with overall accuracy, F1 score, and Cohen's Kappa, equal to 92.21%, 0.90, and 0.88, respectively. We suggest that an effective combination of temporal and spatial time-domain clues with time-varying frequency domain information plays a pivotal role in pediatric, automatic sleep staging. Sufficiently reasonable performance of our HNN-based approach coping with the highly complicated pediatric EEG signatures hopefully sheds light on the clinical feasibility of the DNN-based automatic sleep staging for pediatric neurology.

To tackle this problem, we propose the possibility of modeling consumer experience using psychophysiological measures and demonstrate how such models can be trained using machine learning methods. We use a machine learning approach to model user experience using real-time data produced by the autonomic nervous system and involuntary psychophysiological responses. Multiple psychophysiological measures, such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory activity, have been used in combination with self-reporting to prepare training sets for machine learning algorithms. The training data was collected from 31 participants during hour-long experiment sessions, where they played multiple video-games. Afterwards, we trained and compared the results of four different machine learning models, out of which the best one produced approximate to 96% accuracy. The results suggest that psychophysiological measures can indeed be used to assess the enjoyment of digital entertainment consumers.

Wavelet analysis is a powerful technique that uniquely permits the decomposition of complex information of trends, discontinuities, a repeated pattern. The purpose of such methods is to be able to assign simple segments at diverse locations and scales, to be remodelled afterward effectively. In this paper, we attempt to classify individual cognitive learning styles using artificial neural networks and unsupervised learning. First, we apply Independent component analysis (ICA) to extract relevant features (artefacts removal) of the EEG records. We analyse the ICA-based EEG channels data using inter-quartiles to show the degree of dispersion and skewness.

J	Ehrlich, SK; Cheng, G				Ehrlich, Stefan K.; Cheng, Gordon			A Feasibility Study for Validating Robot Actions Using EEG-Based Error-Related Potentials	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Passive brain-computer interface (BCI); Error-related potentials (ErrP); Event-related potentials (ERP); Error monitoring; Human-robot interaction (HRI)	ERP COMPONENTS; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; ATTENTION; CORTEX; P600	Validating human-robot interaction can be a challenging task, especially in cases in which the robot designer is interested in the assessment of individual robot actions within an ongoing interaction that should not be interrupted by intermittent surveys. In this paper, we propose a neuro-based method for real-time quantitative assessment of robot actions. The method encompasses the decoding of error-related potentials (ErrPs) from the electroencephalogram (EEG) of a human during interaction with a robot, which could be a useful and intuitive complement to existing methods for validating human-robot interaction in the future. To demonstrate usability, we conducted a study in which we examined EEG-based ErrPs in response to a humanoid robot displaying semantically incorrect actions in a simplistic HRI task. Furthermore, we conducted a procedurally identical control experiment with computer screen-based symbolic cursor action. The results of our study confirmed decodeability of ErrPs in response to incorrect robot actions with an average accuracy of 69.0 +/- 7.9% across 11 subjects. Cross-comparisons of ErrPs between experimental tasks revealed high temporal and topographical similarity, but more distinct signals in response to the cursor action and, as a result, better decodeability with a mean accuracy of 90.6 +/- 3.9%. This demonstrated that ErrPs can be sensitive to the stimulus eliciting them despite procedurally identical protocols. Re-using ErrP-decoders across experimental tasks without re-calibration is accompanied by significant performance losses and therefore not recommended. Overall, the outcomes of our study confirm feasibility of ErrP-decoding for human-robot validation, but also highlight challenges to overcome in order to enhance usability of the proposed method.

J	Aydemir, O; Ergun, E				Aydemir, Onder; Ergun, Ebru			A robust and subject-specific sequential forward search method for effective channel selection in brain computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Channel selection; Feature extraction; Classification	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; EEG SIGNALS; MOTOR-IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT; ALGORITHM	Background: The input signals of electroencephalography (EEG) based brain computer interfaces (BCI) are extensively acquired from scalp with a multi-channel system. However, multi-channel signals might contain redundant information and increase computational complexity. Furthermore, using only effective channels, rather than all channels, may enhance the performance of the BCI in terms of classification accuracy (CA). New method: We proposed a robust and subject-specific sequential forward search method (RSS-SFSM) for effective channel selection (ECS). The ECS procedure executes a sequential search among each of the candidate channels in order to find the channels which maximize the CA performance of the validation set. It should be noted that in order to avoid the problems of random selections in the validation set, we applied the ECS procedure for 100 times. Then, the total numbers of the selection of each channel present the effective ones. To demonstrate its reliability and robustness, the proposed method was applied to two data sets. Results: The achieved results showed that the proposed method not only improved the average CA by 15.98%, but also decreased the considered number of channels and computational complexity by 71.53% on average. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with the existing methods, we achieved better results in terms of both the classification accuracy improvement and channel reduction rates. Conclusions: Features extracted by Hilbert transform and sum derivative methods were effectively classified by support vector machine. In conclusion, the results obtained proved that the RSS-SFSM shows great potential for determining effective channel(s).

The proposal consists of two main stages: feature extraction and pattern classification. The EEG signals used represent four motor imagery tasks: Left Hand, Right Hand, Foot and Tongue movements. In addition, one more class was added: Rest. These EEG signals were obtained from a database provided by the Technological University of Graz. Feature extraction stage was carried out by applying two algorithms: Power Spectral Density and Wavelet Decomposition. The tested algorithms were: K-Nearest Neighbors, Multilayer Perceptron, Single Spiking Neuron and Spiking Neural Network. All of them were evaluated in the classification between two Motor Imagery tasks; all possible pairings were made with the 5 mental tasks (Rest, Left Hand, Right Hand, Tongue and Foot).

We provide an updated view of the cortical origins of evoked responses and discuss potential mechanisms contributing to ERP generation. In particular, we focus on the relationship between evoked and ongoing oscillatory activity and discuss the differences between ERPs and cortical activation as indexed by high-frequency activity in human intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). We highlight several possibilities for how ERPs can precisely index human perception and behavior in nontraditional approaches, such as neuronal entrainment through steady-state evoked potentials, multivariate decoding, and cross-frequency correlations. We argue that analyses of time-locked responses are beneficial to assess nonlinear and nonsinusoidal neuronal activity on a fine-grained temporal scale, since analyses in the time domain are less susceptible to artifacts than spectral decomposition techniques. Taken together, the current review provides a state-of-the-art overview of ERPs and their application in cognitive and clinical neurophysiology.

Lower gamma band in the classification of left and right elbow movement in real and imaginary tasks	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Machine learning; Gamma band; Brain-computer interfaces; Rehabilitation robotics	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; (DE)SYNCHRONIZATION ERD/ERS; EEG; IMAGERY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; POWER	In this article, the activity of lower gamma band was used to classify right and left elbow movements performed from real and imaginary tasks in two different cognitive states: the preparation and the movement execution. Discriminability maps were used both to generalize the signal behavior of all the volunteers and to select time intervals of high discrimination among classes. The features extracted from chosen intervals were tested in eight different classification algorithms. To improve classes discrimination, LDA was used for dimensional reduction. Algorithms were tested using a fivefold cross-validation. The results showed similar signal activity for both real and imaginary actions, obtaining closer classification responses among all volunteers. The tested algorithm gave a mean classification success up to 70%, with minor differences between the type of task and the cognitive state.	[Veslin, E. Y.; Dutra, M.

Older adults' poorer speech-in-noise (SIN) comprehension has been related to abnormal neural representations within various nodes (regions) of the speech network, but how senescent changes in hearing alter the transmission of brain signals remains unspecified. We measured electroencephalograms in older adults with and without mild hearing loss during a SIN identification task. Using functional connectivity and graph-theoretic analyses, we show that hearing-impaired (HI) listeners have more extended (less integrated) communication pathways and less efficient information exchange among widespread brain regions (larger network eccentricity) than their normal-hearing (NH) peers. Parameter optimized support vector machine classifiers applied to EEG connectivity data showed hearing status could be decoded (> 85% accuracy) solely using network-level descriptions of brain activity, but classification was particularly robust using left hemisphere connections. Notably, we found a reversal in directed neural signaling in left hemisphere dependent on hearing status among specific connections within the dorsal-ventral speech pathways. NH listeners showed an overall net "bottom-up" signaling directed from auditory cortex (A1) to inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; Broca's area), whereas the HI group showed the reverse signal (i.e., "top-down" Broca's -> A1). A similar flow reversal was noted between left IFG and motor cortex. Our full-brain connectivity results demonstrate that even mild forms of hearing loss alter how the brain routes information within the auditory-linguistic-motor loop.

J	Rahul, Y; Sharma, RK				Rahul, Yumlembam; Sharma, Rupam Kumar			EEG signal-based movement control for mobile robots	CURRENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; machine learning; brain-computer interface; neural networks	WHEELCHAIR; BCI	Although wheelchair with joystick control is available, people whose hands are paralysed cannot use the joystick and need other forms of assistance to move. This article presents the design and analysis of a mobile prototype robot control using a single-electrode commercial electroencephalogram (EEG) headset. We examine the possibility of detecting P300 and blink signal for use as an input to control a prototype robot. From the captured EEG signals, P300 and non-P300 are classified using an artificial neural network. In another experiment, we classify signals captured during the intentional blink of the eye and signals where there is no blink. Also, we classify when the user intentionally blinks two, three and four times. From the experiments, we found that P300 cannot be successfully detected with a single dry electrode on Fp1 position. Additionally, we found that signals which contain blink and those which do not contain blink can be classified using an artificial neural network. We also found that different number of blinks can be classified using an artificial neural network. Different number of blinks is used to move forward, turn left and right.

There is an increasing interest in using EEG analysis to detect seizure, and in this study we aim to get a better understanding of how to visualize the information in the EEG time-frequency feature, and design and train a novel random forest algorithm for EEG decoding, especially for multiple-levels of illness. Here, we propose an automatic detection framework for epileptic seizure based on multiple time-frequency analysis approaches; it involves a novel random forest model combined with grid search optimization. The short-time Fourier transformation visualizes seizure features after normalization. The dimensionality of features is reduced through principal component analysis before feeding them into the classification model. The training parameters are optimized using grid search optimization to improve detection performance and diagnostic accuracy by in the recognition of three different levels epileptic of conditions (healthy subjects, seizure-free intervals, seizure activity). Our proposed model was used to classify 500 samples of raw EEG data, and multiple cross-validations were adopted to boost the modeling accuracy. Experimental results were evaluated by an accuracy, a confusion matrix, a receiver operating characteristic curve, and an area under the curve. The evaluations indicated that our model achieved the more effective classification than some previous typical methods. Such a scheme for computer-assisted clinical diagnosis of seizures has a potential guiding significance, which not only relieves the suffering of patient with epilepsy to improve quality of life, but also helps neurologists reduce their workload.

A great challenge in using EEG data for BrainComputer Interface (BCI) algorithms is its poor generalization performance across users. Taking advantage of these inter-user differences, we investigate the potential in using this technology for user authentication - similar to facial recognition in smartphones. Additionally, we evaluate this in combination with eye tracking data which is also readily available in such headsets. We develop a biometric authentication systems for each of these systems and for their fusion. We formulate a novel evaluation paradigm using publicly available EEG motor imagery and eye tracking data and demonstrate strong feasibility towards using EEG and eye tracking for authentication.

One of the leading reasons that make migraine a bigger issue is that it cannot be diagnosed easily by physicians because of the numerous overlapping symptoms with other diseases, such as epilepsy and tension-headache. Consequently, studies have been growing on how to make a computerized decision support system for diagnosis of migraine. In most laboratory studies, flash stimulation is used during the recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with different frequencies and variable (seconds) time windows. The main contribution of this study is the investigation of the effects of flash stimulation on the classification accuracy, and how to find the effective window length for EEG signal classification. To achieve this, we tested different machine learning algorithms on the EEG signals features extracted by using discrete wavelet transform. Our tests on the real-world dataset, recorded in the laboratory, show that the flash stimulation can improve the classification accuracy for more than 10%. Not surprisingly, it is seen that the same holds for the selection of time window length, i.e. the selection of the proper window length is crucial for the accurate migraine identification.

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) in image processing and long-short term memory (LSTM) in the time-series analysis are commonly used deep learning algorithms. Healthcare applications of deep learning algorithms provide important contributions for computer-aided diagnosis research. In this study, convolutional long-short term memory (CLSTM) network was used for automatic classification of EEG signals and automatic seizure detection. Methods: A new nine-layer deep network model consisting of convolutional and LSTM layers was designed. The signals processed in the convolutional layers were given as an input to the LSTM network whose outputs were processed in densely connected neural network layers. The EEG data is appropriate for a model having 1-D convolution layers. A bidirectional model was employed in the LSTM layer. Results: Bonn University EEG database with five different datasets was used for experimental studies. In this database, each dataset contains 23.6 s duration 100 single channel EEG segments which consist of 4097 dimensional samples (173.61 Hz). Eight two-class and three three-class clinical scenarios were examined. When the experimental results were evaluated, it was seen that the proposed model had high accuracy on both binary and ternary classification tasks. Conclusions: The proposed end-to-end learning structure showed a good performance without using any hand-crafted feature extraction or shallow classifiers to detect the seizures. The model does not require filtering, and also automatically learns to filter the input as well. As a result, the proposed model can process long duration EEG signals without applying segmentation, and can detect epileptic seizures automatically by using the correlation of ictal and interictal signals of raw data.

Numerous works have attempted to develop tools that can provide an assistant to neurophysiologist in analyzing the EEG for epileptic seizures detection. This paper proposes a new automatic framework to identify and classify the epileptic seizure from EEG using a machine learning method. In particular, the feature extraction process of the proposed scheme utilizes autoregressive model (AR) and firefly optimization (FA) to procure an optimal model order (P). Namely, the main aim of FA is to find the best model order (P) with minimum residual variance using Akaike information criterion (AIC) as an objective function of FA algorithm. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed for the classification of the epileptic seizures signals. The presented scheme is also effective for short segment of EEG signals owing to use of AR model in features extraction stage. Experiments with the publicly available Bonn database that is composed of healthy (nonepileptic), interictal and ictal EEG samples show promising results with high accuracy.

It is proven to have positive effect on learning and academic achievement. Nonetheless, not much attention is given for assessing the feasibility of detecting this interest in natural classroom physiologically. Therefore, this study investigates the possibility of detecting situational interest using Electroencephalogram (EEG) in classroom. After preprocessing of EEG data, they were decomposed using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The resulted Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) were ranked based on their significance using T-test and Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) in descending order. A matrix was constructed for all participants using the best six features from four EEG channels. These selected features were fed into Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers with 10 cross validation. While SVM achieved high accuracy of 93.3% and 87.5% for two data sets using features from the four EEG channels, KNN classifier achieved high accuracy of 87.5% and 86.7% in the same datasets using single EEG channel. It is found that gamma and delta bands can be used successfully to detect situational interest of students during learning in classrooms. Furthermore, data of single EEG channel - F3 in this study- was efficient to detect student's situational interest in simultaneous recording of EEG in classroom.

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a promising spatial filtering technique in BCI system for it requires few and unlabeled training samples for calibration of the BCI system. However, both the distribution of scalp electrodes and the quality of training data are critical factors of influencing the classification performance of ICA-BCI applications. In this study, a new channel selection algorithm was proposed for automatically choosing subject-specific minimal electrode subsets that can obtain high classification accuracies of the ICA-BCI system. The algorithm consisted of two steps: selection of "main electrodes" located on the motor cortex, and subsequent searching of "subordinate electrodes", which were picked out one by one from the left electrodes until the maximum accuracy was achieved. Meanwhile, a single_trial_based_self_testing (STST) method, utilizing one single trial to train ICA spatial filters which were only applied in the identical trial for extracting motor-related independent components (MRICs), was proposed to eliminate the influence of bad trials. The channel selection algorithm was applied in 72 runs of three-class motor imagery EEG datasets for twelve BCE users. Experimental results indicated that the classification accuracies using the optimal channels were significantly higher than that of standard 8 and 9 channels. Meanwhile, ICA algorithm with optimal channel subset had comparable performance with Common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm in self-testing and run-to-run cross validation, and ICA significantly outperformed CSP in session-to-session and subject-to-subject transfer. Although the numbers and locations of optimal channels were different between sessions and subjects, the main electrodes were basically same between different runs for long-term BCI users. Furthermore, the optimal electrodes were primarily located on the motor cortex of parietal lobe area and the frontal lobe area, few located in the occipital lobe area. Too many or too few channels were not suitable for ICA calculation, and usually, using 5-8 channels of EEG data could achieve better classification performance. These findings may offer a reference for the optimization of ICA-based BCI systems, and further improve the performance and stability of MI-BCI system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the estimated independent sources have to be further classified by an expert using predefined or learned features. Automatic algorithms on market suffer from unsatisfactory sensitivity and specificity mostly due to large inter-subject variability of the human EEG. Generalization of each learning machine depends on whether some discriminative features exist in inter and intra individual component space. We employ nonlinear dimension reduction technique called t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to fit the data and visualize them in estimated feature space. Our approach is unsupervised and completely data driven. We focus on regularities in a real-world hdEEG component set that could be learned by robust feature classifier, e.g. a deep network. Furthermore, we also investigate relations between found data structure and commonly used criteria known from the literature.

SPINDLE: End-to-end learning from EEG/EMG to extrapolate animal sleep scoring across experimental settings, labs and species	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; MODEL; MICE	Understanding sleep and its perturbation by environment, mutation, or medication remains a central problem in biomedical research. Its examination in animal models rests on brain state analysis via classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures. Traditionally, these states are classified by trained human experts by visual inspection of raw EEG recordings, which is a laborious task prone to inter-individual variability. Recently, machine learning approaches have been developed to automate this process, but their generalization capabilities are often insufficient, especially across animals from different experimental studies. To address this challenge, we crafted a convolutional neural network-based architecture to produce domain invariant predictions, and furthermore integrated a hidden Markov model to constrain state dynamics based upon known sleep physiology. Our method, which we named SPINDLE (Sleep Phase Identification with Neural networks for Domain-invariant LEearning) was validated using data of four animal cohorts from three independent sleep labs, and achieved average agreement rates of 99%, 98%, 93%, and 97% with scorings from five human experts from different labs, essentially duplicating human capability. It generalized across different genetic mutants, surgery procedures, recording setups and even different species, far exceeding state-of-the-art solutions that we tested in parallel on this task. Moreover, we show that these scored data can be processed for downstream analyzes identical to those from human-scored data, in particular by demonstrating the ability to detect mutation-induced sleep alteration. We provide to the scientific community free usage of SPINDLE and benchmarking datasets as an online server at https://sleeplearning.ethz.ch. Our aim is to catalyze high-throughput and well-standardized experimental studies in order to improve our understanding of sleep. Author summary Machine learning-based approaches hold great promise to pave the way for high-throughput animal sleep monitoring. With the novel developments of gene-engineering techniques and the proliferation of experimental sleep studies, the need for the automation and cross-lab standardization of sleep scoring becomes more imminent. Traditionally, the classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures is done by trained human experts via visual inspection. Here we present a novel algorithm based upon neural networks to automatically generate accurate and physiologically plausible predictions. Performed experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution offers de facto human level performance, is more accurate than any other approach to date (93-99% accurate compared to multiple trained human scorers), and functions across different genetic mutants, surgery procedures, recording setups and even different species. Moreover, our method was capable of detecting mutation-induced changes in sleeping patterns. To allow for its widespread adaptation, we make our framework freely available through the provision of an online server and an easy to use interface. This community tool will both contribute to the standardization of experimental studies and enhance scientific understanding of sleep.

Numerous methods of attention level detection such as observation, self-assessment, and objective performance have been applied especially in supervised machine learning. But those methods tend to be delayed, sporadic, not at the moment in time, and based on participant cognitive ability. This study proposed a new labeling method for attention level detection by using quantitative evaluation formula based on blink rates and pupillometry. Comparison in error detection between self-assessment, observation, and objective performance has been done in this study. After that, this study investigated the effect of attention level based on self-assessment toward blink rates and pupillometry. The result shown blink rates in low attention is higher than high attention. On the other hand, pupillometry in low attention is smaller than high attention. The effect of attention levels toward pupillometry and blink rates are extracted into several algorithms. The result from experimental procedure shown quantitative evaluation formula has percentage error less than 15% compared with self-assessment. Overall, these results demonstrated that the proposed method can be used to be data labeling for other physiological signals such as electroencephalograph (EEG), electrocardiograph (ECG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). After that, this quantitative formula was applied to EEG-ECG-NIRS for attention level detection. Two-electrode wireless EEG, a wireless ECG, and two wireless channels NIRS has been used to detect attention level during tasks load. Our result has shown the accuracy system 82.31%.

Traditionally, clinical EEG has been analyzed in terms of temporal waveforms, looking at rhythms in spontaneous activity, subjectively identifying troughs and peaks in Event-Related Potentials (ERP), or by studying graphoelements in pathological sleep stages. Additionally, the discipline of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) requires new methods to decode patterns from non-invasive EEG signals. This field is developing alternative communication pathways to transmit volitional information from the Central Nervous System. The technology could potentially enhance the quality of life of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders and other mental illness. This work mimics what electroencephalographers have been doing clinically, visually inspecting, and categorizing phenomena within the EEG by the extraction of features from images of signal plots. These features are constructed based on the calculation of histograms of oriented gradients from pixels around the signal plot. It aims to provide a new objective framework to analyze, characterize and classify EEG signal waveforms. The feasibility of the method is outlined by detecting the P300, an ERP elicited by the oddball paradigm of rare events, and implementing an offline P300-based BCI Speller. The validity of the proposal is shown by offline processing a public dataset of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and an own dataset of healthy subjects.

The prevalence and prognostic importance of a dissociation between commanded motor behavior and brain activation in the first few days after brain injury are not well understood. MethodsWe studied a prospective, consecutive series of patients in a single intensive care unit who had acute brain injury from a variety of causes and who were unresponsive to spoken commands, including some patients with the ability to localize painful stimuli or to fixate on or track visual stimuli. Machine learning was applied to EEG recordings to detect brain activation in response to commands that patients move their hands. The functional outcome at 12 months was determined with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E; levels range from 1 to 8, with higher levels indicating better outcomes). ResultsA total of 16 of 104 unresponsive patients (15%) had brain activation detected by EEG at a median of 4 days after injury. The condition in 8 of these 16 patients (50%) and in 23 of 88 patients (26%) without brain activation improved such that they were able to follow commands before discharge. At 12 months, 7 of 16 patients (44%) with brain activation and 12 of 84 patients (14%) without brain activation had a GOS-E level of 4 or higher, denoting the ability to function independently for 8 hours (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 17.1). ConclusionsA dissociation between the absence of behavioral responses to motor commands and the evidence of brain activation in response to these commands in EEG recordings was found in 15% of patients in a consecutive series of patients with acute brain injury.

The majority of the previous work in BCI use spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal features of event-related potentials (ERPs). In this study, we examined the discriminatory effect of their spatiospectral features to capture the most relevant set of neural activities from electroencephalographic recordings that represent users' mental intent. In this regard, we model ERP waveforms using a sum of sinusoids with unknown amplitudes, frequencies, and phases. The effect of this signal modeling step is to represent high-dimensional ERP waveforms in a substantially lower dimensionality space, which includes their dominant power spectral contents. We found that the most discriminative frequencies for accurate decoding of visual attention modulated ERPs lie in a spectral range less than 6.4 Hz. This was empirically verified by treating dominant frequency contents of ERP waveforms as feature vectors in the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques used herein. The constructed predictive models achieved remarkable performance, which for some subjects was as high as 94% as measured by the area under curve. Using these spectral contents, we further studied the discriminatory effect of each channel and proposed an efficient strategy to choose subject-specific subsets of channels that generally led to classifiers with comparable performance.

This research presents an EEG processing method, which is capable of detecting patterns of the subject's motor imagery, splitting the patters in left or right hand imagery. The proposed method considers the Round Cosine Transform (RCT), a low computational complexity transform, and an artificial neural network (ANN) module which identifies the patterns. The method has been tested in a real-time (RT) continuous EEG processing experiment simulation, controlling a mouse arrow horizontally on a screen based on the subject's imagery motor activity. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of the mutual information (MI), classification time and misclassification rate (%).

However, the study of these modulations after cognitive practice, resulting from a memory task, has been scarce. This work aims at examining age-related changes in the functional reorganization of the resting brain after cognitive training, namely, neuroplasticity, by means of the most innovative tools for data analysis. To this end, electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 34 young and 38 older participants. Different methods for data analyses, including frequency, time-frequency and machine learning-based prediction models were conducted. Results showed reductions in Alpha power in old compared to young adults in electrodes placed over posterior and anterior areas of the brain. Moreover, young participants showed Alpha power increases after task performance, while their older counterparts exhibited a more invariant pattern of results. These results were significant in the 140-160 s time window in electrodes placed over anterior regions of the brain. Machine learning analyses were able to accurately classify participants by age, but failed to predict whether resting state scans took place before or after the memory task. These findings greatly contribute to the development of multivariate tools for electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis and improve our understanding of age-related changes in the functional reorganization of the resting brain.

Seizure is harmful during various events like swimming or driving. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the measurement of electrical activity received from the nerve cells of the cerebral cortex. Forthcoming seizures can be predicted from scalp EEG signal to improve the quality of life. The study proposes a method of automatic epileptic seizure prediction from raw EEG signal. The raw EEG signal is converted into EEG signal image for automatic extraction of features and classification of inter-ictal and pre-ictal state using Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet). This classification process is carried out in a manner similar to the process followed by a medical practitioner without resorting to hand-crafted features. The public CHB-MIT EEG database is used for training, validation, and testing. An EEG signal for 1 second duration is taken as one sample. The accuracy for the classification of inter-ictal and pre-ictal state is achieved up to 94% by using 5-Fold cross validation. However, the accuracy is not up to the mark for the presence of common artifacts caused by eye-blinking and muscle activities during EEG recordings. Hence, a 30 seconds pool based technique is used for decision on correct state identification. The proposed pool based technique provides an average specificity of 95.87% and a false prediction rate of 0.0413/hour. It also provide average sensitivities of 100%, 97%, and 90% for the time slots 0 - 5 minutes, 5 - 10 minutes, and 10 - 15 minutes before the seizure event.

Variations of such connectivity patterns between different cognitive tasks can be evaluated using pairwise synchronization measures applied to electrophysiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG). However, connectivity-based task recognition approaches achieving viable recognition performance have been lacking from the literature. By using several synchronization measures, we identify time lags between channel pairs during different cognitive tasks. We employed mutual information, cross correntropy, cross correlation, phase locking value, cosine similarity and nonlinear interdependence measures. In the training phase, for each type of cognitive task, we identify the time lags that maximize the average synchronization between channel pairs. These lags are used to calculate pairwise synchronization values with which we construct the train and test feature vectors for recognition of the cognitive task carried out using Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) analysis. We tested our framework in a motor imagery activity recognition scenario on PhysioNet Motor Movement/Imagery and BCI Competition-III IVa datasets. For PhysioNet dataset, average performance results ranging between % 51 and % 61 across 20 subjects. For BCI Competition-III dataset, we achieve an average recognition performance of % 76 which is above the minimum reliable communication rate (% 70). We achieved an average accuracy over the minimum reliable communication rate on the BCI Competition-III dataset. Performance levels were lower on the PhysioNet dataset. These results indicate that a viable task recognition system is achievable using pairwise synchronization measures evaluated at the proper task specific lags.	[Olcay, B.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) can record the electrical activity of the brain and is extensively used to analyze and diagnose epileptic seizures. However, the EEG signals are highly non-linear and chaotic and are difficult to analyze due to their small magnitude. Hence, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a non-linear technique, has been widely adopted to capture the subtle changes present in the EEG signals. Hence, it is an added advantage to develop an automated computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system to detect the different brain activities from the EEG signals using machine learning approaches. In this paper, we focus on the previous works which have used the EMD technique in the automated detection of normal or epileptic EEG signals.	[Bairy, G.

Our model combines fixed point quantization and cost-efficient inference to enable low-power embedded learning. Testing this model on the intracranial EEG data from 14 epilepsy patients, we can reduce the feature extraction cost by 53.1% and quantize the leaf weights with 4 bits, while maintaining the seizure detection performance.

EEG is useful to distinguish between left arm and right arm movements, however, it is difficult to classify the different movements on one arm. In this paper, a two-step single-trial classification method is proposed to recognize three movements (make a fist, hand extension and elbow flexion) of left and right arms: (1) distinguish between left arm and right arm movements by decoding event-related (de) synchronization (ERD/ERS) and (2) recognize the specific movement of this arm using corticomuscular coherence as features. Four healthy subjects are employed in a cue-based motor execution (ME) experiment. In Step one, ERD and post-movement ERS are found over the contralateral sensorimotor area; in Step two, for each movement, only the beta-band coherence between C3/C4 and the corresponding agonistic muscle is significant. The classification results show the best accuracy of Step one and Step two is 88.10% and 93.33%, respectively. This proposed method achieves a total accuracy of 82.22%. This study demonstrates that our method is effective to classify different movements on one arm, and provides the theoretic basis and technical support for the practical development of BMI-based motor restoration applications.

Research in environmental psychology and neuroscience indicates distinct architectural design features ( e.g., color coding, texture, and space layouts, etc.) impact human performance and motivation to work in office spaces. In the current practice, occupants evaluate work space designs via after-the-fact post-construction surveys subjectively. Limited studies exist in the literature on objectively quantifying motivational impact of space design on occupants. This research stems from the need for having objective ways to assess human experience in the built environment for design improvement. Integration of electro-encephalograph ( EEG) and virtual reality ( VR) equips researchers with the tools to measure human responses when subjects are immersed in alternative virtual designed spaces. This study proposed a machine learning based method to label subjects' experience in spaces using their EEG data collected when they were in distinctly designed spaces. Results showed this method provided around 85% classification accuracy, which is comparable to other state-of-the-art EEG classification methods. Practitioners in the architecture engineering and construction ( AEC) domain can use this method to identify if proposed design options have positive or negative impacts on future occupants.

This study proposes an automatic sleepiness classification scheme designed using data from 30 drivers who repeatedly drove in a high-fidelity driving simulator, both in alert and in sleep deprived conditions. Driver sleepiness classification was performed using four separate classifiers: k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, case-based reasoning, and random forest, where physiological signals and contextual information were used as sleepiness indicators. The subjective Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) was used as target value. An extensive evaluation on multiclass and binary classifications was carried out using 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out validation. With 10-fold cross-validation, the support vector machine showed better performance than the other classifiers (79% accuracy for multiclass and 93% accuracy for binary classification). The effect of individual differences was also investigated, showing a 10% increase in accuracy when data from the individual being evaluated was included in the training dataset. Overall, the support vector machine was found to be the most stable classifier. The effect of adding contextual information to the physiological features improved the classification accuracy by 4% in multiclass classification and by and 5% in binary classification.

Untangling featural and conceptual object representations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							NEURAL RESPONSE; CATEGORY REPRESENTATIONS; PREDICT PATTERNS; VISUAL FEATURES; ANIMACY; BRAIN; EEG; ORGANIZATION; RECOGNITION; SIMILARITY	How are visual inputs transformed into conceptual representations by the human visual system? The contents of human perception, such as objects presented on a visual display, can reliably be decoded from voxel activation patterns in fMRI, and in evoked sensor activations in MEG and EEG. A prevailing question is the extent to which brain activation associated with object categories is due to statistical regularities of visual features within object categories. Here, we assessed the contribution of mid-level features to conceptual category decoding using EEG and a novel fast periodic decoding paradigm. Our study used a stimulus set consisting of intact objects from the animate (e.g., fish) and inanimate categories (e.g., chair) and scrambled versions of the same objects that were unrecognizable and preserved their visual features (Long et al., 2018). By presenting the images at different periodic rates, we biased processing to different levels of the visual hierarchy. We found that scrambled objects and their intact counterparts elicited similar patterns of activation, which could be used to decode the conceptual category (animate or inanimate), even for the unrecognizable scrambled objects. Animacy decoding for the scrambled objects, however, was only possible at the slowest periodic presentation rate. Animacy decoding for intact objects was faster, more robust, and could be achieved at faster presentation rates. Our results confirm that the mid-level visual features preserved in the scrambled objects contribute to animacy decoding, but also demonstrate that the dynamics vary markedly for intact versus scrambled objects. Our findings suggest a complex interplay between visual feature coding and categorical representations that is mediated by the visual system's capacity to use image features to resolve a recognisable object.

A New Design of Mental State Classification for Subject Independent BCI Systems	IRBM			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Brain-computer interface (BCI); Motor Imagery (MI); Subject Independent (SI); Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; EEG	Background: Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems have been widely used to develop sustainable assistive technology for people suffering from neurological impairments. A major limitation of current BCI systems is that they are based on Subject-dependent (SD) concept. The SD based BCI system is time consuming and inconvenient for physical or mental disables people and also not suitable for limited computer resources. In order to overcome these problems, recently subject-independent (SI) based BCI concept has been introduced to identify mental states of motor disabled people but the expected outcome of the SI based BCI has not been achieved yet. Hence this paper intends to present an efficient scheme for SI based BCI system. The goal of this research is to develop a method for classifying mental states which can be used by any user. For attaining this target, this study employs a supervised spatial filtering method with four types of feature extraction methods including Katz Fractal Dimension, Sub band Energy, Log Variance and Root Mean Square (RMS) and finally the obtained features are used as input to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification model for identifying mental states for SI BCI system. Results: The performance of the proposed design is evaluated in several ways such as considering different time window length; different frequency bands; different number of channels. The mean classification accuracy using Katz feature is 84.35% which is the maximum output compare to other features that outperforms the existing methods.

Segmenting these signals, extracting features to obtain the important properties of the signal and classification are key aspects of detecting epileptic seizures. Despite the introduction of several techniques, it is very challenging when multiple EEG channels are involved. When many channels exist, a spatial filter is required to eliminate noise and extract relevant information. This adds a new dimension of complexity to the frequency feature space. In order to stabilize the classifier of the channels, feature selection is very important. Furthermore, and to improve the performance of a classifier, more data is required from EEG channels for complex problems. The increase of such data poses some challenges as it becomes difficult to identify the subject dependent bands when the channels increase. Hence, an automated process is required for such identification. The proposed approach in this work tends to tackle the multiple EEG channels problem by segmenting the EEG signals in the frequency domain based on changing spikes rather than the traditional time based windowing approach. While to reduce the overall dimensionality and preserve the class-dependent features an optimization approach is used. This process of selecting an optimal feature subset is an optimization problem. Thus, we propose an adaptive multi-parent crossover Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing the features used in classifying epileptic seizures. The GA-based approach is used to optimize the various features obtained. It encodes the temporal and spatial filter estimates and optimize the feature selection with respect to the classification error. The classification was done using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed technique was evaluated using the publicly available epileptic seizure data from the machine learning repository of the UCI center for machine learning and intelligent systems. The proposed approach outperforms other ones and achieved a high level of accuracy. These results, indicate the ability of a multi-parent crossover GA in optimizing the feature selection process in EEG classification. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The online brain-computer interface is based on steady-state visually evoked potentials, which employs the multivariate synchronization index classification algorithm to decode the human electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. In this way, human intentions can be recognized and EEG control commands can be produced for the mobile robot. Besides, a novel artificial potential function named QPF is designed to produce the potential fields to parameterize the EEG control commands. The classification results of the EEG signal are related to the distribution of the potential fields, and the collision-free path to a target position is automatically planned by the potential field. Such semi-automatic design builds the direct mapping from human intentions to the mobile robot's behavior and reduces mental effort or exhaustion on subject's part. Besides, based on the QPF with the capability of handling nonholonomic constraints, the integrated system can not only achieve obstacle avoidance but is also able to automatically stabilize the robot to a target configuration. Extensive experiment studies were conducted on several subjects to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Comparison of Two-Talker Attention Decoding from EEG with Nonlinear Neural Networks and Linear Methods	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							AUDITORY ATTENTION; ATTENDED SPEECH; HEARING-LOSS; ENVIRONMENT; TRACKING; SPEAKER	Auditory attention decoding (AAD) through a brain-computer interface has had a flowering of developments since it was first introduced by Mesgarani and Chang (2012) using electrocorticograph recordings. AAD has been pursued for its potential application to hearing-aid design in which an attention-guided algorithm selects, from multiple competing acoustic sources, which should be enhanced for the listener and which should be suppressed. Traditionally, researchers have separated the AAD problem into two stages: reconstruction of a representation of the attended audio from neural signals, followed by determining the similarity between the candidate audio streams and the reconstruction. Here, we compare the traditional two-stage approach with a novel neural-network architecture that subsumes the explicit similarity step. We compare this new architecture against linear and non-linear (neural-network) baselines using both wet and dry electroencephalogram (EEG) systems. Our results indicate that the new architecture outperforms the baseline linear stimulus-reconstruction method, improving decoding accuracy from 66% to 81% using wet EEG and from 59% to 87% for dry EEG. Also of note was the finding that the dry EEG system can deliver comparable or even better results than the wet, despite the latter having one third as many EEG channels as the former. The 11-subject, wet-electrode AAD dataset for two competing, co-located talkers, the 11-subject, dry-electrode AAD dataset, and our software are available for further validation, experimentation, and modification.

A critical feature for the maintenance of precise skeletal muscle force production by the human brain is its ability to configure motor function activity dynamically and adaptively in response to visual and somatosensory information. Existing studies have concluded that not only the sensorimotor area but also distributed cortical areas act cooperatively in the generation of motor commands for voluntary force production to the desired level. However, less attention has been paid to such physiological mechanisms in conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) design and implementation. We proposed a new, physiologically inspired two-stage decoding method to see its contribution on accuracy improvement of BCI. Approach. We performed whole-head high-density scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recording during a right finger force-matching task at three strength levels (20%, 40%, and 60% maximal voluntary contraction following a resting state). A two-stage regression approach was employed that decodes muscle contraction level from EEG signals in the multi-level force-matching task and translates them into: (1) presence/absence of muscle contraction as a first stage; and (2) muscle contraction level as a second stage. Dimensionality reduction of the EEG signals, using principal component analysis, avoided multicollinearity during multiple regression, and data-driven stepwise multiple regression identified EEG components that were involved in the multi-level force-matching task. Main results. An alternatively tuned two-stage regressor accurately decoded muscle contraction level with online processing rather than the conventional decoders, and identified EEG components that were related to voluntary force production. Relaxation/contraction state-dependent EEG components were localized dominantly in the contralateral parieto-temporal regions, whereas multi-level force regulation-dependent EEG components came from the fronto-parietal regions. Significance. Our findings identify respective cortical signalings during relaxation/contraction and multi-level force regulation using a sensor-based approach with EEG. Simulation-based assessment of the current physiologically inspired decoding technique proved improved accuracy in online BCI control.

Epilepsy is one such problem that affects the brain by causing seizures termed as epileptic seizures. People in rural areas believe epileptic attacks to be results of influence of black magic and resorted to unscientific practices for treatment. Repeated occurrence of seizures could lead to death. The early detection and treatment would cure 70 percent of the cases. The study of the epileptic activity can be done using EEG recordings of the brain. Although many software packages offers complete tool set for complex EEG analysis which is not as candid compared to brain-imaging techniques user need to choose appropriate framework suitable for their application scenario. In this paper we propose four different combination of feature extraction and classification techniques for detecting epileptic seizures and this study aims to compare the results in context of accuracy. The combination of discrete wavelet transform for feature extraction and early learning machine algorithm for classifications generates 90.1% accuracy in classifying epileptic seizures. Also this framework reduces computation time by selection of proper EEG channel data by preprocessing which helps to develop an expert system which emulates the decision making of a human expert.

Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an effective method for time-frequency analysis of EEG and has been used for seizure detection in daily healthcare monitoring systems. However, the shift variance, the lack of directionality and the substantial aliasing, limit the effects of DWT in some applications. Dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DTDWT) can overcome those drawbacks but may increase information redundancy. For classification tasks with small dataset sizes, such redundancy can greatly reduce learning efficiency and model performance. In this work, we proposed a novel redundancy removed DTDWT (RR-DTDWT) framework for automated seizure detection. Energy and modified multi-scale entropy (MMSE) features in a dual tree wavelet domain were extracted to construct a complete picture of mental states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ MMSE as an indicator of epileptic seizures. Moreover, a compact EEG representation can be obtained after removing useless information redundancy (redundancy between wavelet trees, adjacent channels and entropy scales) by a general auto-weighted feature selection framework via global redundancy minimization (AGRM). Through validation on Bonn and CHB-MIT databases, the proposed RR-DTDWT method can achieve better performance than previous studies.

To overcome this strait, maximal overlap discrete wavelet package transform (MODWPT) was introduced to characterize epileptic EEG for the first time and the multi-basis MODWPT-based feature extraction was further proposed in this study. Instead of merely using single wavelet basis, multiple bases were synchronously adopted in one-time implementation of multi-basis MODWPT. Six dimensionality reduction algorithms, namely principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP), locally linear embedding (LLE) and Laplacian eigenmaps (LE), were then employed to map the extracted features into other domain in feature selection procedure. Finally, the mapped features were fed into a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) for classification and multiple kernel learning support vector machine (MKLSVM) was used as comparison. Experimental results show the combination of multi-basis MODWPT, ICA and LS-SVM with linear kernel provides the highest accuracy of 99.67% in classifying inter-ictal and ictal EEGs while MKLSVM in conjunction with multi-basis MODWPT-based PCA also leads to the maximal accuracy of 99.83%. Our presented scheme yields superior performance than the majority of newly-developed methods and is proven useful. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Various machine learning decoders have shown high accuracy performance on classifying the gait state whether the subject is walking or standing. However, there is a trade-off between the accuracy and the responsiveness due to the delay time. The delay time is critical when controlling the exoskeleton robots with EEG decoders online (real-time). In this research, we propose spatio-spectral convolutional neural networks with relatively short segment of EEG data (0.2s) having 83.4% accuracy on gait state recognition. The gait intention recognition that detects the subject's gait intention prior to the actual gait had 77.3% accuracy. We were able to classify EEG data of both healthy subjects and stroke patients at subacute and chronic phases.

A Convolutional Neural Network approach for classification of dementia stages based on 2D-spectral representation of EEG recordings	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Deep learning; Convolutional Neural Network; Power spectral density; Alzheimer's disease; Mild Cognitive Impairment	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DISCRIMINATION; DYNAMICS; POWER	A data-driven machine deep learning approach is proposed for differentiating subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC), by only analyzing noninvasive scalp EEG recordings. The methodology here proposed consists of evaluating the power spectral density (PSD) of the 19-channels EEG traces and representing the related spectral profiles into 2-d gray scale images (PSD-images). A customized Convolutional Neural Network with one processing module of convolution, Rectified Linear Units (ReLu) and pooling layer (CNN1) is designed to extract from PSD-images some suitable features and to perform the corresponding two and three-ways classification tasks. The resulting CNN is shown to provide better classification performance when compared to more conventional learning machines; indeed, it achieves an average accuracy of 89.8% in binary classification and of 83.3% in three-ways classification. These results encourage the use of deep processing systems (here, an engineered first stage, namely the PSD-image extraction, and a second or multiple CNN stage) in challenging clinical frameworks.

Methods To this end, we analyzed 820 seizures from 252 consecutive patients explored by stereo-electroencephalography (total of 2148 electrodes), including various forms of focal refractory epilepsies. We used a reproducible method combining visual and time-frequency analyses. Results We described eight SOPs: low-voltage fast activity (LVFA), preictal spiking followed by LVFA, burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA, slow wave/DC shift followed by LVFA, sharp theta/alpha waves, beta sharp waves, rhythmic spikes/spike-waves, and delta-brush. LVFA occurred in 79% of patients. The seizure onset pattern was significantly associated with (1) underlying etiology (burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA with the presence of a focal cortical dysplasia, LVFA with malformation of cortical development, postvascular and undetermined epilepsies), (2) spatial organization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ; burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA with focal organization, slow wave/DC shift followed by LVFA with network organization), and (3) postsurgical seizure outcome (better outcome when LVFA present). Significance This study demonstrates that the main determinants of the SOP are the underlying etiology and the spatial organization of the EZ. Concerning the postsurgical seizure outcome, the main determinant factor is the spatial organization of the EZ, but the SOP plays also a role, conferring better prognosis when LVFA is present.

This study aims to enhance the EEG features via an visual feedback training process by improving the visual feedback training paradigm design, EEG signal acquisition and EEG signal analysis, etc. We presented a novel feature extraction method in order to systematically improve the effective of feature selection, in which the coupling properties of EEG were combined with multi-level dynamic features including the time, frequency and spatial characteristics of EEG. Four subjects were guided to perform the Motor Imagery(MI) experiment with visual feedback training. Then, the integral value, Autoregressive (AR) model coefficients, avelet energy spectrum, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and mutual information were calculated as indices to quantify the enhancement of EEG characteristics before and after training. Statistical analysis revealed that the classification accuracy of EEG signals after training was significantly improved.

The signals are recorded during the answering of 2D and 3D questions. The system is used to classify the correct and incorrect answers for both 2D and 3D questions. Using the classification, we compared the impact of 3D and 2D educational contents on recall, learning and memory retention. Same 3D and 2D contents are presented to subjects for learning purpose. After learning, twenty multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are asked from the subjects related to the learned contents after two stages: two months (Long-Term Memory (LTM)) and 30 minutes (Short-Term Memory (STM)). Next, discriminative features from color histogram are extracted from topomap images. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier to predict brain states related to incorrect / correct answers. Results show the superiority of the proposed system.

It is also a key component of human-computer interaction systems(HCISs). Naturally, facial emotion recognition(FER) has become a hot topic of current research. At present, the methods of FER typically rely on vision, using computer technology to extract visual features from face images. However, these features are derived from data-driven models, lacking the cognitive minds from the brain, so the recognition performance is not ideal in some cases. Factually, EEG features evoked by facial emotion images have high-level representations of emotion and good discrimination. For this, we propose a novel brain-machine collaborative method for FER. Firstly, EEG emotional features are extracted from the EEG signals collected when people observe emotion images. Secondly, the image visual features are extracted from the original facial emotion images. Thirdly, a regression model is used to find a mapping relationship between these two features in training stage. Finally, the EEG-like features predicted by pre-trained regression model are used in the test set to identify emotions. This method has been verified on CFAPS and found that the average recognition accuracy of the seven emotions is 88.28%, which is better than the simple image-based method.

It is essential to be able to classify mental task information through the use in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This paper proposes a wavelet packet transform (WPT) technique merged with a specific entropy biomarker as a feature extraction tool to classify six mental tasks. First, the data were collected from a healthy control group and the multi-signal information comprised six mental tasks which were decomposed into a number of subspaces spread over a wide frequency spectrum by projecting six different wavelet basis functions. Later, the decomposed subspaces were subjected to three entropy-type statistical measure functions to extract the feature vectors for each mental task to be fed into a backpropagation time-recurrent neural network (BPTT-RNN) model. Cross-validated classification results demonstrated that the model could classify with 85% accuracy through a discrete Meyer basis function coupled with a Renyi entropy biomarker. The classifier model was finally tested in the Simulink platform to demonstrate the Fourier series representation of periodic signals by tracking the harmonic pattern. In order to boost the model performance, ant colony optimization (ACO)-based feature selection method was employed. The overall accuracy increased to 88.98%. The results underlined that the WPT combined with an entropy uncertainty measure methodology is both effective and versatile to discriminate the features of the signal localized in a time-frequency domain.

Nevertheless, the evolution of such interfaces is currently hampered by the unavailability of embedded platforms capable of delivering the required computational power at high energy efficiency and allowing for a small and unobtrusive form factor. To fill this gap, we developed BioWolf, a highly wearable (40mm 20 mm 2 mm) BCI platform based on Mr. Wolf, a parallel ultra low power system-on-chip featuring nine RISC-V cores with DSP-oriented instruction set extensions. BioWolf also integrates a commercial 8-channel medical-grade analog-to-digital converter, and an ARM-Cortex M4 microcontroller unit (MCU) with bluetooth low-energy connectivity. To demonstrate the capabilities of the system, we implemented and tested a BCI featuring canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of steady-state visual evoked potentials. The system achieves an average information transfer rate of 1.46 b/s (aligned with the state-of-the-art of bench-top systems). Thanks to the reduced power envelope of the digital computational platform, which consumes less than the analog front-end, the total power budget is just 6.31mW, providing up to 38h operation (65mAh battery). To our knowledge, our design is the first to explore the significant energy boost of a parallel MCU with respect to single-core MCUs for CCA-based BCI.

EEG signals on epilepsy attacks have a characteristic pattern that allows health professionals to distinguish them from normal conditions (nonseizure). There are many methods used by researchers to recognize patterns of EEG epilepsy and non epilepsy signals in this study using Discrete Cosinus Transform (DCT) to perform the extraction of EEG signal features and Backpropagation Neural Networks for identification of EEG signal patterns. This research data using five classes of data sets of digital EEG signal taken from clinic Epileptologie University of Bonn ie data set A normal open eye signal, set B normal eye closed signal, C set enter the epilepsy zone, set D enter epilepsy, set E epilepsy seizures. The five class data are processed using DCT to obtain feature extraction, so results from DCT are used to perform identification using the Backpropagation method. The results of this study indicate that with feature extracted using DCT and identification process using Artificial Neural Network Backpropagation got EEG signal identification obtained for data set A, B, C, D and E is 76%, for set AB and CDE class data 73 %.

Regression-based reconstruction of human grip force trajectories with noninvasive scalp electroencephalography	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; force; neural decoding; brain machine interface; kinetics; grip; hand	TARGETED MUSCLE REINNERVATION; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; PRIMARY MOTOR; GRASP KINEMATICS; SPIKING ACTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; REAL-TIME; MOVEMENTS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; INFORMATION	Objective. Robotic devices show promise in restoring motor abilities to individuals with upper limb paresis or amputations. However, these systems are still limited in obtaining reliable signals from the human body to effectively control them. We propose that these robotic devices can be controlled through scalp electroencephalography (EEG), a neuroimaging technique that can capture motor commands through brain rhythms. In this work, we studied if EEG can be used to predict an individual?s grip forces produced by the hand. Approach. Brain rhythms and grip forces were recorded from able-bodied human subjects while they performed an isometric force production task and a grasp-and-lift task. Grip force trajectories were reconstructed with a linear model that incorporated delta band (0.1?1 Hz) voltage potentials and spectral power in the theta (4?8 Hz), alpha (8?13 Hz), beta (13?30 Hz), low gamma (30?50 Hz), mid gamma (70?110 Hz), and high gamma (130?200 Hz) bands. Trajectory reconstruction models were trained and tested through 10-fold cross validation. Main results. Modest accuracies were attained in reconstructing grip forces during isometric force production (median r??=??0.42), and the grasp-and-lift task (median r??=??0.51). Predicted trajectories were also analyzed further to assess the linear models? performance based on task requirements. For the isometric force production task, we found that predicted grip trajectories did not yield static grip forces that were distinguishable in magnitude across three task conditions. For the grasp-and-lift task, we estimate there would be an approximate 25% error in distinguishing when a user wants to hold or release an object. Significance. These findings indicate that EEG, a noninvasive neuroimaging modality, has predictive information in neural features associated with finger force control and can potentially contribute to the development of brain machine interfaces (BMI) for performing activities of daily living.

This study investigates which state of vigilance is the best to localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ) in interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Thirty patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing stereo-EEG (SEEG)/sleep recording and subsequent open surgery were included; 13 patients (43.3%) had good surgical outcome (Engel class I). Sleep was scored following standard criteria. Multiple features based on the interictal EEG (interictal epileptiform discharges, high-frequency oscillations, univariate and bivariate features) were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) model to classify SEEG contacts placed in the EZ. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the mean area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) and positive predictive values (PPVs) across 10-minute sections of wake, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) stages N2 and N3, REM sleep, and their combination. Results: Highest AUCs were achieved in NREM sleep stages N2 and N3 compared to wakefulness and REM (P <.01). There was no improvement when using a combination of all four states (P >.05); the best performing features in the combined state were selected from NREM sleep. There were differences between good (Engel I) and poor (Engel II-IV) outcomes in PPV (P <.05) and AUC (P <.01) across all states. The SVM multifeature approach outperformed spikes and high-frequency oscillations (P <.01) and resulted in results similar to those of the seizure-onset zone (SOZ; P >.05). Significance: Sleep improves the localization of the EZ with best identification obtained in NREM sleep stages N2 and N3. Results based on the multifeature classification in 10 minutes of NREM sleep were not different from the results achieved by the SOZ based on 12.7 days of seizure monitoring. This finding might ultimately result in a more time-efficient intracranial presurgical investigation of focal epilepsy.

Supervised learning with Convolutional Neural Networks has become the state of the art approach in many image related works. However, despite the great success of deep learning methods in other areas they remain relatively unexplored in the brain imaging field. In this paper we make an overview of recent achievements of Deep Learning to automatically extract features from brain signals that enable building Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI). Major challenge in the BMI research is to find common subject-independent neural signatures due to the high brain data variability across multiple subjects. To address this problem we propose a Deep Neural Autoencoder with sparsity constraint as a promising approach to extract hidden features from Electroencephalogram data (in-dept feature learning) and build a subject-independent noninvasive BMI in the affective neuro computing framework. Future direction for research are also outlined.

To some extent, signals from some channels containing redundant information and noise may degrade BCI performance. We assume that the channels related to MI should contain common information when participants are executing the MI tasks. Based on this hypothesis, a correlation-based channel selection (CCS) method is proposed to select the channels that contained more correlated information in this study. The aim is to improve the classification performance of MI-based BCIs. Furthermore, a novel regularized common spatial pattern (RCSP) method is used to extract effective features. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is trained to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI competition IV dataset1, BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition III dataset Ma) to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show that the CCS algorithm obtained superior classification accuracy (78% versus 56.4% for dataset1, 86.6% versus 76.5% for dataset 2 and 91.3% versus 85.1% for dataset 3) compared to the algorithm using all channels (AC), when CSP is used to extract the features. Furthermore, RCSP could further improve the classification accuracy (81.6% for datasetl, 87.4% for dataset2 and 91.9% for dataset 3), when CCS is used to select the channels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This feature engineering demands considerable competence in mathematics, digital signal processing, statistics, linear algebra, etc. Researchers generating these time series often have clinical backgrounds, and may not be in a position to design and extract these features by hand. However, they are likely to be familiar with rudimentary - but fundamental - data visualisation methods. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether the application of transfer learning to such a classification problem can facilitate the replacement of involved feature engineering with straightforward data visualisation. While a classification accuracy of over 80% is achieved, the trained neural network exhibits the hallmarks of overfitting. We suggest alternative data visualisation techniques and modifications to the transfer learning method employed that may yield better results for multichannel neural time series data.

Yet, not much is known about the mechanisms and brain regions driving the size of subliminally induced conflicts. We hence combined a response conflict paradigm featuring subliminal primes and conscious flankers with in-depth neurophysiological (EEG) analyses, including source localization in a sample of N = 243 healthy subjects. Intra-individual differences in the size of subliminal conflicts were reflected both during early attentional stimulus processing (prime-associated N1 and target-associated P1 and N1 amplitudes) and conflict monitoring (N2 amplitudes). On the neuroanatomical level, this was reflected by activity modulations in the TPJ (BA39, BA40) and V2 (BA18), which are known to be involved in attentional stimulus processing and task set maintenance. In addition to a "standard" analysis of event-related potentials, we also conducted a purely data-driven machine learning approach using support vector machines (SVM) in order to identify neurophysiological features which do not only reflect the size of subliminal conflict, but actually allow to classify/predict it. This showed that only extremely early information processing (about 65 ms after the onset of the prime) was predictive of subliminal conflict size. Importantly, this predictive feature occurred before target information could even be processed and was reflected by activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (BA6) and insula (BA13). We conclude that differences in task set maintenance and potentially also in subliminal attentional processing of task-relevant features, but not conflict monitoring, determine the size of subliminally induced response conflicts.

We examined the role of stereo-EEG in TSC and used stereo-EEG data to investigate tuber and surrounding cortex epileptogenicity. Methods We analyzed 18 patients with TSC who underwent stereo-EEG (seven adults). One hundred ten seizures were analyzed with the epileptogenicity index (EI). In 13 patients with adequate tuber sampling, five anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) were defined: dominant tuber (tuber with highest median EI), perituber cortex, secondary tuber (tuber with second highest median EI), nearby cortex (normal-appearing cortex in the same lobe as dominant tuber), and distant cortex (in other lobes). At the seizure level, epileptogenicity of ROIs was examined by comparing the highest EI recorded within each anatomical region. At the patient level, epileptogenic zone (EZ) organization was separated into focal tuber (EZ confined to dominant tuber) and complex (all other patterns). Results The most epileptogenic ROI was the dominant tuber, with higher EI than perituber cortex, secondary tuber, nearby cortex, and distant cortex (P < .001). A focal tuber EZ organization was identified in seven patients. This group had 80% Engel IA postsurgical outcome and distinct dominant tuber characteristics: continuous interictal discharges (IEDs; 100%), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hypointense center (86%), center-to-rim EI gradient, and stimulation-induced seizures (71%). In contrast, six patients had a complex EZ organization, characterized by nearby cortex as the most epileptogenic region and 40% Engel IA outcome. At the intratuber level, the combination of FLAIR hypointense center, continuous IEDs, and stimulation-induced seizures offered 98% specificity for a focal tuber EZ organization. Significance Tubers with focal EZ organization have a striking similarity to type II focal cortical dysplasia. The presence of distinct EZ organizations has significant implications for EZ hypothesis generation, invasive EEG approach, and resection strategy.

To identify the target speaker from single-trial EEG recordings in an acoustic scenario with two competing speakers, an auditory attention decoding (AAD) method was recently proposed. Aiming at enhancing the target speaker and suppressing the interfering speaker and ambient noise, in this paper we propose a cognitive-driven speech enhancement system, consisting of a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimator, steerable beamformers and AAD. To preserve the spatial impression of the acoustic scene, which is important when intending to switch attention between speakers, the proposed system only partially suppresses the interfering speaker. The speech enhancement performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) improvement in anechoic and reverberant conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed system can obtain a considerably large SINR improvement (between 3:1 dB and 7:5 dB) in both conditions.

Unfortunately, many machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding deliberately designed perturbations to the original inputs. Many adversarial attack approaches for classification problems have been proposed, but few have considered target adversarial attacks for regression problems. This paper proposes two such approaches. More specifically, we consider white-box target attacks for regression problems, where we know all information about the regression model to be attacked, and want to design small perturbations to change the regression output by a pre-determined amount. Experiments on two BCI regression problems verified that both approaches are effective. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from both approaches are also transferable, which means that we can use adversarial examples generated from one known regression model to attack an unknown regression model, i.e., to perform black-box attacks. To our knowledge, this is the first study on adversarial attacks for EEG-based BCI regression problems, which calls for more attention on the security of BCI systems.

It motivates to build estimator for revealing the human cognitive behaviours for different environments. In this work, we present an operational human cognitive behaviour detection system based on ambulatory EEG signal analysis. A novel event driven environment is created using external stimuli to collect those signals. They are captured using 14 channel Emotiv neuro-headset. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is a very popular feature extraction method in acoustic signal processing. In spite of it's popularity, it has not been explored much when it comes to EEG signals. This paper proposes a novel technique of applying MFCC feature extraction method for ambulatory EEG signals and the results are found to be promising. Besides other feature extraction methods such as: Power Spectral Density (PSD), Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) are used to extract intrinsic features from EEG signal. A statistical technique, Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) is applied on them to evaluate the robustness of each feature. A higher FDR value is observed from MFCC features which demonstrate its discriminative power during classification. Different machine learning techniques such as Probabilistic neural network (P-NN), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), multi-class support vector machine (MCSVM) are applied for training, testing and validating the extracted features. A comparative analysis is discussed for each classifier coupled with each feature. It is found that P-NN with MFCC feature produces the maximum accuracy of 92.61% amongst all the remaining classifiers.

In this study we assessed the predictive power of quantitative EEG (qEEG) for the treatment response to right frontal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) using a machine learning approach. Method. The study included 50 OCD patients (35 responsive to TMS, 15 nonresponsive) who were treated with right frontal low frequency stimulation and identified retrospectively from Uskudar Unversity, NPIstanbul Brain Hospital outpatient clinic. All patients were diagnosed with OCD according to the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria. We first extracted pretreatment band powers for patients. To explore the prediction accuracy of pretreatment EEG, we employed machine learning methods using an artificial neural network model. Results. Among 4 EEG bands, theta power successfully discriminated responsive from nonresponsive patients. Responsive patients had more theta powers for all electrodes as compared to nonresponsive patients. Discussion. qEEG could be helpful before deciding about treatment strategy in OCD. The limitations of our study are moderate sample size and limited number of nonresponsive patients and that treatment response was defined by clinicians and not by using a formal symptom measurement scale. Future studies with larger samples and prospective design would show the role of qEEG in predicting TMS response better.

The present study aimed to investigate the potential factors associated with disease development, electroencephalography (EEG) sub-classification, and outcome measures. Methods The 10-year medical records of patients who underwent EEG between 2007 and 2016 at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan, and developed encephalopathy after cefepime therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Age- and sex-matched controls were included for further analysis. Demographic data, the occurrence of clinical seizures, non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), receiving maintenance or urgent hemodialysis, EEG findings, and functional outcomes were analyzed. The Chi-square test and a logistic regression model were applied to survey significant prognostic factors relating to mortality. Results A total of 42 CIN patients were identified, including 25 patients from wards and 17 from intensive care units; their mean age was 75.8 +/- 11.8 years. Twenty-one patients (50%) had chronic kidney disease, and 18 (43%) had acute kidney injury. Among these patients, 32 (76%) received appropriate cefepime dose adjustment. Three patients had a normal renal function at the time of CIN onset. The logistic regression model suggested that maintenance hemodialysis and longer duration of cefepime use were independently associated with the development of CIN, with odds ratios of 3.8 and 1.2, respectively. NCSE was frequently noted in the CIN patients (64%). Generalized periodic discharge with or without triphasic morphology was the most common EEG pattern (38%), followed by generalized rhythmic delta activity and generalized spike-and-waves. AEDs were administered to 86% of the patients. A total of 17 patients (40%) did not survive to hospital discharge. Adequate cefepime dose adjustment and early cefepime discontinuation led to a better prognosis. Conclusions CIN was associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Neurotoxic symptoms could still occur when the cefepime dose was adjusted, or in patients with normal renal function. Patients with maintenance hemodialysis or a longer duration of cefepime therapy tended to develop CIN. Early recognition of abnormal EEG findings allowed for the withdrawal of the offending agent, resulting in clinical improvements and a better prognosis at discharge.

Deep convolutional neural network for classification of sleep stages from single-channel EEG signals	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Sleep stage analysis; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; Classification	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; FEATURES; SYSTEM	Using a smart method for automatic diagnosis in medical applications, such as sleep stage classification is considered as one of the important challenges of the last few years which can replace the time-consuming process of visual inspection done by specialists. One of the problems regarding the automatic diagnosis of sleep patterns is extraction and selection of discriminative features generally demanding high computational burden. This paper provides a new single-channel approach to automatic classification of sleep stages from EEG signal. The main idea is to directly apply the raw EEG signal to deep convolutional neural network, without involving feature extraction/selection, which is a challenging process in the previous literature. The proposed network architecture includes 9 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. In order to make the samples of different classes balanced, we used a preprocessing method called data augmentation. The simulation results of the proposed method for classification of 2 to 6 classes of sleep stages show the accuracy of 98.10%, 96.86%, 93.11%, 92.95%, 93.55% and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.98%, 0.94%, 0.90%, 0.86% and 0.89%, respectively. Furthermore, comparing the obtained results with the state-of-the-art methods reveals the performance improvement of the proposed sleep stage classification in terms of accuracy and Cohen's Kappa coefficient.

Tensor Decomposition of Non-EEG Physiological Signals for Visualization and Recognition of Human Stress	ICBBT 2019: 2019 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Technology (ICBBT)	MAY 29-31, 2019	Stockholm, SWEDEN			Stress assessment; physiological signals; biosensors; tensor decomposition; feature visualization; pattern classification		Recognition of physical and mental responses to stress is important for the purpose of stress management to reduce its negative effects in health. Wearable technology, mainly using electroencephalogram (EEG), provides information such as tracking fitness activity, disease detection, and neurological states of individuals. However, the recording of EEG signals from a wearable device is inconvenient. This study introduces the application of tensor decomposition of non-EEG data for visualizing and tracking neurological status with implication to human stress recognition. Results obtained from testing the proposed method using a PhyioNet database show visualizations that can well separate four groups of neurological statuses obtained from twenty healthy subjects, and very high up to 100% classification of the neurological statuses. The investigation suggests the potential application of tensor decomposition for the analysis of physiological measurements collected from multiple sensors. The proposed study can significantly contribute to the advancement of wearable technology for human stress monitoring.	[Pham, Thi T.

Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by uncontrolled excessive activity. Repeated abnormal disturbance or seizure causes epilepsy. Hence, EEG signals act as a diagnostic tool for epilepsy. An approach based on tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT) is presented for classification of EEG signals as either seizure or normal activity in the brain. A binarized dataset with sampled signal levels and the corresponding class is subjected to a genetic approach for acquiring an optimized predictive model. In TPOT, the tedious process involved in machine learning being repeatedly performed until arriving at the best solution is automated using genetic algorithm, i.e., evaluate-select-crossover- mutate is repeated to tune the pipeline. In the settings used in this paper, there are 90 pipeline configurations for evaluation for which around 450 models are fitted and evaluated against the training data in one grid search. The best pipeline is the one with the highest cross-validation score in the run at 95.94%. The test accuracy is at 95.27% which is just a little lower than the cross-validation score. The predictive model consists of pre-processing steps Maximum Absolute Scaler and Function Transformer which is utilized by a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. The system is trained and tested for epileptic seizure detection using raw EEG signals. The optimized features and predictor obtained via TPOT resulted to a high-performance accuracy for epileptic seizure detection.

Accurate sleep stage scoring is an important prerequisite for diagnosing sleep health problems. The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform shows diverse variations under the physical conditions of subjects. To help neurologists better analyze sleep data in a fairly short time, we decide to develop a novel method to extract features from EEG signals. Traditional sleep stage scoring methods typically extract the one-dimensional (1D) features of single-channel EEG signals. This paper is the very first time to represent the single-channel EEG signals as two-dimensional (2D) frequency domain representation. Comparing with similar currently existing methods, a deep learning model trained by frequency domain representation can extract frequency morphological features over EEG signal patterns. We conduct experiments on the real EEG signals dataset, which is obtained from PhysioBank Community. The experiment results show that our method significantly improved the performance of the classifier.

In this paper, we propose a new framework by introducing a tensor-based feature representation of the data and also utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for performing classification of MI-EEG signal. The tensor-based representation that includes the structural information in multi-channel time-varying EEG spectrum is generated from tensor discriminant analysis (TDA), and CNN is designed and optimized accordingly for this representation. Compared with CSP+SVM (the conventional framework which is the most successful in MI-based BCI) in the applications to the BCI competition III-IVa dataset, the proposed framework has the following advantages: (1) the most discriminant patterns can be obtained by applying optimum selection of spatial-spectral-temporal subspace for each subject; (2) the corresponding CNN can take full advantage of tensor-based representation and identify discriminative characteristics robustly. The results demonstrate that our framework can further improve classification performance and has great potential for the practical application of BCI.

Accordingly, whereas much is known about their cortical locus much less is known about the temporal dynamics of visuomotor transformations. Here, we show that multivariate EEG analysis allows for detailed insights into the time course of visual and visuomotor computations of precision grasps. Male and female human participants first previewed one of several objects and, upon its reappearance, reached to grasp it with the thumb and index finger along one of its two symmetry axes. Object shape classifiers reached transient accuracies of 70% at similar to 105 ms, especially based on scalp sites over visual cortex, dropping to lower levels thereafter. Grasp orientation classifiers relied on a system of occipital-to-frontal electrodes. Their accuracy rose concurrently with shape classification but ramped up more gradually, and the slope of the classification curve predicted individual reaction times. Further, cross-temporal generalization revealed that dynamic shape representation involved early and late neural generators that reactivated one another. In contrast, grasp computations involved a chain of generators attaining a sustained state about 100 ms before movement onset. Our results reveal the progression of visual and visuomotor representations over the course of planning and executing grasp movements.

The source localisation was computed for each participant. The activity of brodmann areas (BAs) involved in the brain cortical activity of each participant was measured. Then the mean electric charge flowing through particular areas was calculated. The five different machine learning tools (logistic regression, boosted decision tree, Bayes point machine, classic neural network and averaged perceptron classifier) from the Azure ecosystem were trained, and their accuracy was tested in the task of distinguishing standard and target responses in the experiment. The efficiency of each tool was compared, and it was found out that the best tool was logistic regression and the boosted decision tree in our task. Such an approach can be useful in eliminating somatosensory responses in experimental psychology or even in establishing new communication protocols with mildly mentally disabled subjects.

The success of these approaches has been primarily based on the ability to detect cortical tracking of the acoustic envelope at the scalp level. However, most studies have ignored the effects of visual input, which is almost always present in naturalistic scenarios. In this study, we investigated the effects of visual input on envelope-based cocktail party decoding in two multisensory cocktail party situations: (a) Congruent AV-facing the attended speaker while ignoring another speaker represented by the audio-only stream and (b) Incongruent AV (eavesdropping)-attending the audio-only speaker while looking at the unattended speaker. We trained and tested decoders for each condition separately and found that we can successfully decode attention to congruent audiovisual speech and can also decode attention when listeners were eavesdropping, i.e., looking at the face of the unattended talker. In addition to this, we found alpha power to be a reliable measure of attention to the visual speech. Using parieto-occipital alpha power, we found that we can distinguish whether subjects are attending or ignoring the speaker's face. Considering the practical applications of these methods, we demonstrate that with only six near-ear electrodes we can successfully determine the attended speech. This work extends the current framework for decoding attention to speech to more naturalistic scenarios, and in doing so provides additional neural measures which may be incorporated to improve decoding accuracy.

The purpose of this research is to develop a predictive system to preemptively diagnose Schizophrenia Disease using computational intelligence-based techniques. The system will show the possibilities of getting the disease at an early stage, which will improve the health state of the patients. This will be done using machine learning techniques. The used dataset has 86 records, which was obtained from the Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP) 2014 Schizophrenia Classification Kaggle Challenge. The used techniques in this paper are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Naive Bayesian (NB). The highest accuracy was 90.6977% reached by using SVM, RF, and NB techniques while ANN technique reached 88.3721% accuracy. The obtained accuracies are reached by using 204 features.

In this study, a new CAD system based on EEG signals was developed. The motivation for the development of the CAD system was to diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) disease during covert visual attention tasks. It is worth noting that research of this kind on the efficacy of attention tasks is limited in scope for MS patients; therefore, it is vital to develop a feature of EEG to characterize the patient's state with high sensitivity and specificity. Methods: We evaluated the use of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of EEG signals to diagnose MS. It is assumed that the role of PAC for information encoding during visual attention in MS is greatly unknown; therefore, we made an attempt to investigate it via CAD systems. The EEG signals were recorded from healthy and MS patients while performing new visual attention tasks. Machine learning algorithms were also used to identify the EEG signals as to whether the disease existed or not. The challenge regarding the dimensionality of the extracted features was addressed through selecting the relevant and efficient features using T-test and Bhattacharyya distance criteria, and the validity of the system was assessed through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method. Results: Our findings indicated that online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) classifier with T-test feature selection method yielded peak accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in both color and direction tasks. These values were 91%, 83% and 96% for color task, and 90%, 82% and 96% for the direction task.

To better understand this relationship, different situations could be simulated during which the users' emotional reactions are analyzed through sensors like eye tracking and EEG. In addition, virtual reality environments provide an immersive simulation context that induces high intensity emotions such as excitement. Extracting excitement from EEG provides more precise measures then other methods, however it is not always possible to use EEG headset in virtual reality environment. In this paper we present an alternative approach to the use of EEG for excitement detection using only eye movements. Results showed that there is a correlation between eye movements and excitement index extracted from EEG. Five machine learning algorithms were used in order to predict excitement trend exclusively from eye tracking. Results revealed that we can detect the offline excitements trend directly from eye movements with a precision of 92% using deep neural network.

The calibration burden during data acquisition phase will most probably cause a subject to be reluctant to use a BCI system. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel sparse group representation model (SGRM) for improving the efficiency of MI-based BCI by exploiting the intersubject information. Specifically, preceded by feature extraction using common spatial pattern, a composite dictionary matrix is constructed with training samples from both the target subject and other subjects. By explicitly exploiting within-group sparse and group-wise sparse constraints, the most compact representation of a test sample of the target subject is then estimated as a linear combination of columns in the dictionary matrix. Classification is implemented by calculating the classspecific representation residual based on the significant training samples corresponding to the nonzero representation coefficients. Accordingly, the proposed SGRM method effectively reduces the required training samples from the target subject due to auxiliary data available from other subjects. With two public EEG data sets, extensive experimental comparisons are carried out between SGRM and other stateof-the-art approaches. Superior classification performance of our method using 40 trials of the target subject for model calibration (Averaged accuracy = 78.2%, Kappa = 0.57 and Averaged accuracy = 77.7%, Kappa = 0.55 for the two data sets, respectively) indicates its promising potential for improving the practicality of MI-based BCI.

Muthanantha			Epileptic seizure detection using fuzzy-rules-based sub-band specific features and layered multi-class SVM	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG classification; Feature selection; Fuzzy rules; Wavelet transformation; Seizure detection; Support vector machine	EEG; MACHINE; CLASSIFICATION; FREQUENCY	In this paper, a new epileptic seizure detection method using fuzzy-rules-based sub-band specific features and layered directed acyclic graph support vector machine (LDAG-SVM) is proposed for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Wavelet transformation is used to decompose the input EEG signals into various sub-bands. The nonlinear features, namely approximate entropy, largest Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension, are extracted from each sub-band. In this proposed work, sub-band specific feature subset that is reduced in size and capable of discriminating samples is selected by employing fuzzy rules. For classification purpose, a new LDAG-SVM is used for detecting epileptic seizure. Every sub-band has its own characteristics. If appropriate features which characterize the specific sub-band are selected, then the classification accuracy is improved and computational complexity is reduced. The important advantage of the fuzzy logic is its close relation to human thinking. Due to the lengthy record and intra-professional variability, automation of epileptic detection is inevitable. Fuzzy rules are the natural choice of employing human expertise to build machine learning system. Performances of the proposed methods are evaluated using two different benchmark EEG datasets, namely Bonn and CHB-MIT. The performance measures such as classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, execution time and receiver operating characteristics are used to measure and analyze the performances of the proposed classifier. The proposed LDAG-SVM with fuzzy-rules-based selected sub-band specific features provides better performance in terms of improved classification accuracy with reduced execution time compared to existing methods.

Schizophrenia is an anomaly in the brain characterized by behavioral symptoms such as hallucinations and disorganized speech. Electroencephalograms (EEG) indicate brain disorders and are prominently used to study brain diseases. We collected EEG signals from 14 healthy subjects and 14 SZ patients and developed an eleven-layered convolutional neural network (CNN) model to analyze the signals. Conventional machine learning techniques are often laborious and subject to intra-observer variability. Deep learning algorithms that have the ability to automatically extract significant features and classify them are thus employed in this study. Features are extracted automatically at the convolution stage, with the most significant features extracted at the max-pooling stage, and the fully connected layer is utilized to classify the signals. The proposed model generated classification accuracies of 98.07% and 81.26% for non-subject based testing and subject based testing, respectively. The developed model can likely aid clinicians as a diagnostic tool to detect early stages of SZ.	[Oh, Shu Lih; Vicnesh, Jahmunah; Acharya, U.

Shamim			Multilevel Weighted Feature Fusion Using Convolutional Neural Networks for EEG Motor Imagery Classification	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						EEG motor imagery classification; deep learning; convolution neural network; multilevel feature fusion		Deep learning methods, such as convolution neural networks (CNNs), have achieved remarkable success in computer vision tasks. Hence, an increasing trend in using deep learning for electroencephalograph (EEG) analysis is evident. Extracting relevant information from CNN features is one of the key reasons behind the success of the CNN-based deep learning models. Some CNN models use convolutional features from different CNN layers with good effect. However, extraction and fusion of multilevel convolutional features remain unexplored for EEG applications. Moreover, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence experience increasing applications in all fields. Cognitive process is based on understanding human brain cognition through signals, such as EEG. Hence, deep learning can aid in developing cognitive systems and related applications by improving EEG decoding. The classification and recognition of EEG have consistently been challenging due to its characteristics of dynamic time series data and low signal-to-noise ratio. However, the information hidden in different convolution layers can aid in improving feature discrimination capability. In this paper, we use the EEG motor imagery data to uncover the benefits of extracting and fusing multilevel convolutional features from different CNN layers, which are abstract representations of the input at various levels. Our proposed CNN model can learn robust spectral and temporal features from the raw EEG data. We demonstrate that such multilevel feature fusion outperforms the models that use features only from the last layer. Our results are better than the state of the art for EEG decoding and classification.

Unfortunately, the rate of misdiagnosis between VS and MCS due to clinical judgment is high. Therefore, diagnostic decision support systems aiming to correct any differentiation between VS and MCS are essential for the characterization of an adequate treatment and an effective prognosis. In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in the new EEG computational techniques. We have reviewed how resting-state EEG is computationally analyzed to support differential diagnosis between VS and MCS in view of applicability of these methods in clinical practice. The studies available so far have used different techniques and analyses; it is therefore hard to draw general conclusions. Studies using a discriminant analysis with a combination of various factors and reporting a cut-off are among the most interesting ones for a future clinical application.

The brain activity of patients suffering from epilepsy is monitored through electroencephalography (EEG). The multivariate nature of features from time domain, frequency domain, complexity and wavelet entropy based, and the statistical features were extracted from healthy and epileptic subjects using the Bonn University database and seizure and non-seizure intervals using the CHB MIT database. The robust machine learning regression methods based on regression, support vector regression (SVR), regression tree (RT), ensemble regression, Gaussian process regression (GPR) were employed for detecting and predicting epileptic seizures. Performance was measured in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), squared error, mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Moreover, detailed optimization was performed using a RT to predict the selected features from each feature category. A deeper analysis was conducted on features and tree regression methods where optimal RMSE and MSE results were obtained. The best optimal performance was obtained using the ensemble boosted regression tree (BRT) and exponential GPR with an RMSE of 0.47, an MSE (0.22), an R Square (RS) (0.25) and an MAE (0.30) using the Bonn University database and support vector machine (SVM) fine Gaussian with RMSE (0.63634), RS (0.03), MSE (040493) and MAE (0.31744); squared exponential GPR and rational quadratic GPR with an RMSE of 0.63841, an RS (0.03), an MSE (0.40757) and an MAE (0.3472) was obtained using the CHB MIT database.

Previously, we introduced a novel hybrid BCI in which EEG and fTCD modalities are used simultaneously to measure electrical brain activity and cerebral blood velocity during motor imagery (MI) tasks. New method: In this paper, we used multi-scale analysis and common spatial pattern algorithm to extract EEG and fTCD features. Moreover, we proposed probabilistic fusion of EEG and fTCD evidences instead of concatenating EEG and fTCD feature vectors corresponding to each trial. A Bayesian approach was proposed to fuse EEG and fTCD evidences under 3 different assumptions. Results: Experimental results showed that 93.85%, 93.71%, and 100% average accuracies and 19.89, 26.55, and 40.83 bits/min average ITRs were achieved for right MI vs baseline, left MI versus baseline, and right MI versus left MI respectively. Comparison with existing methods: These performance measures outperformed the results we obtained before in our preliminary study in which average accuracies of 88.33%, 89.48%, and 82.38% and average ITRs of 4.17, 5.45, and 10.57 bits/min were achieved for right MI versus baseline, left MI versus baseline, and right MI versus left MI respectively. Moreover, in terms of both accuracy and speed, the EEG- fTCD BCI with the proposed analysis techniques outperformed all EEG- fNIRS studies in comparison. Conclusions: The proposed system is a more accurate and faster alternative to EEG-fNIRS systems.

It is also often used to investigate the functional variation of random signals. In this work, we propose a novel approach by analyzing EEG signals in the spectral domain using functional data analysis techniques including functional descriptive statistics, functional probes, and functional principal component analysis. By first transforming EEG signals into their power spectra, the functionality of random signals is greatly enhanced. Because of this improvement, the application of functional data analysis becomes meaningful in feature extraction of random signals. Our study also illustrates a great potential of using functional PCA as a feature extractor for EEG signals in epilepsy diagnosis.

The "MS-ROM/IFAST" Model, a Novel Parallel Nonlinear EEG Analysis Technique, Distinguishes ASD Subjects From Children Affected With Other Neuropsychiatric Disorders With High Degree of Accuracy	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						children; electroencephalogram (EEG); artificial neural network; machine learning systems; autism spectrum disorder; differential diagnosis	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IFAST MODEL; AUTISM; INTERVENTION; CONNECTIVITY; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSIS; NETWORKS	Background and Objective. In a previous study, we showed a new EEG processing methodology called Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map/Implicit Function As Squashing Time (MS-ROM/IFAST) performing an almost perfect distinction between computerized EEG of Italian children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing children. In this study, we assessed this system in distinguishing ASD subjects from children affected with other neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). Methods. At a psychiatric practice in Texas, 20 children diagnosed with ASD and 20 children diagnosed with NPD were entered into the study. Continuous segments of artifact-free EEG data lasting 10 minutes were entered in MS-ROM/IFAST. From the new variables created by MS-ROM/IFAST, only 12 has been selected according to a correlation criterion. The selected features represent the input on which supervised machine learning systems (MLS) acted as blind classifiers. Results. The overall predictive capability in distinguishing ASD from other NPD cases ranged from 93% to 97.5%. The results were confirmed in further experiments in which Italian and US data have been combined. In this analysis, the best MLS reached 95.0% global accuracy in 1 out of 3 classes distinction (ASD, NPD, controls). This study demonstrates the value of EEG processing with advanced MLS in the differential diagnosis between ASD and NPD cases. The results were not affected by age, ethnicity and technicalities of EEG acquisition, confirming the existence of a specific EEG signature in ASD cases. To further support these findings, it was decided to test the behavior of already trained neural networks on 10 Italian very young ASD children (25-37 months). In this test, 9 out of 10 cases have been correctly recognized as ASD subjects in the best case. Conclusions. These results confirm the possibility of an early automatic autism detection based on standard EEG.

This is due to the complex nature of the signal itself and of the generated abnormalities. In this paper, we investigate several deep network architectures i.e. stacked autoencoders and convolutional networks, for unsupervised EEG feature extraction. The proposed EEG features are used to solve the prediction of epileptic seizures via Support Vector Machines. This approach has many benefits: (i) it allows to achieve a high accuracy using small size sample data, e.g. 1 second EEG data; (ii) features are determined in an unsupervised manner, without the need for manual selection. Experimental validation is carried out on real-world data, i.e. the CHB-MIT dataset. We achieve an overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of up to 92%, 95% and 90% respectively.

The segregation of different acoustic streams and the formation of corresponding neural representations is mostly attributed to the auditory cortex. Decoding of selective attention from neuroimaging has therefore focussed on cortical responses to sound. However, the auditory brainstem response to speech is modulated by selective attention as well, as recently shown through measuring the brainstem's response to running speech. Although the response of the auditory brainstem has a smaller magnitude than that of the auditory cortex, it occurs at much higher frequencies and therefore has a higher information rate. Here we develop statistical models for extracting the brainstem response from multichannel scalp recordings and for analysing the attentional modulation according to the focus of attention. We demonstrate that the attentional modulation of the brainstem response to speech can be employed to decode the attentional focus of a listener from short measurements of 10s or less in duration. The decoding remains accurate when obtained from three EEG channels only. We further show how out-of-the-box decoding that employs subject-independent models, as well as decoding that is independent of the specific attended speaker is capable of achieving similar accuracy. These results open up new avenues for investigating the neural mechanisms for selective attention in the brainstem and for developing efficient auditory brain-computer interfaces.

A review	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Review						Treatment resistant depression; Major depressive disorder; Machine Learning; Depression; Imaging; EEG	RESPONDERS; CACNA1C; STRESS; GENE; RTMS	Background: About one third of patients treated with antidepressant do not show sufficient symptoms relief and up to 15% of patients remain symptomatic even after multiple trials are applied, configuring a state called treatment resistant depression (TRD). A clear definition of this state and the understanding of underlying mechanisms contributing to chronic disability caused by major depressive disorder is still unknown. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) techniques emerged in the last years as interesting approaches to deal with such complex problems. Methods: We performed a bibliographic search on Pubmed, Google Scholar and Medline of clinical, imaging, genetic and EEG ML classification studies on treatment-responding depression and TRD as well as studies trying to predict response to a specific treatment in already established TRD. The inclusion criteria were ma by eleven studies. Seven focused on the definition of predictors of TRD onset while four attempted to predict the response to specific treatments in TRD. Results: The results showed that it seems possible to classify between responders MDD and TRD with good accuracies based on clinical variables. Moreover, some studies reported the possibility of using EEG measures to predict response to different pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in established TRD. Limitations: The definition of TRD, the selection of variables together with ML algorithms and pipelines varies across the studies, ultimately determining the unfeasibility to implement these models in clinical practice. Conclusions: The findings suggest that ML could be a valid approach to increase our understanding of TRD and to better classify and stratify this disorder, which may ultimately help clinicians in the assessment of major depressive disorders.

This study offered an alternative to overcome all the limitations provided by the conventional system to detect sleepiness based on the driver's brain electrical activity using wearable electroencephalogram (EEG), which is lighter and easy to use. The EEG signals were collected using EMOTIV Epoc + and then were decomposed into narrowband frequency, such as delta, theta, alpha, and beta using DWT. The relative power, as the result of feature extraction, then were processed further by calculating its variance using the common spatial pattern (CSP) method to optimize the accuracy of extreme learning machine (ELM). Comparison of relative power between awake and drowsy state showed that during the drowsy state, theta-wave, alpha-wave, and beta-wave were tend to be higher than in the awake state. However, despite with the help of ELM, the accuracy was not too high (below 87%). The feature extraction which continued by calculating its variance using CSP algorithm before classified by ELM obtained a high accuracy, even with small amount of data training. This showed that CSP combining with ELM could be useful to shorten the time in training/calibration session, yet still, obtained high accuracy in classifying the awake state and drowsy state. The overall average accuracy of testing ranged from 91.67% to 93.75%. This study could increase the ability of EEG in detecting drowsiness that is important to prevent the risk caused by driving in a drowsy state.

J	Yilmaz, BH; Yilmaz, CM; Kose, C				Yilmaz, Bahar Hatipoglu; Yilmaz, Cagatay Murat; Kose, Cemal			Diversity in a signal-to-image transformation approach for EEG-based motor imagery task classification	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Angle-amplitude transformation; Angle-amplitude graph images; EEG; Motor imagery; Classification	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; ALGORITHMS	Nowadays, motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed rapidly. In these systems, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are recorded when a subject is involved in the imagination of doing any motor imagery movement like the imagination of the right/left hands, etc. In this paper, we sought to validate and enhance our previously proposed angle-amplitude transformation (AAT) technique, which is a simple signal-to-image transformation approach for the classification of EEG and MEG signals. For this purpose, we diversified our previous method and proposed four new angle-amplitude graph (AAG) representation methods for AAT transformation. These modifications were made on some points such as using different left/right side changing points at a different distance. To confirm the validity of the proposed methods, we performed experiments on the BCI Competition III Dataset IIIa, which is a benchmark dataset widely used for EEG-based multi-class motor imagery tasks. The procedure of proposed methods can be summarized in a concise manner as follows: (i) convert EEG signals to AAG images by using the proposed AAT transformation approaches; (ii) extract image features by employing Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)-based Bag of Visual Word (BoW); and (iii) classify features with k-Nearest Neighbor (k NN) algorithm. Experimental results showed that the changes in the baseline AAT approaches enhanced the classification performance on Dataset IIIa with an accuracy of 96.50% for two-class problem (left/right hand movement imaginations) and 97.99% for four-class problem (left/right hand, foot and tongue movement imaginations). These achievements are mainly due to the help of effective enhancements on AAG image representations. Graphical The flow diagram of the proposed methodology.

To achieve this goal we proposed a method based on machine learning to classify responders (R) and nonresponders (NR) to rTMS treatment for major depression disorder (MDD) patients. Methods: 19 electrodes resting state EEG was recorded from 46 MDD patients before treatment. Then patients underwent 7 weeks of rTMS, and 23 of them responded to treatment. Features extracted from EEG include Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), Katz fractal dimension (KFD), correlation dimension (CD), the power spectral density, features based on bispectrum, frontal and prefrontal cordance and combination of them. The most relevant features were selected by the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm. For classifying two groups of R and NR, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were applied. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by leave-1-out cross-validation. For further study, the capability of features in differentiating R and NR was investigated by a statistical test. Results: Effective EEG features for prediction of rTMS treatment response were found. EEG beta power, the sum of bispectrum diagonal elements in delta and beta bands and CD were the most discriminative features. Power of beta classified R and NR with the high performance of 91.3% accuracy, 91.3% specificity, and 91.3% sensitivity. Limitations: Lack of large sample size restricted our method for using in clinical applications. Conclusion: This considerable high accuracy indicates that our proposed method with power and some of the nonlinear and bispectral features can lead to promising results in predicting treatment outcome of rTMS for MDD patients only by one session pretreatment EEG recording.

This retrospective study now investigated whether BIS EEG tracings can predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest (CA).MethodsBilateral BIS monitoring (BIS VISTA, Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. Norwood, USA) was started following intensive care unit admission. Six, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48h after targeted temperature management (TTM) at 33 degrees C was started, BIS EEG tracings were extracted and reviewed by two neurophysiologists for the presence of slow diffuse rhythm, burst suppression, cerebral inactivity and epileptic activity (defined as continuous, monomorphic, >2Hz generalized sharp activity or continuous, monomorphic, <2Hz generalized blunt activity). At 180days post-CA, neurological outcome was determined using cerebral performance category (CPC) classification (CPC1-2: good and CPC3-5: poor neurological outcome).ResultsSixty-three out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients were enrolled for data analysis of whom 32 had a good and 31 a poor neurological outcome. Epileptic activity within 6-12h predicted CPC3-5 with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%. Epileptic activity within time frames 18-24 and 36-48h showed a PPV for CPC3-5 of 90 and 93%, respectively. Cerebral inactivity within 6-12h predicted CPC3-5 with a PPV of 57%. In contrast, cerebral inactivity between 36 and 48h predicted CPC3-5 with a PPV of 100%. The pattern with the worst predictive power at any time point was burst suppression with PPV of 44, 57 and 40% at 6-12h, at 18-24h and at 36-48h, respectively. Slow diffuse rhythms at 6-12h, at 18-24h and at 36-48h predicted CPC1-2 with PPV of 74, 76 and 80%, respectively.ConclusionBased on simplified BIS EEG, the presence of epileptic activity at any time and cerebral inactivity after the end of TTM may assist poor outcome prognostication in successfully resuscitated CA patients. A slow diffuse rhythm at any time after CA was indicative for a good neurological outcome.

Objective: This paper proposes a patient-specific approach for short-term prediction (i.e., within few minutes) of epileptic seizures. Methods: We use noninvasive EEG data, since the aim is exploring the possibility of developing a noninvasive monitoring/control device for the prediction of seizures. Our approach is based on finding synchronization patterns in the EEG that allow to distinguish in real time preictal from in-terictal states. In practice, we develop easily computable functions over a graph model to capture the variations in the synchronization, and employ a classifier for identifying the preictal state. Results: We compare two state-of-the-art classification algorithms and a simple and computationally inexpensive threshold-based classifier developed ad hoc. Results on publicly available scalp EEG database and on scalp data of the patients of the Unit of Neurology and Neurophysiology at University of Siena show that this simple and computationally viable processing is able to highlight the changes in synchronization when a seizure is approaching. Conclusion and significance: The proposed approach, characterized by low computational requirements and by the use of noninvasive techniques, is a step toward the development of portable and wearable devices for real-life use.

Neuroalgorithms are models of multidimensional brain networks by means of which ADHD patient data can be separated from healthy control data. Methods: Spontaneous electroencephalographic and event-related potential (ERP) data were collected three times over the course of 2 years from a multicentre sample of adults comprising 181 patients with ADHD and 147 healthy controls. Spectral power and ERP amplitude and latency measures were used as input data for a semi-automatic machine-learning framework. Results: ADHD patients and healthy controls could be classified with a sensitivity ranging from 75% to 83% and specificity values of 71% to 77%. In the analysis of the repeated measurements, sensitivity values of the selected logistic regression model remained high (72% and 76%), while specificity values slightly decreased over time (64% and 67%). Conclusions: Implementation of the system in clinical practice requires facilities to track affected networks, as well as expertise in neuropathophysiology. Therefore, the use of neuroalgorithms can enhance the diagnostic process by making it less subjective and more reliable and linking it to the underlying pathology.

However, data insufficiency and high intra- and inter-subject variabilities hinder from taking their advantage of discovering complex patterns inherent in data, which can be potentially useful to enhance EEG classification accuracy. In this paper, we devise a novel framework of training a deep network by adapting samples of other subjects as a means of domain adaptation. Assuming that there are EEG trials of motor-imagery tasks from multiple subjects available, we first select a subject whose EEG signal characteristics are similar to the target subject based on their power spectral density in resting-state EEG signals. We then use EEG signals of both the selected subject (called a source subject) and the target subject jointly in training a deep network. Rather than training a single path network, we adopt a multi-path network architecture, where the shared bottom layers are used to discover common features for both source and target subjects, while the upper layers branch out into (1) source-target subject identification, (2) label prediction optimized for a source subject, and (3) label prediction optimized for a target subject. Based on our experimental results over the BCI Competition IV-IIa dataset, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in various aspects.

This paper aims to explore the emotion associated functional brain connectivity patterns among different subjects. We proposed a critical subnetwork selection approach and extracted three topological features (strength, clustering coefficient, and eigen-vector centrality) based on the constructed brain connectivity networks. The experimental results of 5-fold cross validation on a public emotion EEG dataset called SEED indicate that the common connectivity patterns associated with different emotions do exist, where the coherence connectivity is significantly higher at frontal site in the alpha, beta and gamma bands for the happy emotion, at parietal and occipital sites in the delta band for the sad emotion, and at frontal site in the delta band for the neutral emotion. In addition, the results demonstrate that the topological features considerably outperform the conventional power spectral density feature, and the decision-level fusion strategy achieves the best classification accuracy of 87.04% and the corresponding improvement of 3.78% in comparison with the state-of-the-art using the differential entropy feature on the same dataset.

However, the neural mechanisms through which DBS produces therapeutic benefits, and in some cases unwanted side effects, in these disorders are only partially understood. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques that can assess the neural effects of active stimulation are important for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of DBS therapy. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a safe, passive imaging modality with relatively high spatiotemporal resolution, which makes it a potentially powerful method for examining the cortical network effects of DBS. However, the degree to which magnetic artifacts produced by stimulation and the associated hardware can be suppressed from MEG data, and the comparability between signals measured during DBS-on and DBS-off conditions, have not been fully quantified. The present study used machine learning methods in conjunction with a visual perception task, which should be relatively unaffected by DBS, to quantify how well neural data can be salvaged from artifact contamination introduced by DBS and how comparable DBS-on and DBS-off data are after artifact removal. Machine learning also allowed us to determine whether the spatiotemporal pattern of neural activity recorded during stimulation are comparable to those recorded when stimulation is off. The spatiotemporal patterns of visually evoked neural fields could be accurately classified in all 8 patients with DBS implants during both DBS-on and DBS-off conditions and performed comparably across those two conditions. Further, the classification accuracy for classifiers trained on the spatiotemporal patterns evoked during DBS-on trials and applied to DBS-off trials, and vice versa, were similar to that of the classifiers trained and tested on either trial type, demonstrating the comparability of these patterns across conditions. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of MEG preprocessing techniques, like temporal signal space separation, to salvage neural data from recordings contaminated with DBS artifacts and validate MEG as a powerful tool to study the cortical consequences of DBS.

In this paper, a Cross-Wavelet Transform (XWT) based feature extraction algorithm coupled with a few learning based classification techniques, like the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), the Least-Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) and the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) is proposed to classify the EEG signals and compare the accuracy of the identification of epileptic activities. Benchmark EEG signals from the Bonn University are utilised to classify the EEG signals into the binary classes viz. Normal and Epileptic subjects. Also, a ternary classification model with categories being signals from healthy volunteers with their eyes open and eyes closed, signals from epileptic subjects during the seizure-free interval measured from within and outside the seizure generating zone of the brain and signals from epileptic subjects experiencing seizures has been put forward. The performance of the above-mentioned three supervised classification algorithms is compared by using the same training and testing datasets during stimulation. The accuracy of classification is obtained to be approximately 99%, 97.5%, 98.5% and 98.2%, 96.4%, 94% for binary and multiclass classification, respectively, using the PNN, LS-SVM and LVQ based classifier.

How to extract efficient features from low signal to noise ratio (SNR) EEG signals is one of the challenges in EEG signal analysis. In EEG-based BCI systems, power spectral density (PSD) is an efficient and widely used frequency feature, but the performance may degrade seriously when applied to data with low SNR. To improve the performance of EEG feature extraction, in this paper, we attempt to use the correntropy spectral density (CSD) as an EEG feature, and further combine the CSD and PSD together to construct a combinatorial EEG feature, called CSD&PSD. Firstly, an experiment on artificial EEG data is performed to validate that the CSD is more suitable for non-Gaussian and low SNR signal analysis. Then, the PSD, CSD and CSD&PSD are used to extract features of real motor imagery (MI) EEG signals. The results show that CSD&PSD often outperforms both PSD and CSD in different noise scenarios, which validate that the weighted combination feature CSD&PSD inherits the characteristics of CSD and PSD, and it is more suitable for EEG signal analysis in various SNRs.

A BCI is expected to classify day-to-day life activities like grabbing and lifting a glass of water. Currently, motor imagery based BCI for two closely separated muscle groups like grabbing and lifting an object has not been studied. Challenge of classifying motor imagery of these activities accurately could be solved by using individual BCI. We proposed to achieve the same by using a neural network (machine learning) classifier on high resolution (129 channel) EEG data evaluated continuously every 80ms after spatial filtering using spherical Laplacian. This study employed a motor imagery based BCI optimized for individual subjects (n=28) using EEG data of actual movement for classifying motor imagery of grab, lift and grab+lift of right forearm. A three layered neural network with two output nodes was created for classifying the motor imagery using power of 8-14 Hz band of 500 ms EEG data. This BCI was able to classify motor imagery with 95.65% accuracy. In continuous evaluation, BCI showed a True Positive Rate of 24.89% and False Positive Rate of 12.93%. The percentage of correctly classified motor imagery in each trial was 84.99%, 72.23%, 17.07% for grab, lift and combined respectively. In conclusion, the current BCI was able to classify the motor imagery of grab, lift and grab+lift successfully based on EEG of movement data without any prior training of motor imagery based on last 500ms of data.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a tool that can be used to measure the electrical changes of the brain by using electrodes placed on the scalp. An ictal pattern in the EEG signal can be used to identify seizure condition. Neurologist search for the ictal state by determining slow, spike, and sharp wave in the EEG recording manually. However, the manual method is very vulnerable to human errors. That is why many research has been conducted to develop an automatic seizure detection system. Since the EEG signal is a nonlinear, nonstationary, and chaotic, it is considered as a complex signal. This paper discusses a brief study on signal complexity measurement in the EEG signal in the term of epileptic seizure detection. Complexity measurement based on statistic, entropy, and chaos analysis is explored in six processing domain.

EEG is a physiological signal that recorded from brain activity in the form of brain waves through the scalp. In this study, emotional states will be identified based on EEG signals using the Adaptive Multilayer Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (AMGLVQ) algorithm. The dataset used is DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological and Audiovisual Signals. Emotional conditions that are classified are valence, that is low and high valence. DEAP dataset has imbalanced data characteristics, and one of the advantages of AMGLVQ algorithm is handling classification in imbalanced data conditions. The test results show that AMGLVQ has better performance compared to Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Head trauma is known to affect the mechanisms that support the electrophysiological processing of information within and between brain regions, so methods like quantitative EEG may provide viable indices of brain dysfunction associated with even mTBI. Methods: Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data were obtained from 71 individuals with military-related mTBI and 82 normal comparison subjects without traumatic brain injury. All mTBI subjects were in the chronic period of injury (> 5 months since the time of injury). Quantitative metrics included absolute and relative power in delta, theta, alpha, beta, high beta, and gamma bands, plus a measure of interhemispheric coherence in each band. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods, the latter coupled to machine learning strategies. Results: Analyses revealed significant (P < 0.05) group level differences in global relative theta power (increased for mTBI patients), global relative alpha power (decreased for mTBI patients), and global beta-band interhemispheric coherence (decreased for mTBI patients). Single variables were limited in their ability to predict group membership (e.g., mTBI vs. control) for individual subjects, each with a predictive accuracy that was below 60%. In contrast, the combination of a multivariate approach with machine learning methods yielded a composite metric that provided an overall predictive accuracy of 75% for correct classification of individual subjects as coming from control versus mTBI groups. Conclusions: This study indicates that quantitative EEG methods may be useful in the identification, classification, and tracking of individual subjects with mTBI.

Hence, seizure classification is the primary task of this article. In this study, a nonlinear higher-order spectral method is proposed that significantly explore the underlying dynamics of nonstationary EEG signals. Various statistical parameters are measured from the principal region of the higher-order spectra that are subjected to the data reduction technique of the locality sensitive discriminant analysis (LSDA). The LSDA maps the measured features at higher dimensional space and ranks them according to the probability of discrimination. The ranked features are then used as inputs to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier with radial basis function kernel. The proposed algorithm is simulated on the web-available Bonn university database that achieved excellent seizures classification accuracy.

In a previous work, we introduced a method which accurately detected NCSz in EEG data (referred here as 'Batch method'). However, this approach was less effective when the EEG features identified at the beginning of the recording changed over time. Such pattern drift is an issue that causes failures of automated seizure detection methods. This paper presents a support vector machine (SVM)-based incremental learning method for NCSz detection that for the first time addresses the seizure evolution in EEG records from patients with epileptic disorders and from ICU having NCSz. To implement the incremental learning SVM, three methodologies are tested. These approaches differ in the way they reduce the set of potentially available support vectors that are used to build the decision function of the classifier. To evaluate the suitability of the three incremental learning approaches proposed here for NCSz detection, first, a comparative study between the three methods is performed. Secondly, the incremental learning approach with the best performance is compared with the Batch method and three other batch methods from the literature.

For classification experiments, high-gamma bandpower features and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are commonly used due to simplicity and robustness. However, LDA is inherently static and not suited to account for transient information that is typically present in high-gamma features. To resolve this issue, we here present an extension of LDA to the time-variant feature space. We call this method time-variant linear discriminant analysis (TVLDA). It intrinsically provides a feature reduction stage, whichmakes external approaches thereto obsolete, such as feature selection techniques or common spatial patterns (CSPs). As well, we propose a time-domain whitening stage which equalizes the pronounced 1/f-shape of the typical brain-wave spectrum. We evaluated our proposed architecture based on recordings from 15 epilepsy patients with temporarily implanted subdural grids, who participated in additional research experiments besides clinical treatment. The experiments featured two different motor tasks involving three high-level gestures and individual finger movement. We used log-transformed bandpower features from the high-gamma band (50-300 Hz, excluding power-line harmonics) for classification. On average, whitening improved the classification performance by about 11%. On whitened data, TVLDA outperformed LDA with feature selection by 11.8%, LDA with CSPs by 13.9%, and regularized LDA with vectorized features by 16.4%. At the same time, TVLDA only required one or two internal features to achieve this. TVLDA provides stable results even if very few trials are available. It is easy to implement, fully automatic and deterministic. Due to its low complexity, TVLDA is suited for real-time brain-computer interfaces. Training is done in less than a second. TVLDA performed particularly well in experiments with data from high-density electrode arrays. For example, the three high-level gestures were correctly identified at a rate of 99% over all subjects. Similarly, the decoding accuracy of individual fingers was 96% on average over all subjects. To our knowledge, these mean accuracies are the highest ever reported for three-class and five-class motor-control BCIs.

Four classes were to distinguish, i.e. imagining the movement of left hand, right hand, feet, or tongue. The dataset "2a" of BCI Competition IV (2008) was considered. Brain signals were processed by applying a short-time Fourier transform, a common spatial pattern filter for feature extraction, and a support vector machine for classification.

Specifically, SA and HY are the Steady-State Somatosensory Evoked potential (SSSEP) paradigms which elicit brain responses to tactile stimulation. One subject participated in two sessions (Screening and Study session). In the screening session, resonance-like frequency of the subject was found at each hand while sitting on a chair. In the study session, the subject was asked to imagine either left of right hand open-close movement (MI task), to give selective attention to the vibrotactile stimulation (SA task), and to perform combined MI and SA task (HY) according to a randomly assigned directional cue. The accuracies of 3 paradigms were MI-left 65.8%, MI-right 69.2% (mean: 67.5%), SA-left 76.6%, SA-right 84.0% (mean: 80.3%) and HY-left 93.8%, HY-right 95.9% (mean: 94.9%). The method and results of the current study could be a basis for controlling the left and right movement direction of an exoskeleton robot using EEG.

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems are one of the practical application of EEG signal. Response to mental task is a well-known type of BCI systems which augments the life of disabled persons to communicate their core needs to machines that can able to distinguish among mental states corresponding to thought responses to the EEG. The success of classification of these mental tasks depends on the pertinent set formation of features (analysis, extraction, and selection) of the EEG signals for the classification process. In the recent past, a filter-based heuristic technique, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), is employed to analyze EEG signal. EMD is a mathematical technique which is suitable to analyze a nonstationary and nonlinear signal such as EEG. In this work, three-stage feature set formation from EEG signal for building classification model is suggested to distinguish different mental states. In the first stage, the signal is broken into a number of oscillatory functions through EMD algorithm. The second stage involves compact representation in terms of eight different statistics (features) obtained from each oscillatory function. It has also observed that not all features are relevant, therefore, there is need to select most relevant features from the pool of the formed features which is carried out in the third stage. Four well-known univariate feature selection algorithms are investigated in combination with EMD algorithm for forming the feature vectors for further classification. Classification is carried out with help of learning the support vector machine (SVM) classification model. Experimental result on a publicly available dataset shows the superior performance of the proposed approach.

Various features can be derived from three distinctive domains (i.e., spatial, temporal and spectral); however, the efficacies of the existing feature extraction methods when discriminating complex multiclass MI tasks have yet to be reported. This study investigates the performances of EEG feature extraction techniques from varying domains against different levels of complex, multiclass MI tasks. Ten healthy volunteers underwent multiple complex MI tasks via a robotic arm (i.e., hand grasping and wrist twisting; grasp, spread, pronation and supination). The discrimination performances of various feature extraction (i.e., common spatial patterns (CSP), time domain parameters (TDP), and power spectral density (PSD)) and classification methods for EEG were tested to perform binary (hand grasping/wrist twisting), ternary ((A) grasp/spread/wrist twisting and (B) hand grasping/pronation/supination) and quaternary (grasp/spread/pronation/supination) discrimination. Based on the available data, the combination of shrinkage-regularized linear discriminant analysis (SRLDA) and TDP achieved the highest accuracy. The findings suggest that multiclass complex MI-BCI task discrimination could gain more benefit from analyzing simple and symbolic features such as TDP rather than more complex features such as CSP and PSD.

One common BCI paradigm is motor imagery in which the user controls a BCI by imagining movements of different body parts. It is known that imagining different body parts results in event-related desynchronization (ERD) in various frequency bands. Existing methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) and its refinement filterbank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) aim at finding features that are informative for classification of the motor imagery class. Our proposed method is a temporally adaptive common spatial patterns implementation of the commonly used filter-bank common spatial patterns method using convolutional neural networks; hence it is called TA-CSPNN. With this method we aim to: (1) make the feature extraction and classification end-to-end, (2) base it on the way CSP/FBCSP extracts relevant features, and finally, (3) reduce the number of trainable parameters compared to existing deep learning methods to improve generalizability in noisy data such as EEG. More importantly, we show that this reduction in parameters does not affect performance and in fact the trained network generalizes better for data from some participants. We show our results on two datasets, one publicly available from BCI Competition IV, dataset 2a and another in-house motor imagery dataset.

J	Tuncer, SA; Akdotu, B; Toraman, S				Tuncer, Seda Arslan; Akdotu, Beyza; Toraman, Suat			A deep learning-based decision support system for diagnosis of OSAS using PTT signals	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES			English	Article						OSAS; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep learning; PTT	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; CLASSIFICATION	Sleep disorders, which negatively affect an individual's daily quality of life, are a common problem for most of society. The most dangerous sleep disorder is obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), which manifests itself during sleep and can cause the sudden death of patients. Many important parameters related to the diagnosis and treatments of such sleep disorders are simultaneously examined. This process is exhausting and time-consuming for experts and also requires experience; thus, it can cause difference of opinion among experts. Because of this, automatic sleep staging systems have been designed. In this study, a decision support system was developed to determine OSAS patients. In the developed decision support system, unlike in the available published literature, patient and healthy individual classification was performed using only the Pulse Transition Time (PTT) parameter rather than other parameters obtained from polysomnographic data like ECG (Electrocardiogram), EEG (Electroencephalography), carbon dioxide measurement and EMG (Electromyography). The suggested method can perform feature extraction from PIT signals by means of a deep-learning method. AlexNet and VGG-16, which are two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, have been used for feature extraction. With the features obtained, patients and healthy individuals were classified by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms.

Instead of utilizing raw EEG channel data, we compute the joint variability of the channels in the form of a covariance matrix that provide spatio-temporal representations of EEG. The networks are trained hierarchically and the extracted features are passed onto the next network hierarchy until the final classification. Using a publicly available EEG based speech imagery database we demonstrate around 23.45% improvement of accuracy over the baseline method. Our approach demonstrates the promise of a mixed DNN approach for complex spatial-temporal classification problems.

Brain Machine Interface (BMI) is a part of bioengineering that connects brain with machine directly in order to command and control the machines. Recently, bioengineering researchers are employing BMI techniques to explore advance knowledge for discovering biological fundamental problems. In this paper, we have proposed an ensemble method to improve the prediction accuracy of real time electroencephalogram signals classification and developed a system that can distinguish different human thoughts. Initially, we have collected the brain signals, and then extracted and selected informative features from these signals to engender training and testing data. We have built several classifiers using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB) classifier, Bagging, Random Forest and compare the performance of these existing learning methods with proposed ensemble classifier. The proposed method achieved 99% and 79% accuracy on average 14 binary -class and ternary -class classification in compare with existing classifiers. Finally, we have applied the proposed ensemble classifier for developing a brain game that can control the ball using brain signal of voluntary movements without any need of conventional input devices.

Numerous methods have been proposed to fulfill this challenging task, including feature methods and machine learning methods. Recently, with the development of deep learning techniques, many studies achieved better results than traditional feature methods, and the combination of traditional methods and deep learning techniques gradually received attention. In this paper, we propose a recurrence network-based convolutional neural network (RN-CNN) method to detect fatigue driving. To be specific, we first conduct a simulated driving experiment to collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of subjects under alert state and fatigue state. Then, we construct the multiplex recurrence network (RN) from EEG signals to fuse information from the original time series. Finally, CNN is employed to extract and learn the features of a multiplex RN for realizing a classification task. The results indicate that the proposed RN-CNN method can achieve an average accuracy of 92.95%. To verify the effectiveness of our method, some existing competitive methods are compared with ours. The results show that our method outperforms the existing methods, which demonstrate the effect of the RN-CNN method. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

J	Zhao, XH; Zhao, JY; Cai, WM; Wu, SQ				Zhao, Xianghong; Zhao, Jieyu; Cai, Weiming; Wu, Shuangqing			Transferring Common Spatial Filters With Semi-Supervised Learning for Zero-Training Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; motor imagery; transfer learning; semi-supervised learning; common spatial pattern	SUBJECT TRANSFER; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ADAPTATION; PATTERN; SVM	Common spatial pattern (CSP) has been proved to be one of the most efficient feature-extracting methods for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), especially for motor imagery BCI. However, CSP is a supervised method and performs poorly when there are not enough labeled data. This paper aims to construct a minimum-training BCI, which means there are only a few labeled data, even none labeled data for target subjects. Under this condition, conventional CSP cannot work well. Therefore, source data (related labeled data from other subjects) are exploited and common filters across subjects are obtained using a clustering method. After that, features are extracted and a semi-supervised support vector machine which transfers knowledge across subjects is proposed. The experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. When there are none labeled data for target subjects, our algorithm outperforms two state-of-the-art algorithms in semi-supervised learning field, and as the amount of unlabeled data for target subjects becomes larger, the performance of our algorithm grows better and better, which is suitable for online use. When the amount of labeled data for target subjects (denoted as M in this paper) is small, our algorithm also shows its strength compared with corresponding outstanding algorithms. For dataset IVa of BCI competition III, our algorithm performs the best for all the subjects excluding "aw" when M = 20. Compared with counterparts, our method outperforms 6.6% for "aa," 19.3% for "al," 11.8% for "av," and 9.7% for "ay" on average, respectively. When M = 40, our method performs the best for "al" and "av". It averagely outperforms 8.0% for "al" and 15.3% for "av," respectively. For GigaDataset, averagely our method outperforms 4.4% for "sbj2," 5.0% for "sbj4," and 7.1% for "sbj5" when M = 20, respectively. When M = 40, our algorithm performs the best only for "sbj5." It averagely outperforms 8.6% compared with counterparts. Although the performances of our method are not the best for all the conditions, its performances are very robust and competitive.

EEGs are typically used to diagnose and monitor disorders such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, and brain death and also to help the advancement of various fields of science such as cognitive science, and psychology. EEG signals usually suffer from a variety of artifacts caused by eye movements, chewing, muscle movements, and electrode pops, which disrupts the diagnosis and hinders precise representation of brain activities. This paper proposes a deep learning based model to detect the presence of the artifacts and to classify the kind of the artifact to help clinicians resolve problems regarding artifacts immediately during the signal collection process. The model is optimized to map the 1-second segments of raw EEG signals to detect 4 different kinds of artifacts and the real signal. The model achieves a 5-class classification accuracy of 67.59%, and a true positive rate of 80% with a 25.82% false alarm for binary artifact classification with time-lapse. The model is lightweight and could potentially be deployed in portable machines.

Besides this, the EEG-based automatic recognition of alcoholics greatly supports to the psychiatrists. However, one of the major challenges when using EEG is about storing and transmitting a huge amount of EEG data, leading to the need of using compression. Although lossy compression techniques give much higher compression ratio (CR) than lossless ones, they introduce the loss of information including the age, gender and alcoholic information in the reconstructed signals, which may reduce the performance of EEG-based age, gender and alcoholic recognition systems significantly. In this paper, the impact of lossy compression on the age, gender and alcoholic information extracted from EEG signals is examined in detail with different feature extraction and machine learning techniques. Our experimental results indicate that with an appropriate feature extraction technique, we could minimize the information loss in EEG compression and maintain the high performance of EEG-based age, gender and alcoholics recognition systems.

Using electroencephalography (EEG) as a biomarker for speech decoding has been popular for SSR. However, the lack of SSR text corpus has impeded the development of this technique. Here, we construct a novel task-oriented text corpus, which is utilized in the field of SSR. In the process of construction, we propose a task-oriented hybrid construction method based on natural language generation (NLG) algorithm. The algorithm focuses on the strategy of data-to-text generation, and has two advantages including linguistic quality and high diversity. These two advantages use template-based method and deep neural networks respectively. In an SSR experiment with the generated text corpus, analysis results show that the performance of our hybrid construction method outperforms the pure method such as template-based natural language generation or neural natural language generation models.

While these studies provided proof-of-concept of this approach as a highly promising avenue in the field of HRI, a systematic understanding of the dyadic interacting system (human and machine) remained unexplored. This research aims to address this gap by proposing a computational model of the human counterpart and simulating the integrated dyadic system. The model can be employed for the systematic study of both human behavioral and technical factors influencing co-adaptation as exemplarily demonstrated in this paper for hypothetical variations of ErrP-decoder performance. The obtained findings have practical implications for future steps along this line of research, for instance to what extent and how improvements of ErrP-decoder performance can benefit co-adaptation in ErrP-based HRI. The proposed computational model enables the prediction of human behavior in the context of ErrP-based HRI. As such it allows the simulation of future empirical studies prior to their conductance and thereby providing a means for accelerating progress along this line of research in a resource-saving manner.

Basically, an SVM classifier is calculated for each frequency in the periodogram and a proposed weighting system, based on the error rate of each SVM classifier, is used to obtain a final decision value. Also, it is shown that principal component analysis can be used to identify the best group of EEG channels to apply to the classification method, improving the correct classification rate. Two applications with real data are presented. The first application uses a public data set of epileptic patients and compares the proposed method with other methods presented in the literature. In this case, the correct classification rate obtained was 100%. The second application consists of EEG data collected from a subject submitted to 10 visual stimuli and the correct classification rate obtained was 95.31%. The classifier WFF-SVM combines multiple existing techniques, each one of them widely used in time series and dimensionality reduction problems. Our paper combines standard signal processing techniques to obtain high classification rates of EEG data.	[de Carvalho, Jhonnata B.; de Pinho, Andre L.

The ensemble of graphs signals corresponding to a multi-trial training dataset is then analyzed using a graph-guided decomposition and, based on discriminative Lasso (dLasso), an information-rich GFT subspace is defined. After training, only simple matrix operations are required for transforming the multichannel signal into features to be fed into a classifier that decides whether brain activity conforms with the graph structure associated with the targeted movement. The proposed decoding scheme is evaluated based on two different datasets and found to compare favorably against popular alternatives in the field.

J	Amiri, M; Frauscher, B; Gotman, J				Amiri, Mina; Frauscher, Birgit; Gotman, Jean			Interictal coupling of HFOs and slow oscillations predicts the seizure-onset pattern in mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						intracranial EEG; low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spiking; low-voltage fast activity; phase-amplitude coupling	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP; PHASE; SPIKES; ZONE; HZ; MODULATION; RIPPLES; MARKER	Objective Low-voltage fast activity (LVF) and low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spiking (PS) are the two most common seizure-onset patterns in mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy, with different underlying mechanisms, pathology, and postsurgical outcome. The present work aims to investigate whether specific coupling patterns of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs >80 Hz) and low-frequency waves in the interictal period may distinguish these two patterns, and also seizure-onset zone (SOZ) from non-SOZ as a secondary aim. Methods We used intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data (during non-rapid eye movement [NREM] sleep) of 18 patients with either LVF or PS seizure-onset patterns. We investigated the interaction between HFOs (ripples: 80-250 Hz and fast ripples: >250 Hz) and slow oscillations (slow-delta, delta, and theta waves). We compared classic features (amplitude, duration, frequency, and power) and phase of coupling between HFOs and slower oscillations inside and outside the SOZ. We then used these features to classify HFOs and subsequently patients into LVF and PS groups. Results Ripples in the LVF group had significantly longer duration, lower frequency, and higher amplitude than in the PS group. The phase of slow oscillations at which HFOs occur is different between the LVF and PS HFOs (LVF, mostly at the peak or the transition of peak to trough; PS, mostly during the transition of trough to peak). HFOs associated with theta waves best discriminate seizure-onset patterns. The coupling phase improves the classification of HFOs and patients to either LVF or PS groups, and also the classification of HFOs in SOZ and non-SOZ. Significance The phase of coupling of HFOs and low-frequency waves may help to not only identify the SOZ, but also to classify patients with different types of seizure-onset patterns. It likely reflects that different disease processes are involved in these patterns during the interictal period.

This paper presents the Technology Integrated Apnea Respiration Analyser (TIARA), an innovative wearable device as an alternative to polysomnography (PSG) that has the potential to enable cost-effective and repeated overnight tests of OSA even in a home environment. PSG normally collects bio-signals such as brain waves, oxygen saturation, heart rate in a controlled environment (e.g. sleep lab) to diagnose sleep disorders. Here we present the design and development of the TIARA device and demonstrate its potential to perform as well as PSG at differentiating sleep and wake states and different phases of sleep, based on machine learning models.

In this regard, several studies make an effort to recognize individuals' stress using an Electroencephalogram (EEG). However, current EEG-based stress recognition frameworks have several drawbacks. First, they are mostly designed to recognize individuals' stress only in a controlled laboratory environment. Second, they do not take into account the changes in the EEG signals of different subjects under the same stressors. Third, most of the current stress recognition algorithms occur in an offline setting. To address these issues, this study proposes an EEG-based stress recognition framework that takes into account each subject's brainwave patterns to train the stress recognition classifier and continuously update its classifier based on new input signals in near real-time. The proposed framework first removes EEG signal artifacts, then extracts a broad range of EEG signal features, and finally applies different online multitask learning (OMTL) algorithms to recognize individuals' stress in near real time. The proposed framework was applied on the EEG collected in two environments-first on the EEG collected in a controlled lab environment using a wired-EEG and second on the EEG collected at in the field using a wearable EEG device. The OMTL-VonNeuman method resulted in the best prediction accuracy on both datasets (71.14% on the first dataset and 77.61% on second) among all tested algorithms. The proposed stress recognition framework continuously updates its classifier and therefore contributes to stress recognition for new stressful situations that are beyond the range of predefined stressful conditions in near real time both in a controlled lab environment and at real job sites.

Therefore, it is necessary to extract and discriminate signal features involving motor imagery movements. Riemannian geometry-based feature extraction methods are effective when designing these types of motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface applications. In the field of information theory, Riemannian geometry is mainly used with covariance matrices. Accordingly, investigations showed that if the method is used after the execution of the filterbank approach, the covariance matrix preserves the frequency and spatial information of the signal. Deep-learning methods are superior when the data availability is abundant and while there is a large number of features. The purpose of this study is to a) show how to use a single deep-learning-based classifier in conjunction with BCI (brain-computer interface) applications with the CSP (common spatial features) and the Riemannian geometry feature extraction methods in BCI applications and to b) describe one of the wrapper feature-selection algorithms, referred to as the particle swarm optimization, in combination with a decision tree algorithm. In this work, the CSP method was used for a multiclass case by using only one classifier. Additionally, a combination of power spectrum density features with covariance matrices mapped onto the tangent space of a Riemannian manifold was used. Furthermore, the particle swarm optimization method was implied to ease the training by penalizing bad features, and the moving windows method was used for augmentation. After empirical study, the convolutional neural network was adopted to classify the pre-processed data. Our proposed method improved the classification accuracy for several subjects that comprised the well-known BCI competition IV 2a dataset.

A simple Normalization of data in the scale [0, 1] without attributing special importance to specific sub-intervals in [0, 1] results in significant loss in information, which cannot be retrieved otherwise to identify the proposer class of a given data point. This paper attempts to represent n-dimensional data point patterns into quantized fuzzy vectors of 3n dimensions. As the class information for all the data points of the training instances are known, a majority voting over (the individual quantized fuzzy) components of the data points in a class effectively returns an approximate centroidal measure of the data points lying in the same class. The concatenation of such majority-voted components of the data points in a class represents the class centroid of the respective class. The class centroids thus obtained are saved to determine the class of an unknown data point. The classification of an unknown data point here is performed in two steps. First the unknown data point is quantized in fuzzy space similarly as for the training data, and the resulting quantized fuzzy vector is projected along all the unit class centroid vectors of all known classes. In case the projection along the k-th unit class centroid vector is the largest, then the class of the unknown data point is regarded as k. The proposed principle has successfully been applied in classification of olfactory stimuli from the acquired EEG signals of the subjects and the classification performance is found to be superior with respect to the existing state-of-the art algorithms.

Vigilance detection has been an important topic in the field of brain-computer interface (BCI) research. However, the study is limited due to the low SNR (Signal-Noise Ratio) nature of EEG. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a one of the most effective algorithms for feature extraction method in the BCI study area. The CSP seeks for an optimal projection direction (spatial filter) by maximizing the variance of one class and simultaneously minimizing the variance of the other class. There is one drawbacks exists in the traditional CSP, that is, the CSP is proposed relies on the assumption that data in each class follow the Gaussian distribution. However, this assumption is not always true for EEG data in practice, especially in the research of vigilance detection based EEG (e.g. during sleep). Thus, traditional CSP suffers performance degradation in case of non-Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we extend the traditional CSP to the general version and proposed nonparametric CSP (NCSP) algorithms which do not explicitly rely on the assumption of the underlying class Gaussian distribution and we then develop a new efficient algorithm based on matrix deflation to solve the proposed NCSP algorithm and its extensions-nonparametric multi-class CSP (NMCSP). Experimental results on EEG-based vigilance estimation and motor imagery recognition task demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

Estimation of multilevel cognitive workload is a task usually realized in a subject-dependent way, while the present research is focused on developing the procedure of subject-independent evaluation of cognitive workload level. The aim of the paper is to estimate cognitive workload level in accordance with subject-independent approach, applying classical machine learning methods combined with feature selection techniques. The procedure of data acquisition was based on registering the EEG signal of the person performing arithmetical tasks divided into six intervals of advancement. The analysis included the stages of preprocessing, feature extraction, and selection, while the final step covered multiclass classification performed with several models.

J	Yue, K; Wang, DL				Yue, Kang; Wang, Danli			EEG-Based 3D Visual Fatigue Evaluation Using CNN	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						EEG; visual fatigue; CNN	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DISPLAYS; FMRI	Visual fatigue evaluation plays an important role in applications such as virtual reality since the visual fatigue symptoms always affect the user experience seriously. Existing visual evaluation methods require hand-crafted features for classification, and conduct feature extraction and classification in a separated manner. In this paper, we conduct a designed experiment to collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of various visual fatigue levels, and present a multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture named MorletInceptionNet to detect visual fatigue using EEG as input, which exploits the spatial-temporal structure of multichannel EEG signals. Our MorletInceptionNet adopts a joint space-time-frequency features extraction scheme in which Morlet wavelet-like kernels are used for time-frequency raw feature extraction and inception architecture are further used to extract multi-scale temporal features. Then, the multi-scale temporal features are concatenated and fed to the fully connected layer for visual fatigue evaluation using classification. In experiment evaluation, we compare our method with five state-of-the-art methods, and the results demonstrate that our model achieve overally the best performance better performance for two widely used evaluation metrics, i.e., classification accuracy and kappa value. Furthermore, we use input-perturbation network-prediction correlation maps to conduct in-depth analysis into the reason why the proposed method outperforms other methods. The results suggest that our model is sensitive to the perturbation of beta (14-30 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) bands. Furthermore, their spatial patterns are of high correlation with that of the corresponding power spectral densities which are used as evaluation features traditionally. This finding provides evidence of the hypothesis that the proposed model can learn the joint time-frequency-space features to distinguish fatigue levels automatically.

However, CSP is also very susceptive to the selection of the filter bands, the time windows, and the channels. In this paper, we proposed a novel regularized CSP (RCSP) method to optimize feature extraction in MI-BCI. Then, a robust classifier based on AdaBoost algorithm was presented to perform the classification of MI tasks. Finally, the framework was verified on two public BCI datasets (dataset 1 from the BCI Competition IV and dataset IVa from BCI Competition III). The results suggest the proposed approach achieved superior performance compared with classical CSP and other competing methods. Overall, this method not only improved classification performance, but also reduced the data requirements of other subjects.

In this paper, an efficient and flexible diagnostic method is proposed, which enables the simultaneous use of a machine learning method and sparsity-based representation technique. Specifically, the proposed method is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and generalized minimax-concave (GMC) method. First, measured potential signals, for instance, electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are directly inputted into the designed network based on CNN for health conditions classification. The designed network adopts small convolution kernels to enhance the performance of feature extraction. In the training process, small batch samples are applied to improve the generalization of the model. Meanwhile, the "Dropout" strategy is applied to overcome the overfitting problem in fully connected layers. Then, for a record of the interested EEG or ECG signal, the sparse representation of useful time-frequency features can be estimated via the GMC method. Case studies of seizure detection and arrhythmia signal analysis are adopted to verify the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify different health conditions and maximally enhance the sparsity of time-frequency features.

A Computationally Efficient Model for Predicting Successful Memory Encoding Using Machine-Learning-based EEG Channel Selection	2019 9TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE/EMBS International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAR 20-23, 2019	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMBS				Computational cost is an important consideration for memory encoding prediction models that use data from dozens of implanted electrodes. We propose a method to reduce computational expense by selecting a subset of all the electrodes to build the prediction model. The electrodes were selected based on their likelihood of measuring brain activity useful for predicting memory encoding better than chance (in terms of AUC). A logistic regression prediction model was built using spectral features of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from the selected electrodes. We demonstrate our method on iEEG data from 37 human subjects performing free recall verbal short-term memory tasks. The method achieves a 36.3% reduction in the number of electrodes used for prediction, resulting in a 64.9 % reduction in inference computation time with just a 0.3 % loss in prediction performance compared to the case when all electrodes were used. The electrodes selected using our method provided improved prediction performance compared to those electrodes that were not selected in 31 out of 37 patients. Building upon this observation, we also developed a method to identify the subjects for whom the proposed electrode selection method would be beneficial.

Based on k-means++ algorithm, the network allows each dendrite to build a hyperellipsoidal in order to assign each incoming pattern x(i) = (x(1), x(2), . . . , x(n))(T) to its respective C class. The main disadvantage of this training algorithm is the lack of accuracy in high dimensional datasets. In this research, we solved this problem by training the dendrite ellipsoidal neuron using stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, electroencephalography data were acquired during two mental conditions (imaginary movements of the left and right hand) in order to test the new training algorithm. The proposed algorithm outperformed the accuracy acquired by a dendrite ellipsoidal neuron based on k-means++ obtaining 76.02% and 62.77%, respectively. Also, the algorithm was compared with multilayer perceptrons and support vector machines which are some of the most common classifiers used to detect motor-related information in brain signals. These achieved an accuracy of 72.38% and 65.81%, respectively.

To alleviate the influence of culture dependent elicitation materials and evoke desired human emotions, we specifically collect an emotion elicitation material database selected from more than 1500 video clips. By the considerable amount of strict man-made labeling, we elaborately choose 28 videos as standardized elicitation samples, which are assessed by psychological methods. The physiological signals of participants were synchronously recorded when they watched these standardized video clips that described six discrete emotions and neutral emotion. With three types of classification protocols, different feature extraction methods and classifiers (support vector machine and k-NearestNeighbor) were used to recognize the physiological responses of different emotions, which presented the baseline results. Simultaneously, we present a novel attention-long short-term memory (A-LSTM), which strengthens the effectiveness of useful sequences to extract more discriminative features. In addition, correlations between the EEG signals and the participants' ratings are investigated. The database has been made publicly available to encourage other researchers to use it to evaluate their own emotion estimation methods.

This chapter reviews the classifications, phenomenology, neural correlates, and mechanisms of meditation. Meditation classification types are still varied and largely subjective. Broader models to describe meditation practice along multidimensional parameters may improve classification in the future. Phenomenological studies are few but growing, highlighting the subjective experience and correlations to neurophysiology. Oscillatory EEG studies are not conclusive likely due to the heterogeneous nature of the meditation styles and practitioners being assessed. Neuroimaging studies find common patterns during meditation and in long-term meditators reflecting the basic similarities of meditation in general; however, mostly the patterns differ across unique meditation traditions. Research on the mechanisms of meditation, specifically attention and emotion regulation is also discussed. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating positive benefits from meditation in some clinical populations especially for stress reduction, anxiety, depression, and pain improvement, although future research would benefit by addressing the remaining methodological and conceptual issues. Meditation research continues to grow allowing us to understand greater nuances of how meditation works and its effects.

We proposed a brain-computer interface (BCI) based visual-haptic neurofeedback training (NFT) by incorporating synchronous visual scene and proprioceptive electrical stimulation feedback. The goal of this work was to improve sensorimotor cortical activations and classification performance during motor imagery (MI). In addition, their correlations and brain network patterns were also investigated respectively. Approach. 64-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in nineteen healthy subjects during MI before and after NFT. During NFT sessions, the synchronous visual-haptic feedbacks were driven by real-time lateralized relative event-related desynchronization (lrERD). Main results. By comparison between previous and posterior control sessions, the cortical activations measured by multi-band (i.e. alpha_1 : 8-10 Hz, alpha_2 : 11-13 Hz, beta_1 : 15-20 Hz and beta_2 : 22-28 Hz) absolute ERD powers and lrERD patterns were significantly enhanced after the NFT. The classification performance was also significantly improved, achieving a similar to 9% improvement and reaching similar to 85% in mean classification accuracy from a relatively poor performance. Additionally, there were significant correlations between lrERD patterns and classification accuracies. The partial directed coherence based functional connectivity (FC) networks covering the sensorimotor area also showed an increase after the NFT. Significance. These findings validate the feasibility of our proposed NFT to improve sensorimotor cortical activations and BCI performance during motor imagery. And it is promising to optimize conventional NFT manner and evaluate the effectiveness of motor training.

Wearable exoskeleton outside the body, combined with the organic body, plays a role in the protection and support. By wearing an exoskeleton robot, it is possible to expand the wearer's athletic ability, increase muscle endurance, and enable the wearer to complete tasks that he or she cannot perform under natural conditions. Based on the above advantages, the exoskeleton robot in military medical care and rehabilitation has broad application prospects. This paper describes the multimodal model of machine learning research status and research significance of the text on the exoskeleton robot applications, and on the basis of a detailed study of gait. It mainly involves: analysis and planning and obtaining motion information processing, pattern recognition and analysis of gait and the gait conversion process, and the EEG and joint position, foot pressure, such as different modes of data as input to machine learning models to improve the timeliness, accuracy and safety of gait planning. Since the common movement process involves the transformation process of gait, this paper studies the gait transformation process including squatting, walking on the ground and standing.

J	Kadosh, KC; Staunton, G				Kadosh, Kathrin Cohen; Staunton, Graham			A systematic review of the psychological factors that influence neurofeedback learning outcomes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review							REAL-TIME FMRI; EMOTION REGULATION; SELF-REGULATION; INTERHEMISPHERIC ASYMMETRY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; SCALE; QUESTIONNAIRE; PREDICTORS; PAIN	Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based neurofeedback represents the latest applied behavioural neuroscience methodology developed to train participants in the self-regulation of brain regions or networks. However, as with previous biofeedback approaches which rely on electroencephalography (EEG) or related approaches such as brain-machine interface technology (BCI), individual success rates vary significantly, and some participants never learn to control their brain responses at all. Given that these approaches are often being developed for eventual use in a clinical setting (albeit there is also significant interest in using NF for neuro-enhancement in typical populations), this represents a significant hurdle which requires more research. Here we present the findings of a systematic review which focused on how psychological variables contribute to learning outcomes in fMRI-based neurofeedback. However, as this is a relatively new methodology, we also considered findings from EEG-based neurofeedback and BCI. 271 papers were found and screened through PsycINFO, psycARTICLES, Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Collection, ISI Web of Science and Medline and 21 were found to contribute towards the aim of this survey. Several main categories emerged: Attentional variables appear to be of importance to both performance and learning, motivational factors and mood have been implicated as moderate predictors of success, while personality factors have mixed findings. We conclude that future research will need to systematically manipulate psychological variables such as motivation or mood, and to define clear thresholds for a successful neurofeedback effect. Non-responders need to be targeted for interventions and tested with different neurofeedback setups to understand whether their non-response is specific or general. Also, there is a need for qualitative evidence to understand how psychological variables influence participants throughout their training. This will help us to understand the subtleties of psychological effects over time. This research will allow interventions to be developed for non-responders and better selection procedures in future to improve the efficacy of neurofeedback.

EEG signal is usually buried in noise and has very low signal to noise ratio (SNR), which has presented great challenge for efficient motor imagery classification. In addition, the large intra-subject and inter-subject signal variance toward one specific motor imagery also brings difficulty for accurate classification. In recent years, some deep learning solutions based on AutoEncoder, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, CNN and RNN have been proposed for EEG motor imagery classification which have well improved the motor imagery classification accuracy. However, the multi-subject and multi-task motor imagery classification problem remains a challenge. The high computational cost of the existing deep learning solutions is another serious issue to be addressed. In this paper, a new motor imagery classification solution based on Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is developed. The dilated causal convolution within TCN could well incorporate the temporal information in a parallel way with much higher computational efficiency than the traditional RNNs. Time stacked spatial EEG signal has been employed as the input to the TCN. Based on which, both the spatial distribution information and temporal variation of the brain signal have been considered. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed TCN solution has obtained state of the art performance on multi-subject and multi-task motor imagery classification. A high classification accuracy as 97.89% on 20 subjects and 5 tasks has been reached.

Use of Continuous EEG Monitoring in Children Presenting With Encephalopathy Following Convulsive Status Epilepticus	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Continuous EEG; Pediatric critical care; Status epilepticus		Purpose: The Critical Care Continuous EEG Task Force of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society recommends continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring in patients with persistent encephalopathy following convulsive status epilepticus. This recommendation is based on data, which correlates prolonged nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus with worse neurologic outcomes. Compliance with these recommendations may be limited by barriers such as inadequate resource and staff availability. We surveyed members of the Child Neurology Society to determine the barriers that prevent them from appropriately using cEEG, and how they have successfully overcome such obstacles. Methods: A survey was electronically distributed to Child Neurology Society members, which assessed demographics, current clinical practices, and cEEG utilization in critically ill children, with an emphasis on resource availability and strategies to overcome resource limitations. Results: One hundred forty-six physicians from Child Neurology Society completed the survey. Fifty-three (39.8%) respondents use cEEG to detect nonconvulsive seizures/nonconvulsive status epilepticus in most (> 90%) of their pediatric patients who present with persistent encephalopathy following convulsive status epilepticus. Forty-four respondents (34.4%) perceive barriers to performing cEEG monitoring, and 107 (84.9%) of the respondents are implementing changes to overcome barriers. The two most commonly reported barriers included inadequate availability of technicians and EEG machines. The most common changes included hiring new EEG technologists and purchasing new machines. Other barriers included identification of appropriate patients and availability of remote EEG monitoring capabilities. Conclusions: Barriers, such as resource limitations, prevent compliance with the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society cEEG monitoring recommendations. Recognizing common limitations and learning from each other about successful strategies to overcome these barriers may improve care.	[Yuliati, Asri; Weber, Amanda R.

The present paper is devoted to the study of the relationship of mental processes and the perception of external stimuli related to the previous musical education. The experimental set under study included 38 individuals who were observed during perception of music and during listening to foreign languages in four stages, each of which was 5 min long. The proposed methodology is based on the application of digital signal processing methods, signal filtering, statistical methods for signal segment selection and active electrode detection. Neural networks and support vector machine (SVM) models are then used to classify the selected groups of linguists to groups with and without a previous musical education. Our results include mean classification accuracies of 82.9% and 82.4% (with the mean cross-validation errors of 0.21 and 0.22, respectively) for perception of language or music and features based upon EEG power in the beta and gamma EEG frequency bands using neural network and SVM classification models.

In this paper, we propose the optimal channel selection using EEG channel covariance matrix and cross-combining region. First, the discriminative H channels and target channel are selected by difference of EEG channel covariance matrix between two classes. Second, we configure several sub-channel regions to cover the H channels. Then, we extract FBCSP features from cross-combining regions which are combination of the sub-channel regions and target channel. We select the best one cross-combining region and the optimal channels which are included in selected cross-combining region are finally selected. The features of selected region are used as input of LS-SVM classifier. The simulation results show the performance improvement of proposed method for BCI competition III dataset IVa by comparing the conventional channel selection methods.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of non-focal (NF) and focal (F) types contain brain activity information that can be used to identify areas affected by seizures. Generally, F EEG signals are recorded from the epileptic part of the brain, while NF EEG signals are recorded from brain regions unaffected by epilepsy. It is essential to correctly detect F EEG signals, when and where they occur, as focal epilepsy can be successfully treated by surgical means. However, all EEG signals are complex and require highly trained personnel for right interpretation. To overcome the associated challenges, in this study a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to aid in the detection of F EEG signals has been developed, and the performance of nonlinear features for differentiating F and NF EEG signals is compared. Moreover, it is noted that nonlinear features can effectively capture concealed patterns and rhythms contained in the EEG signals. Overall, it was found that the CAD system will be useful to clinicians in providing an accurate and objective paradigm for localization of the epileptogenic area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Noninvasive neuroimaging enhances continuous neural tracking for robotic device control	SCIENCE ROBOTICS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; MOVEMENT; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; QUALITY; PATIENT; PEOPLE; SIGNAL	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using signals acquired with intracortical implants have achieved successful high-dimensional robotic device control useful for completing daily tasks. However, the substantial amount of medical and surgical expertise required to correctly implant and operate these systems greatly limits their use beyond a few clinical cases. A noninvasive counterpart requiring less intervention that can provide high-quality control would profoundly improve the integration of BCIs into the clinical and home setting. Here, we present and validate a noninvasive framework using electroencephalography (EEG) to achieve the neural control of a robotic device for continuous random target tracking. This framework addresses and improves upon both the "brain" and "computer" components by increasing, respectively, user engagement through a continuous pursuit task and associated training paradigm and the spatial resolution of noninvasive neural data through EEG source imaging. In all, our unique framework enhanced BCI learning by nearly 60% for traditional center-out tasks and by more than 500% in the more realistic continuous pursuit task. We further demonstrated an additional enhancement in BCI control of almost 10% by using online noninvasive neuroimaging. Last, this framework was deployed in a physical task, demonstrating a near-seamless transition from the control of an unconstrained virtual cursor to the real-time control of a robotic arm. Such combined advances in the quality of neural decoding and the practical utility of noninvasive robotic arm control will have major implications for the eventual development and implementation of neurorobotics by means of noninvasive BCI.

A Portable Wireless Device for Cyclic Alternating Pattern Estimation from an EEG Monopolar Derivation	ENTROPY			English	Article						sleep quality; EEG; CAP; GRU; LSTM; 1D-CNN	AUTOMATIC METHOD; SLEEP; CAP; CLASSIFICATION	Quality of sleep can be assessed by analyzing the cyclic alternating pattern, a long-lasting periodic activity that is composed of two alternate electroencephalogram patterns, which is considered to be a marker of sleep instability. Experts usually score this pattern through a visual examination of each one-second epoch of an electroencephalogram signal, a repetitive and time-consuming task that is prone to errors. To address these issues, a home monitoring device was developed for automatic scoring of the cyclic alternating pattern by analyzing the signal from one electroencephalogram derivation. Three classifiers, specifically, two recurrent networks (long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit) and one one-dimension convolutional neural network, were developed and tested to determine which was more suitable for the cyclic alternating pattern phase's classification. It was verified that the network based on the long short-term memory attained the best results with an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of, respectively, 76%, 75%, 77% and 0.752. The classified epochs were then fed to a finite state machine to determine the cyclic alternating pattern cycles and the performance metrics were 76%, 71%, 84% and 0.778, respectively. The performance achieved is in the higher bound of the experts' expected agreement range and considerably higher than the inter-scorer agreement of multiple experts, implying the usability of the device developed for clinical analysis.

We design a SSMVEP-based BCI, in which a ring-shaped motion checkerboard pattern is used to realize SSMVEP stimulation. In particular, we firstly conduct SSMVEP experiments to obtain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from 10 subjects, including 5 EEG literates and 5 EEG illiterates. By using the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, we find that the classification accuracies of EEG illiterates are relatively lower than that of EEG literates. Thus, in order to investigate the differences in brain cognitive processes between the two groups of subjects, we construct a multivariate weighted recurrence network and analyze the weighted local efficiency and the clustering coefficient of the two groups. The results indicate that in SSMVEP experiment, there are significant differences between the two groups of subjects in these two network indicators. Our approach and analysis provide novel insights into the cognitive behavior of the brain and understanding of the "BCI Illiteracy" problem.

We report here motifs hidden in the EEG signal that predict the appearance of Iso-Electric Suppressions (IES), observed during epileptic encephalopathies, drug intoxications, comatose, brain death or during anesthetic over-dosage that are considered to be detrimental. To show that IES occurrences can be predicted from EEG traces dynamics, we focus on transient suppression of the alpha rhythm (8-14 Hz) recorded for 80 patients, that had a Propofol target controlled infusion of 5 mu g/ml during a general anesthesia. We found that the first time of appearance as well as changes in duration of these Alpha-Suppressions (alpha S) are two parameters that anticipate the appearance of IES. Using machine learning, we predicted IES appearance from the first 10 min of EEG (AUC of 0.93). To conclude, transient motifs in the alpha rhythm predict IES during anesthesia and can be used to identify patients, with higher risks of post-operative complications.

Exploiting Graphoelements and Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short Term Memory for Classification of the Human Electroencephalogram	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RELIABILITY	The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cornerstone of neurophysiological research and clinical neurology. Historically, the classification of EEG as showing normal physiological or abnormal pathological activity has been performed by expert visual review. The potential value of unbiased, automated EEG classification has long been recognized, and in recent years the application of machine learning methods has received significant attention. A variety of solutions using convolutional neural networks (CNN) for EEG classification have emerged with impressive results. However, interpretation of CNN results and their connection with underlying basic electrophysiology has been unclear. This paper proposes a CNN architecture, which enables interpretation of intracranial EEG (iEEG) transients driving classification of brain activity as normal, pathological or artifactual. The goal is accomplished using CNN with long short-term memory (LSTM). We show that the method allows the visualization of iEEG graphoelements with the highest contribution to the final classification result using a classification heatmap and thus enables review of the raw iEEG data and interpret the decision of the model by electrophysiology means.

In this 19-participant lab study, we use off-the-shelf BCIs to investigate password memorability and recall. We record electroencephalogram (EEG) potentials collected by BCIs upon presenting passwords of different characteristics to participants while asking them to memorize these passwords, and then recall them. Features from the EEG signals are extracted in three domains: power spectrum from the frequency domain, statistics from the time domain, and wavelet coefficients from the time-frequency domain. Lasso feature selection method is used, and the selected parameters and feature subsets are submitted for classification with two classes, recalled and not recalled, based on the user's subsequent recall of the passwords. Results show discriminating features of EEG signals in the two different classes, achieving a classification accuracy of 88%. Our results indicate that it may be possible to predict subsequent password recall based on EEG activity during password presentation.

J	Wei, XY; Zhou, L; Zhang, Z; Chen, ZY; Zhou, Y				Wei, Xiaoyan; Zhou, Lin; Zhang, Zhen; Chen, Ziyi; Zhou, Yi			Early prediction of epileptic seizures using a long-term recurrent convolutional network	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Epilepsy; Seizure forecast; Long-term recurrent convolutional network		Background: A seizure prediction system can detect seizures prior to their occurrence and allow clinicians to provide timely treatment for patients with epilepsy. Research on seizure prediction has progressed from signal processing analyses to machine learning. However, most prediction methods are hand-engineered and have high computational complexity, increasing the difficulty of obtaining real-time predictions. Some forecasting and early warning methods have achieved good results in the short term but have low applicability in practical situations over the long term. New methods: First, electroencephalogram (EEG) time series were converted into two-dimensional images for multichannel fusion. A feasible method, a long-term recurrent convolutional network (LRCN), was proposed to create a spatiotemporal deep learning model for predicting epileptic seizures. The convolutional network block was used to automatically extract deep features from the data. The long short-term memory (LSTM) block was incorporated into learning a time sequence for identifying the preictal segments. New network settings and a postprocessing strategy were proposed in the seizure prediction model. Results: The deep seizure prediction model achieved an accuracy of 93.40%, prediction sensitivity of 91.88% and specificity of 86.13% in segment-based evaluations. For the event-based evaluations, 164 seizures were predicted. The proposed method provides high sensitivity and a low false prediction rate (FPR) of 0.04 F P/h. Comparison with existing methods: We employed different methods, including the LRCN, deep learning and traditional machine learning methods, and compared them using the same data in this paper. Overall, the LRCN offers approximately 5-9% increased sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: This study describes the LRCN network for analyzing EEG data to predict epileptic seizures, thereby enabling the implementation of an early warning system that detects epileptic seizures before they occur in clinical applications.

This study introduces an optimum allocation based sampling (OAS) scheme to discover the most favourable representative data points from every single time-window of each EEG signal considering the minimal variability of the observations. Combining all representative samples of each time-window in a set, some statistical features are extracted from every set of each class. The Mann-Whitney U test is used to assess whether each of the features is significant between the two classes (e.g., alcoholic and control). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the OAS-based features, four well-known machine learning methods (decision table, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and logistic regression) are considered for identification of alcoholic brain state. The experimental results on the UCI KDD (i.e., UCI knowledge discovery in databases) database demonstrate that the OAS based decision table algorithm yields the highest accuracy of 99.58% with a low false alarm rate 0.40%, which is an improvement of up to 9.58% over the existing algorithms. A proposed analysis system can be used to detect alcoholism and also to determine the level of alcoholism-related changes in EEG signals.

In recent years, deep learning technology has achieved remarkable results in the BCI system, especially the using of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) frameworks for the identification and analysis of motor imagery signals. However, practical applications are limited by the complex process of data representation, and the end-to-end method will deteriorate the recognition results. In this paper, we propose a densely feature fusion convolutional neural networks (DFFN). Combining the morphological information of EEG signals, we propose two data representation methods with low complexity, then design and optimize the densely feature fusion network framework for this form of inputs. DFFN considers the correlation between adjacent layers and cross layer features, which reduces the information loss in the process of convolutional operation and considers the local and global characteristics of the network. The simulation results showed that our network improve classification results by 5% in the BCI competition IV-2a data set compare to the ordinary CNNs framework. In order to verify the practical application of the densely feature fusion network framework, we train an adaptive global model method. The results of average classification are close to the baseline approach of the subject-dependent model and better than others.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) favorably provides the measure. Wavelet coherence, which is a wavelet transform based feature that provides useful information regarding synchronized activity between two signals. It does not depend on the stationarity of the signal and hence very much relevant for non-stationary EEG application. Methods: We aimed to examine how the task-related synchronization pattern of action video game players (AVGPs) differs from non-AVGPs. EEG data were collected from thirty-five young and healthy male participants while performing an attention inhibition task and a visuospatial short-term memory-retention task. The sub-frequency components, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands of EEG were extracted using Discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The intra and inter-hemispheric coherence in EEG sub-frequency bands were assessed as a feature for the analysis. Results: Theta, alpha, beta and gamma coherence has shown a significant difference (p<0.05) between AVGPs and non-AVGPs in both the visuo-spatial tasks in intra and inter-hemispheric functionality. More than 90% classification accuracies arc achieved with ANFIS algorithm. Results also indicate that frontoparietal connectivity is significantly improved in AVGPs in both the visual sensory tasks considered. Conclusion: These EEG based analysis reports enhanced neural communication with improved attention inhibition and short-term memory retention in AVGPs. Result also established the Wavelet coherence as an effective tool in understanding the neural communication among different brain locations.	[Hazarika, Jupitara; Kant, P.

Researchers have developed digital authentication techniques which are implemented in society. One of these techniques is using biometric technology which is commonly known as face recognition, voice recognition, and fingerprinting. These techniques have achieved a high level of authentication but are subject to hacking or counterfeiting. In this paper, a new identification method based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is proposed. The EEG method uses a standard EEG database which deals with five different thought patterns or mental tasks which are multiplication, baseline, letter composition, rotation, and visual board counting. Using ANN (artificial neural network) classifier, EEG signals were classified. The performance of this proposed method is evaluated using five criteria: (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-Score measure, and false acceptance rate). The experimental results show that the EEG features extraction with wavelet 10 decomposition levels can achieve better than 5 decomposition levels for all mental tasks. The proposed method achieved the highest accuracy when using a visual counting mental task.

The generalization and robustness of an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based system are crucial requirements in actual practices. Approach. To reach these goals, we propose a new EEG representation that provides a more realistic view of brain functionality by applying multi-instance (MI) framework to consider the non-stationarity of the EEG signal. In this representation, the non-stationarity of EEG is considered by describing the signal as a bag of relevant and irrelevant concepts. The concepts are provided by a robust representation of homogeneous segments of EEG signal using spatial covariance matrices. Due to the nonlinear geometry of the space of covariance matrices, we determine the boundaries of the homogeneous segments based on adaptive segmentation of the signal in a Riemannian framework. Each subject is described as a bag of covariance matrices of homogeneous segments and the bag-level discriminative information is used for classification. Main results. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we examine it in a cultural neuroscience application for classification Iranian versus Swiss normal subjects to discover if strongly differing cultures can result in distinguishing patterns in brain electrical activity of the subjects. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed representation, we also evaluate the proposed representation in EEG-based mental disorder diagnosis application for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/bipolar mood disorder (BMD), Schizophrenia/ normal, and Major Depression Disorder/normal diagnosis applications. Significance. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach, which is gained due to the robustness of covariance descriptor, the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry, the benefits of considering the inherent non-stationary nature of the brain by applying bag-level discriminative information, and automatic handling the artifacts.

However, in the presence of high-dimensional data with irrelevant features, traditional sparse Bayesian classifiers suffer from performance degradation and low efficiency due to the incapability of eliminating irrelevant features. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel sparse Bayesian embedded feature selection algorithm that adopts truncated Gaussian distributions as both sample and feature priors. The proposed algorithm, called probabilistic feature selection and classification vector machine (PFCVMLP) is able to simultaneously select relevant features and samples for classification tasks. In order to derive the analytical solutions, Laplace approximation is applied to compute approximate posteriors and marginal likelihoods. Finally, parameters and hyperparameters are optimized by the type-II maximum likelihood method. Experiments on three datasets validate the performance of PFCVMLP along two dimensions: classification performance and effectiveness for feature selection. Finally, we analyze the generalization performance and derive a generalization error bound for PFCVMLP. By tightening the bound, the importance of feature selection is demonstrated.

Comparison of two methods of removing EOG artifacts for use in a motor imagery-based brain computer interface	EVOLVING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Blind source separation; Artifact removal; Independent component analysis; Brain computer interface; Classification	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; VECTOR ANALYSIS; FILTERS; ICA; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods are signal processing tools that are widely utilized for Electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis. The BSS separates a set of recorded EEG signals into a set of components. Note that the EEG measurements are often contaminated with various types of artifacts such as eye movements and blinks (Electrooculogram, EOG) that make data analysis very difficult. Therefore, we present a comparative study between two methods of removing EOG artifacts to be use in a Motor Imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (MI-BCI). In literature, a method of artifact removal based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using the concepts of Renyi's entropy and kurtosis has been presented that we call this method ICA (the first method). However, applying the ICA method to EEG signal directly can cause the significant distortion of the clean EEG signal because this method completely removes independent components capturing artifacts. In this study, we improve this method by applying Wavelet Denoising (WD) only to segments affected by artifacts from the detected artifactual components instead of the complete removal of these components. This method is called ICA-WD (the second method). The quality of removing the artifact is evaluated using the Relative Root-Mean-Squared Error and Average Correlation Coefficient criteria which are computed between the original and processed signals. The results show that the ICA-WD removes the EOG artifacts better than the ICA. Next, we apply the ICA-WD method to dataset 2a of BCI competition IV for the EOG artifact removal. Then, the cleaned EEG signals are employed for feature extraction and classification. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the three best competitors and another study performed on the BCI competition IV dataset 2a.	[Mohammadi, M.; Mosavi, M.

Diagnosis of Delusion and Hallucination from Schizophrenia Patient Using RADWT	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						ECG; RADWT; Hallucination; Schizophrenia		In this paper, early detection of schizophrenia types such as hallucination and delusion propose through the high Q-factor of RADWT in EEG signal acquired during the cognitive task of the patient. The earlier diagnose obtains from the energy distribution of the EEG signal in the high resolution via optimum tuning in dilation factor,which influences the Q-factor, redundancy and ringing in the EEG signal. The early detection of type of schizophrenia prevents the illness progression and lifelong disease. In existing clinical trial, the psych clinician diagnose only the schizophrenia disease through the standard DSM screening question and Prodromal signs checklist according to the standard of American Psychiatric Association. Furthermore, clinician tries to diagnose the disease through brain imaging and EEG signal. However, procedure in the diagnosis of Schizophrenia possible only in the acute stage, minimum after 2years of illness progression and still sub classification of the type of schizophrenia is a challenging task. In the proposed system, we acquire EEG signal during the three conditions such as reverse counting of the number, screening questions (DSM), and eye rest state with a distance of 1-m part of the clinician and patient to analyse cognitive behaviour. From the result of 25 patients EEG, signal during cognitive task show the different sub band energy pattern in RADWT to distinguish hallucination and delusion patient exactly for 21 patients and provide 84% of accuracy in sub-classification of type schizophrenia.

Methods: We collected information from 287 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy between 2009 and 2017 at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. Patients were prospectively followed up for at least 3 years. A number of features, including demographic features, medical history, and auxiliary examinations (electroencephalogram [EEG] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are selected to distinguish patients with different remission outcomes. Seizure outcomes classified as remission and never remission. In addition, remission is further divided into early remission and late remission. Five classical machine learning algorithms, i.e., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are selected and trained by our dataset to get classification models. Results: Our study shows that 1) compared with the other four algorithms, the XGBoost algorithm based machine learning model achieves the best prediction performance of the AED treatment outcomes between remission and never remission patients with an F1 score of 0.947 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.979: 2) The best discriminative factor for remission and never remission patients is higher number of seizures before treatment (>3); 3) XGBoost-based machine learning model also offers the best prediction between early remission and later remission patients, with an F1 score of 0.836 and an AUC value of 0.918; 4) multiple seizure type has the highest dependence to the categories of early and late remission patients. Significances: Our XGBoost-based machine learning classifier accurately predicts the most probable AED treatment outcome of a patient after he/she finishes all the standard examinations for the epilepsy disease. The classifier's prediction result could help disease guide counseling and eventually improve treatment strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Luo, J; Wang, J; Xu, R; Xu, KL				Luo, Jing; Wang, Jie; Xu, Rong; Xu, Kailiang			Class discrepancy-guided sub-band filter-based common spatial pattern for motor imagery classification	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Motor imagery; CSP; Sub-band filter	CSP	Background: Motor imagery classification, an important branch of brain-computer interface (BCI), recognizes the intention of subjects to control external auxiliary equipment. Therefore, EEG-based motor imagery classification has received increasing attention in the fields of neuroscience. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm has recently achieved great success in motor imagery classification. However, varying discriminative frequency bands and few-channel EEG limit the performance of CSP. New method: A class discrepancy-guided sub-band filter-based CSP (CDFCSP) algorithm is proposed to automatically recognize and augment the discriminative frequency bands for CSP algorithms. Specifically, a priori knowledge and templates obtained from the training set were applied as the design guidelines of the class discrepancy-guided sub-band filter (CDF). Second, a filter bank CSP was used to extract features from EEG traces filtered by the CDF. Finally, the CSP features of multiple frequency bands were leveraged to train linear support vector machine classifier and generate prediction. Results: BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b, which include EEGs from 18 subjects, were used to validate the performance improvement provided by the CDF. Student's t-tests of the CDFCSP versus the filter bank CSP without the CDF showed that the performance improvement was significant (i.e., p-values of 0.040 and 0.032 for the ratio and normalization mode CDFCSP, respectively). Comparison with existing method(s): The experiments show that the proposed CDFCSP improves the CSP algorithm and outperforms the other state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated in this paper. Conclusions: The increased performance of the proposed CDFCSP algorithm can promote the application of BCI systems.

Having, as a purpose, the development of a system for treating phobias that would automatically determine fear levels and adapt exposure intensity based on the user's current affective state, we propose a comparative study between various machine and deep learning techniques (four deep neural network models, a stochastic configuration network, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors), with and without feature selection, for recognizing and classifying fear levels based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral data from the DEAP (Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals) database. Fear was considered an emotion eliciting low valence, high arousal and low dominance. By dividing the ratings of valence/arousal/dominance emotion dimensions, we propose two paradigms for fear level estimationthe two-level (0no fear and 1fear) and the four-level (0no fear, 1low fear, 2medium fear, 3high fear) paradigms. Although all the methods provide good classification accuracies, the highest F scores have been obtained using the Random Forest Classifier89.96% and 85.33% for the two-level and four-level fear evaluation modality.

Compared with the general softmax layer, this hardware design adds threshold layers to accelerate the training speed and replace the Euler's base value with a dynamic base value to improve the network accuracy. This work also shows a hardware-friendly way to implement batch normalization layer on chip. Using the EEG emotion DEAP[7] database, the maximum and mean classification accuracy were achieved as 96.03% and 83.88% respectively.

A systematic review of English articles using the PubMed database since 2004 (last update 9/26/16). Search terms included text words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to neonatal seizures. Eligible articles included reports of neonates with seizures with a full description of seizure semiology and electroclinical findings. Independent extraction of data was performed by 2 authors using predefined data fields, including study quality indicators. Data were collected for every individual patient described in the articles. The dataset was analyzed with the Fisher exact test. The initial search led to 8507 titles; using filters, 2910 titles and abstracts were identified, with 177 full texts selected to be read. Fifty-seven studies were included in the analysis with 151 neonates (37.7 male and 62.9% term). Genetic etiologies (51%) and sequential seizures (41.1%) predominated in this sample and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) accounted for only 4%. The low prevalence of HIE observed was probably due to a publication bias. A significant association was found between etiology and seizure type: hemorrhage with autonomic seizures (P = 0.003), central nervous system (CNS) infection and stroke with clonic seizures (P = 0.042, P < 0.001, respectively), metabolic/vitamin-related disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism with myoclonic seizures (P < 0.001). There were also specific electroencephalography (EEG) patterns seen with certain etiologies: vascular disorders and electrolyte imbalance with focal ictal discharges (P < 0.001, P = 0.049 respectively), vitamin-related disorders with multifocal (P = 0.003), and all categories of genetic disorders with burst--suppression (P < 0.001). Clonic and autonomic seizures were more frequently present with focal EEG abnormalities (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001), whereas tonic and myoclonic seizures present with burst--suppression (P = 0.001, P = 0.005). In conclusion, our data suggest that specific associations of etiologies of neonatal seizures with distinct clinical features and EEG patterns might help in the decision to establish appropriate treatment.

Previous studies revealed that proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals contribute to error-monitoring processes, which are implemented in the posterior medial frontal cortex. Interestingly, errors also trigger changes in autonomic nervous system activity such as pupil dilation or heartbeat deceleration. Yet, the contribution of implicit interoceptive signals of bodily states to error-monitoring during ongoing performance has been overlooked. This study investigated whether cardiovascular interoceptive signals influence the neural correlates of error processing during performance, with an emphasis on the early stages of error processing. We recorded musicians' electroencephalography and electrocardiogram signals during the performance of highly-trained music pieces. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies revealed that pitch errors during skilled musical performance are preceded by an error detection signal, the pre-error-negativity (preERN), and followed by a later error positivity (PE). In this study, by combining ERP, source localization and multivariate pattern classification analysis, we found that the error-minus-correct ERP waveform had an enhanced amplitude within 40-100 ms following errors in the systolic period of the cardiac cycle. This component could be decoded from single-trials, was dissociated from the preERN and PE, and stemmed from the inferior parietal cortex, which is a region implicated in cardiac autonomic regulation. In addition, the phase of the cardiac cycle influenced behavioral alterations resulting from errors, with a smaller post-error slowing and less perturbed velocity in keystrokes following pitch errors in the systole relative to the diastole phase of the cardiac cycle. Lastly, changes in the heart rate anticipated the upcoming occurrence of errors. This study provides the first evidence of preconscious visceral information modulating neural and behavioral responses related to early error monitoring during skilled performance.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the neuro-physiological measurement of the brain's electrical activity recorded by electrodes placed in the cerebral cortex. The EEG signals play an essential role in the diagnosis of epilepsy. This paper proposes an approach for classifying the epileptic seizure patterns that carry significant indications regarding chronic neurological disorders. In this regard, a dimensionality reduction scheme, hybrid in nature, utilizing Independent and Principal Component Analysis (ICA and PCA) is developed followed by the extraction of statistical features for epileptic seizure identification. At first, a particular number of sub-frames is extracted from the given EEG signal. The extracted sub-frames are considered as the input of PCA and ICA. After that, the significant components of ICA and PCA are utilized for statistical feature extraction. Lastly, the supervised support vector machine (SVM) classifier is employed for the seizure classification purpose. To evaluate the raised method, the publicly available EPILEPTIC dataset is used. According to the experiments and result analysis, the proposed scheme achieves convincing performance in terms of accuracy when the first components of ICA and PCA algorithms are used for feature extraction.

Sleep EEG signal analysis based on correlation graph similarity coupled with an ensemble extreme machine learning algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Community detection; EEG signal; Sleep stages classification; Ensemble model; Correlation coefficient	COMPLEX NETWORKS APPROACH; STAGE CLASSIFICATION; K-MEANS; FEATURES; SYSTEM	Background: Sleep plays an essential role in repairing and healing human mental and physical health. Developing an efficient method for scoring electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stages is expected to help medical specialists in the early diagnosis of sleep disorders. Method: In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for classifying sleep stages EEG signals using correlation graphs. First, each 30 s EEG segment is divided into a set of sub-segments. The dimensionality of each sub-segment is reduced by using a statistical model. Second, each EEG segment is transferred into a graph considering each sub-segment as a node in a graph, and a link between each pair of nodes is calculated based on their correlation coefficient. Graph's modularity is used as input features into an ensemble classifier. Results: Different community detection algorithm based correlation graph are investigated to discern the most effective features to reveal the differences between EEG sleep stages. A combination of various classification techniques: a least square vector machine (LS-SVM), k-means, Naive Bayes, Fuzzy C-means, k-nearest, and logistic regression are tested using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to design an ensemble classifier. Based on the results of the MCDM, the best four: LS-SVM, Naive Bayes, logistic regression and k-nearest are integrated, to finally utilise as an ensemble classifier to categorise the graph's characteristics. The results obtained from the ensemble classifier are compared with those from the individual classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state of the art of sleep stages classification. The experimental results showed that the EEG sleep classification based on correlation graphs are able to achieve better recognition results than the existing state of the art techniques.

Previous studies have demonstrated human auditory cortex can reliably track the temporal envelope of speech in noisy environments, which provides a plausible neural basis for noise-robust speech recognition. The current study aimed at teasing apart auditory and language contributions to noise-robust envelope tracking by comparing the neural responses of 2 groups of listeners, i.e., native listeners and foreign listeners who did not understand the testing language. In the experiment, speech signals were mixed with spectrally matched stationary noise at 4 intensity levels and listeners' neural responses were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). When the noise intensity increased, the neural response gain increased in both groups of listeners, demonstrating auditory gain control. Language comprehension generally reduced the response gain and envelope-tracking precision, and modulated the spatial and temporal profile of envelope-tracking activity. Based on the spatio-temporal dynamics of envelope-tracking activity, a linear classifier can jointly decode the 2 listener groups and 4 levels of noise intensity. Altogether, the results showed that without feedback from language processing, auditory mechanisms such as gain control can lead to a noise-robust speech representation. High-level language processing modulated the spatio-temporal profile of the neural representation of speech envelope, instead of generally enhancing the envelope representation.

Dividing the samples into separate frequency bands, the power spectrum for each frequency band is calculated. All the parameters are taken for calculating each discrete wavelet transform. By amalgamation of the features like wavelet statistics, the frequency band power and total power, a complete feature vector of a single set is derived. The average of the CNN columns is then concatenated with the 4 level Discrete Wavelet Transform operated on the Pre-Processed EEG Signal with Power spectrum calculation value for each frequency band by using machine learning techniques.This creates the Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network which provides a 99.99% recognition rate.

Anyhow, it has been demonstrated that subjective measures suffer from poor resolution due to a high intra and inter-operator variability. Also, performance measures, if available, could provide just partial information, since an operator could achieve the same performance but experiencing a different workload. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate: (i) the higher resolution of neurophysiological measures in comparison to subjective ones; and (ii) how the simultaneous employment of neurophysiological measures and behavioral ones could allow a holistic assessment of operational tools. In this regard, we tested the effectiveness of an electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurophysiological index (W-EEG index) in comparing two different solutions (i.e., Normal and Augmented) in terms of experienced workload. In this regard, 16 professional air traffic controllers (ATCOs) have been asked to perform two operational scenarios. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) has also been recorded to evaluate the level of arousal (i.e., operator involvement) during the two scenarios execution. NASA-TLX questionnaire has been used to evaluate the perceived workload, and an expert was asked to assess performance achieved by the ATCOs. Finally, reaction times on specific operational events relevant for the assessment of the two solutions, have also been collected. Results highlighted that the Augmented solution induced a local increase in subjects performance (Reaction times). At the same time, this solution induced an increase in the workload experienced by the participants (W-EEG). Anyhow, this increase is still acceptable, since it did not negatively impact the performance and has to be intended only as a consequence of the higher engagement of the ATCOs. This behavioral effect is totally in line with physiological results obtained in terms of arousal (GSR), that increased during the scenario with augmentation. Subjective measures (NASA-TLX) did not highlight any significant variation in perceived workload. These results suggest that neurophysiological measure provide additional information than behavioral and subjective ones, even at a level of few seconds, and its employment during the pre-operational activities (e.g. , design process) could allow a more holistic and accurate evaluation of new solutions.

However, exceedingly increasing the channel need will increase the amount of calculation, and in some cases, decrease the accuracy and will also make the implementation of a BCI system difficult. Therefore, identifying the most effective channels in BCI systems is crucial because it will decrease the complexity and increase system accuracy. The Generalized Sequential forward selection (GSFS) method is used in this paper to choose the channel in a motor imagery BCI system for classification of right and left hand. Firstly, data is filtered to be in the frequency range of 4-30 lz because the results of previous research revealed that the highest effect of motor imagery is exerted inside this frequency range. The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) features and frequency domain features are simultaneously used in order to improve the system performance. Moreover, a PCVM classifier is used to enhance the classification performance. Employing the GSFS method and also simultaneously extracting the CSP and frequency domain features have increased the system output accuracy. The computation cost of this method is low compared to that of the genetic algorithm method for channel selection. The classification precision in the method used in this research is higher with respect to that of the SVM-RFE method which shows the advantage of this method over other methods for channel selection in an MI-BCI system.

Macroscopic brain dynamics is defined after successive coarse-grainings and selection of significant patterns and transitions based on Markov representation of brain activity.

J	Li, MY; Chen, WZ; Zhang, T				Li, Mingyang; Chen, Wanzhong; Zhang, Tao			FuzzyEn-based features in FrFT-WPT domain for epileptic seizure detection	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; FrFT; Fuzzy entropy; WPT	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; INVERSE GAUSSIAN PARAMETERS; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FOURIER-TRANSFORM; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS; RECOGNITION	In this paper, a hybrid method using fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn)-based features obtained from EEG signals in the FrFT-WPT domain is proposed for seizure detection. We have explored the ability of fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) in EEG processing and make an attempt to calculate FuzzyEn in the combined FrFT and wavelet packet decomposition (WPT) domain. In order to increase the discriminating ability of features, the FuzzyEn is extracted in FrFT-WPT domain when different fractional orders are set. And the principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to produce uncorrelated variables and also to reduce dimensionality. These feature vectors are passed through three classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification. In the experiment, we not only analyze the influence of different fractional orders but also compare the performance of various feature extractors. The current model has yielded superior performance for two 3-class classification problems, which are considered difficult, yet crucial, in clinical services. The experimental results also indicate that developed methodology is able to be a valuable diagnostic tool that can aid the doctors in providing better and timely care for the patients suffering from epilepsy.

In this paper, we investigated functional brain network alterations in a simulated flight experiment with three mental workload levels and compared the reorganization pattern between computer screen (2D) and virtual reality (3D) interfaces. We constructed multiband functional networks in electroencephalogram(EEG) source space, which were further assessed in terms of network efficiency and workload classification performances. We found that increased alpha band efficiencies and beta band local efficiency were associated with elevated mental workload levels, while beta band global efficiency exhibited distinct development trends between 2D and 3D interfaces. Furthermore, using a small subset of connectivity features, we achieved a satisfactory multi-level workload classification accuracy in both interfaces (82% for both 2D and 3D). Further inspection of these discriminative connectivity subsets, we found predominant alpha band connectivity features followed by beta and theta band features with different topological patterns between 2D and 3D interfaces. These findings allow for a more comprehensive interpretation of the neural mechanisms of mental workload in relation to real-world assessment.

A motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) provides an alternative way for people to interface with the outside world. However, the classification accuracy of MI signals remains challenging, especially with an increased number of classes and the presence of high variations with data from multiple individual people. This work investigates electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing techniques, aiming to enhance the classification performance of multiple MI tasks in terms of tackling the challenges caused by the vast variety of subjects. Approach. This work introduces a novel method to extract discriminative features by combining the features of functional brain networks with two other feature extraction algorithms: common spatial pattern (CSP) and local characteristicscale decomposition (LCD). After functional brain networks are established from the MI EEG signals of the subjects, the measures of degree in the binary networks are extracted as additional features and fused with features in the frequency and spatial domains extracted by the CSP and LCD algorithms. A real-time BCI robot control system is designed and implemented with the proposed method. Subjects can control the movement of the robot through four classes of MI tasks. Both the BCI competition IV dataset 2a and real-time data acquired in our designed system are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. Main results. As for the offline data experiment results, the average classification accuracy of the proposed method reaches 79.7%, outperforming the majority of popular algorithms. Experimental results with real-time data also prove the proposed method to be highly promising in its real-time performance. Significance. The experimental results show that our proposed method is robust in extracting discriminative brain activity features when performing different MI tasks, hence improving the classification accuracy in four-class MI tasks. The high classification accuracy and low computational demand show a considerable practicality for real-time rehabilitation systems.

Targeted Memory Reactivation during Sleep Elicits Neural Signals Related to Learning Content	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						episodic memory; memory consolidation; memory reactivation; multivariate pattern analysis; sleep	REPLAY; NREM; CONSOLIDATION; BRAIN	Retrieval of learning-related neural activity patterns is thought to drive memory stabilization. However, finding reliable, noninvasive, content-specific indicators of memory retrieval remains a central challenge. Here, we attempted to decode the content of retrieved memories in the EEG during sleep. During encoding, male and female human subjects learned to associate spatial locations of visual objects with left-or right-hand movements, and each object was accompanied by an inherently related sound. During subsequent slow-wave sleep within an afternoon nap, we presented half of the sound cues that were associated (during wake) with left-and right-hand movements before bringing subjects back for a final postnap test. We trained a classifier on sleep EEG data (focusing on lateralized EEG features that discriminated left-vs right-sided trials during wake) to predict learning content when we cued the memories during sleep. Discrimination performance was significantly above chance and predicted subsequent memory, supporting the idea that retrieval leads to memory stabilization. Moreover, these lateralized signals increased with postcue sleep spindle power, demonstrating that retrieval has a strong relationship with spindles. These results show that lateralized activity related to individual memories can be decoded from sleep EEG, providing an effective indicator of offline retrieval.

It could appear then a suitable task for modern artificial intelligence algorithms. Indeed, machine learning algorithms have been applied to sleep scoring for many years. As a result, several software products offer nowadays automated or semi-automated scoring services. However, the vast majority of the sleep physicians do not use them. Very recently, thanks to the increased computational power, deep learning has also been employed with promising results. Machine learning algorithms can undoubtedly reach a high accuracy in specific situations, but there are many difficulties in their introduction in the daily routine. In this review, the latest approaches that are applying deep learning for facilitating and accelerating sleep scoring are thoroughly analyzed and compared with the state of the art methods. Then the obstacles in introducing automated sleep scoring in the clinical practice are examined. Deep learning algorithm capabilities of learning from a highly heterogeneous dataset, in terms both of human data and of scorers, are very promising and should be further investigated.

In contrast to existing channel selection methods based on global CSP features, the proposed algorithm utilizes the Fisher ratio of time domain parameters (TDPs) and correlation coefficients: the channel with the highest Fisher ratio of TDPs, named principle channel, is selected and a supporting channel set for the principle channel that consists of highly correlated channels to the principle channel is generated. The proposed algorithm using the FBCSP features generated from the supporting channel set for the principle channel significantly improved the classification performance. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using BCI Competition III Dataset IVa (18 channels) and BCI Competition IV Dataset I (59 channels).

EEG-based seizure detection in patients with intellectual disability: Which EEG and clinical factors are important?	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Seizure detection; Intellectual disability; Imbalanced data; Post-processing; Multilevel analysis; LDA; SVM	NEONATAL SEIZURE; MENTAL-RETARDATION; AUTOMATIC ONLINE; EPILEPSY; CLASSIFICATION; PREVALENCE; MODELS; PREDICTION; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS	Epilepsy is a commonly secondary disability in people with an intellectual disability (ID), affecting 22% of the ID population while 1% of general population. Surprisingly, EEG-based automated seizure detection in the ID population has not yet been sufficiently studied. The reasons are twofold. Firstly, long-term EEG recordings are few due to behavioral problems. Secondly, the annotation of EEG recordings has been proved difficult due to the complex EEG signal abnormalities caused by brain development disorders. As a result, the performance of automated seizure detection for ID people is largely unknown. In this work, we performed automated seizure detection on a retrospective dataset containing 615 h ambulatory scalp EEG from 29 participants with ID, including 91 seizures. To design a generic seizure detector for the ID people, we need to deal with three major problems: highly imbalanced data, heterogeneous dataset and difficult annotation. (1) For the imbalanced data, we used proper performance criteria (e.g., precision and recall curve) and employed a post-processing process (i.e., patient-specific detection thresholds). (2) For the heterogeneous dataset, we employed multi-domain EEG features that showed a better discriminative power in our dataset, and compared the linear and nonlinear (LDA vs. SVM with Gaussian kernel) classifiers and validated using a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). (3) A stepwise EEG annotation procedure was used to improve the accuracy of annotation due to the presence of numerous seizure imitators and unclear contrast between ictal and interictal EEG activities. Results showed that LDA outperformed SVM with a clear margin of sensitivity, and achieved overall sensitivities 63.1-81.3%, a median FD/h of 1.0 and median latency of 11.5 s. Finally, we conclude that EEG signals of the ID population form a heterogeneous entity with respect to important factors: EEG discharge patterns, EEG backgrounds and EEG seizure visibility. The performance of the seizure detection varies significantly with these factors. The results presented here can serve as prior knowledge for designing a generic seizure detector for the ID patients and the non-convulsive seizure states (NCSS). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

C	Truong, ND; Zhou, LP; Kavehei, O			IEEE	Nhan Duy Truong; Zhou, Luping; Kavehei, Omid			Semi-supervised Seizure Prediction with Generative Adversarial Networks	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY			seizure prediction; adversarial networks; convolutional neural network; machine learning; iEEG; sEEG		Many outstanding studies have reported promising results in seizure prediction that is considered one of the most challenging predictive data analysis. This is mainly because electroencephalogram (EEG) bio-signal intensity is very small, in 1V range, and there are significant sensing difficulties given physiological and non-physiological artifacts. In this article, we propose an approach that can make use of not only labeled EEG signals but also the unlabeled ones which are more accessible. We also suggest the use of data fusion to further improve the seizure prediction accuracy. Data fusion in our vision includes EEG signals, cardiogram signals, body temperature and time. We use the short-time Fourier transform on 28-s EEG windows as a pre-processing step. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained in an unsupervised manner where information of seizure onset is disregarded. The trained Discriminator of the GAN is then used as feature extractor. Features generated by the feature extractor are classified by two fully-connected layers (can be replaced by any classifier) for the labeled EEG signals. This semi-supervised seizure prediction method achieves area under the operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 77.68% and 75.47% for the CHBMIT scalp EEG dataset and the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset, respectively. Unsupervised training without the need of labeling is important because not only it can be performed in real-time during EEG signal recording, but also it does not require feature engineering effort for each patient.

Analysis of these signals is important for epilepsy detection. However, analysis of these signals can be tricky in nature and requires human expertise. The human factor can result in subjective and possible erroneous epilepsy detection. To tackle this problem, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were introduced, to remove the human factor. However, this approach is counterintuitive in nature as it involves using complex features for epilepsy detection. Hence to tackle this problem we have introduced a wavelet based deep learning approach which eliminates the need of feature extraction and also performs significantly better on smaller datasets compared to the present state of the art ML algorithms. To test the robustness of our model we have performed a binary (2-way) and ternary (3-way) classification using our model. It is found that the model is much more accurate than the present state of the art models and since it uses deep learning it also eliminates the need of feature extraction.

The idle state detection is an important problem to construct a robust MI-BCI system since it needs to tell whether the subject is in MI task and the idle state contains much diverse cases. Herein, EEG-based multi-user BCI refers to two or more subjects engage in a coordinate task while their EEG are simultaneously recorded. The objective of this paper is to explore how the multi-user MI-BCI performance in idle detection based on CSP (common spatial pattern) and brain-network features. We proposed several strategies for cross-brain feature fusion. Results show that 1) Through CSP features, the classification accuracy of cross-brain outperforms the single brain CSP feature across different strategies. 2) Through brain-network features, the classification accuracy of concatenated with the paired subjects outperforms the single brain-network, while the inter-brain-network is lower than single subject 3) alpha frequency band shows better performance than other bands. Multi-user MI-BCI would be a potential way to improve the idle state detection accuracy.(1)	[Zhu, Li; Zhou, Changle] Xiamen Univ, Cognit Sci Dept, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Su, Chongwei; Zhang, Jianhai; Kong, Wanzeng] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Techonol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Cui, Gaochao] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan		Zhu, L; Zhou, CL (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Cognit Sci Dept, Xiamen, Peoples R China.; Zhang, JH; Kong, WZ (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Techonol, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.	zhulibrain@gmail.com; hdubci@163.com; cuigaochao@gmail.com; dozero@xmu.edu.cn; jhzhang@hdu.edu.cn; kongwanzeng@hdu.edu.cn			National Nature Science Foundation of China [61673322, 61633010, 61671193]; National Key R\&D Program of China for Intergovernmental International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Project [2017YFE0116800]; Key Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province [2018C04012]	National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R\&D Program of China for Intergovernmental International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Project; Key Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province	This work described in this paper was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No.61673322, No.61633010, No.61671193) and the National Key R\&D Program of China for Intergovernmental International Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Project (2017YFE0116800), Key Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province (2018C04012).		35	0	0	1	3	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA			978-1-7281-2297-7				2019							225	230		10.1109/CW.2019.00045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CW.2019.00045			6	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering	BP0MD					2022-08-02	WOS:000535356900036

The analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can lead to the detection of epileptic seizures. But due to immensely non-linear and non-stationary nature of EEG, it is very tedious to inspect and interpret these signals visually. Therefore, methods such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and non-linear features are used for automated detection of epilepsy from EEG signals. These methods represent discontinuities, repeated patterns and complexities in EEG signals much effectively and have very high discrimination ability to differentiate EEG segments into normal, interictal and ictal classes. In this work, we formed various feature sets using combination of DWT statistical features and non-linear features such as entropies and fractal dimension. These feature sets were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and various performance parameters were evaluated. One of the feature sets resulted in an overall accuracy of 99.7% and thereby the proposed technique emerged as an effective automatic seizure monitoring software.

It can be expressed via voice, facial expressions, body languages, mimics with intentionally or unintentionally to interact with the environment. In this regard, it is required to understand the emotion better to interpret the emotions. Emotion is generally used in many areas including rehabilitation applications, braincomputer interactions, genome-wide applications, healthcare services etc. There are many studies exist about emotion recognition with different approaches based on facial expression, voice and physiological signals. Yet, the first two of them can give incorrect information about emotions since these approaches can be manipulated by subjects easily. Thus, the more reliable and more durable approach proposed including EEG signals. Although it gives valuable information on emotion, EEG-based emotion estimation applications have not reached the desired level since its abstract and pattern recognition methods (falsified feature extraction methods, false classifier algorithms, big data, etc.) used for that applications. EEG-based emotion estimation is a complicated assignment which requires deep features, many EEG channels, clear signals and classifier algorithms. Determining the features and analyzing them requires time, thus in this study, we applied deep learning to discriminate the positive/negative emotional states. Our proposed method includes three parts; i) Collecting EEG data ii) Preprocessed the EEG data to denoise the signal iii) Deep learning with AlexNet and VGG-16 We collected EEG signals from 28 various subjects aged between 21-28 via portable and wearable EEG device called Emotiv Epoc+ 14 channel. In order to collect the signals, we applied four different video games as stimuli (2 negative and 2 positive labelled games) and collected signals totally 20 minutes long for each subject. At the end of the EEG collection process, we obtained 1568 number of EEG samples (14x28x4). To collect more reliable and healthy information from signals we preprocessed our signals. Finally, we performed two different deep learning algorithms to determine the positive-negative emotions and to compare their results. It is observed that the classification accuracies differ with different algorithms and the classification performance was found 92,09% with VGG16 which is superior to AlexNet algorithm 87,76%.

Given the aging society, it is important to understand the neural mechanisms constraining perception in the elderly. In young participants, the state of rhythmic brain activity prior to a stimulus has been shown to modulate the neural encoding and perceptual impact of this stimulus - yet it remains unclear whether, and if so, how, the perceptual relevance of pre-stimulus activity changes with age. Using the auditory system as a model, we recorded EEG activity during a frequency discrimination task from younger and older human listeners. By combining single-trial EEG decoding with linear modelling we demonstrate consistent statistical relations between pre-stimulus power and the encoding of sensory evidence in short-latency EEG components, and more variable relations between pre-stimulus phase and subjects' decisions in longer-latency components. At the same time, we observed a significant slowing of auditory evoked responses and a flattening of the overall EEG frequency spectrum in the older listeners. Our results point to mechanistically consistent relations between rhythmic brain activity and sensory encoding that emerge despite changes in neural response latencies and the relative amplitude of rhythmic brain activity with age.

Several studies indicated that EEG is a robust biometric that can greatly improve identification rates. Biometric methods depending on multiple tasks are favorable than those based on a single task. Multi-tasks approaches can enhance personal recognition rates and also reduce the possibility of falsifying biometric data. Furthermore, biometric systems relying on cognitive tasks are harder to be reproduced. Therefore, this paper proposes a new EEG- biometric system based on multiple cognitive tasks. The method examines the electrodes placements on different sites on the scalp and selects a group of sites that influence the accuracy of the system. The results show that the proposed biometric system is capable of accurately recognizing persons. Also, the electrodes placed on frontal, temporal, and parietal sites are adequate to correctly identify persons with an identification accuracy of 100%. It has a challenging performance compared to the state of the art techniques. Thus, the proposed technique is robust and can be adopted in areas which require high security and confidentiality.

Current brain-computer interface (BCI) studies demonstrate the potential to decode neural signals obtained from structured and trial-based tasks to drive actuators with high performance within the context of these tasks. Ideally, to maximize utility, such systems will be applied to a wide range of behavioral settings or contexts. Thus, we explore the potential to augment such systems with the ability to decode abstract behavioral contextual states from neural activity. Approach. To demonstrate the feasibility of such context decoding, we used electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) data recorded from the cortical surface and deeper brain structures, respectively, continuously across multiple days from three subjects. During this time, the subjects were engaged in a range of naturalistic behaviors in a hospital environment. Behavioral contexts were labeled manually from video and audio recordings; four states were considered: engaging in dialogue, rest, using electronics, and watching television. We decode these behaviors using a factor analysis and support vector machine (SVM) approach. Main results. We demonstrate that these general behaviors can be decoded with high accuracies of 73% for a four-class classifier for one subject and 71% and 62% for a three-class classifier for two subjects. Significance. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the potential to disambiguate abstract naturalistic behavioral contexts from neural activity recorded throughout the day from implanted electrodes. This work motivates further study of context decoding for BCI applications using continuously recorded naturalistic activity in the clinical setting.

The effective use of these signals, especially in disease detection, is very important in terms of both time and cost. Currently, in general, EEG studies are used in addition to conventional methods as well as deep learning networks that have recently achieved great success. The most important reason for this is that in conventional methods, increasing classification accuracy is based on too many human efforts as EEG is being processed, obtaining the features is the most important step. This stage is based on both the time-consuming and the investigation of many feature methods. Therefore, there is a need for methods that do not require human effort in this area and can learn the features themselves. Based on that, two-dimensional (2D) frequency-time scalograms were obtained in this study by applying Continuous Wavelet Transform to EEG records containing five different classes. Convolutional Neural Network structure was used to learn the properties of these scalogram images and the classification performance of the structure was compared with the studies in the literature. In order to compare the performance of the proposed method, the data set of the University of Bonn was used. The data set consists of five EEG records containing healthy and epilepsy disease which are labeled as A, B, C, D, and E. In the study, A-E and B-E data sets were classified as 99.50%, A-D and B-D data sets were classified as 100% in binary classifications, A-D-E data sets were 99.00% in triple classification, A-C-D-E data sets were 90.50%, B-C-D-E data sets were 91.50% in quaternary classification, and A-B-C-D-E data sets were in the fifth class classification with an accuracy of 93.60%.

J	Zeng, M; Zhao, CY; Meng, QH				Zeng, Ming; Zhao, Chun-Yu; Meng, Qing-Hao			Detecting Seizures From EEG Signals Using the Entropy of Visibility Heights of Hierarchical Neighbors	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Epilepsy; electroencephalogram (EEG); entropy; visibility height; hierarchical neighbors	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; EPILEPTIC SEIZURE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; BINARY PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION; GRAPH; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that causes unprovoked, recurrent sudden abnormal reactions of the brain. Characterizing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of the patient is an effective way for the early prediction of epileptic seizures. In this paper, a new method called the entropy of visibility heights of hierarchical neighbors (EVHHN) is proposed to detect seizures from the EEG signals. First, the visibility relationships of three nearest neighbors are determined by a visibility criterion. Then, we compute the visibility heights of three nearest neighbors for each data point. Next, the four different kinds of entropy associated with neighbor visibility states are calculated to characterize the EEG signals and finally these features are validated by LS-SVM classifiers. In the experiment, the normal and ictal EEG signals are classified with the accuracy of 99.6%, meanwhile, the interictal and ictal EEG signals are distinguished with the accuracy of 98.35%, which proves the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, the computational time of extracting features for each set is 1.751 s, which is largely reduced compared with other weighted visibility graph-based methods. In conclusion, the EVHHN can potentially be an effective method for characterizing complicated EEG signals and real-time detection of epileptic seizures.

To date, unsupervised methods to accurately detect iEEG artifacts are not available. This study introduces a novel machine-learning approach for detection of artifacts in iEEG signals in clinically controlled conditions using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and benchmarks the method's performance against expert annotations. The method was trained and tested on data obtained from St Anne's University Hospital (Brno, Czech Republic) and validated on data from Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, U.S.A). We show that the proposed technique can be used as a generalized model for iEEG artifact detection. Moreover, a transfer learning process might be used for retraining of the generalized version to form a data-specific model. The generalized model can be efficiently retrained for use with different EEG acquisition systems and noise environments. The generalized and specialized model F1 scores on the testing dataset were 0.81 and 0.96, respectively. The CNN model provides faster, more objective, and more reproducible iEEG artifact detection compared to manual approaches.

However CSP has some shortcomings, particularly, it is sensitivity to noise and outlier data which results in lower classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a regularized version of the original CSP (Corr-CSP), in which the objective function is penalized by a properly designed penalty term which encourages decorrelation between the data from two classes in such a way that the resulting objective function has still straightforward solution through Eigen value decomposition. Furthermore, we have used three different datasets from the BCI Competition BCI database in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and compare it to the original CSP. The simulation results show on the average 4% of improvement in terms of classification accuracy for the proposed Corr-CSP approach.

To solve this problem, the development of a model based on decision trees and supervised neural networks is proposed; it is focusing on the four main risk factors of traffic accidents: a) drive inattentive to traffic conditions, b) not respecting the regulatory traffic signals, c) driving in a state of drowsiness or poor physical condition, d) drive vehicle over the Maximum Speed Limits. The Machine Learning system requires three models: a) neural network for object recognition; b) algorithm for sleepiness detection; and, c) decision tree to issue factor-related alerts: driver status (sleepiness or distraction), speed and traffic signal alert. Finally, the model is put into production in a low cost ADAS mobile application, and it was tested in the laboratory using recordings obtained in real driving tests (n = 200, success>=90%) in ideal luminosity environments.

Since EEG activities during sleep exhibit physiological and pathological situation of the brain, analyzing the oscillations during various sleep stages are of fundamental importance for the assessment of sleep disorders. On the other hand, recent developments in the fields of signal processing and pattern recognition have prompted sleep researchers to employ accurate and reliable computerized systems in diagnosis processes. The purpose of this paper was to develop a novel automated methodology for diagnosing apneic patients from healthy subjects using single channel EEG signal. To this end, it was concentrated on the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. A comprehensive time-domain based feature extraction scheme was proposed for extracting features from various EEG frequency bands of REM sleep. Uninformative features were eliminated by minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithm. An ensemble learning method namely random undersampling boosting (RUSBoost) was then utilized for the purpose of classitication. The effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach were evaluated using k-fold cross-validation technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can be used as an efficient method for automated SAS screening with regard to promising classification performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

Evaluating the effect of the cutoff frequencies during the pre-processing stage of motor imagery EEG signals classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG signals classification; Fractal dimension; Pre-processing; Brain-computer interfaces	FRACTAL DIMENSION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; NEUROFEEDBACK; SELECTION	Brain signals classification is an interesting topic due its different applications not only in the medical field, but also in the development of technology. Due to the features of the brain signals such as high variability and complexity, the stages previous to the classification: pre-processing and feature extraction, are crucial. Particularly, the pre-processing stage has different objectives such as segmentation, artifact removal or the selection of desired frequency bands. The latter is useful since different oscillatory patterns are present when different mental tasks are performed. Therefore, in this work, we propose an analysis of the accuracy during the classification when electroencephalographic (EEG) signals related to motor imagery tasks, are filtered by a band pass filter with different cutoff frequencies. The results are compared against those achieved when the signals are filtered using the frequency bands related to the performed tasks, in this case: alpha and beta bands. Furthermore, different feature extraction techniques are evaluated: the coefficients of an auto-regressive model and the fractal dimension computed through two different methods, Higuchi and Katz. The classification is achieved by a linear discriminant. Based on a statistical analysis is possible to say that a significant increase on the accuracy is achieved when the cutoff frequencies of the band pass filter are properly selected. Moreover, the results suggest that the fractal dimension provides better results than AR coefficients and for computing the fractal dimension, Higuchi's method is better option than Katz since provides similar accuracy values but its computational complexity is lower.

J	Riley, EA; Owora, A; McCleary, J; Anderson, A				Riley, Ellyn A.; Owora, Arthur; McCleary, Joshua; Anderson, Alyssa			Sleepiness, Exertion Fatigue, Arousal, and Vigilant Attention in Persons With Chronic Aphasia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY			English	Article							POSTSTROKE FATIGUE; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; AUDITORY VIGILANCE; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; SEVERITY SCALE; STROKE; EEG; INDIVIDUALS; LANGUAGE; VALIDATION	Purpose: Individuals in the acute and chronic stages of stroke recovery often report more daytime sleepiness (Sterr, Herron, Dijk, & Ellis, 2008) and fatigue that qualitatively differs from "normal" feelings of fatigue they experienced prestroke (De Doncker, Dantzer, Ormstad, & Kuppuswamy, 2018). Speech-language pathologists frequently observe signs of fatigue in their clients with aphasia and perceive that client fatigue impedes therapeutic interventions (Riley, 2017). The current study aimed to quantify daytime sleepiness, exertion fatigue, and physiologically measured arousal and vigilant attention in persons with aphasia. Method: We measured sleepiness, exertion fatigue, arousal, and vigilant attention in 10 participants with aphasia and 10 neurologically healthy adults. Daytime sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Johns, 1991). Exertion fatigue was measured using the Visual Analog Fatigue Scale (B. Y. Tseng, Gajewski, & Kluding, 2010) before and after a 72-min computer-administered language task. Arousal was measured using heart rate and variability (Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017). Vigilant attention was measured using electroencephalography and subsequently classified into 1 of 4 levels of vigilant attention using a classification algorithm (Berka et al., 2004). Results: Persons with aphasia did not show significant differences from controls in reported amount of daytime sleepiness, exertion fatigue, or overall physiological arousal but demonstrated different patterns of electroencephalography-measured vigilant attention and error production as compared to controls. Conclusions: Although overall sleepiness, exertion fatigue, and overall arousal did not differ between groups, physiological measures of vigilant attention may be more sensitive to differences and may explain feelings of fatigue that persons with chronic aphasia experience.

The proposed algorithm initially learns from a small pool of labeled data, and then uses a confidence criterion to sequentially select the most informative samples from the arriving subset to increasingly improve the classifier. Specially, a novel segmented common spatial pattern (SCSP) method is involved to the BMSUST-SCSP algorithm for extracting more reliable features than common spatial pattern (CSP). The proposed BMSUST-SCSP algorithm achieves better classification performance than static classification based on SCSP and batch-mode sequential updating self-training with common spatial pattern (BMSUST-CSP) algorithm with the help of small labeled data and large unlabeled data. As an incremental algorithm, with the arriving of one unlabeled subset, the increasing number of iterations in self-training can improve the performance of the classifier. The Dataset IVa of BCI Competition III has been used to demonstrate the validity of our method.

In this work we study the possibility of detecting the visual imagination of seven different geometric objects (triangle, circle, square, pentagon, line, hexagon and parallelogram). The power spectral density in the alpha band were compared offline with using common spatial pattern (CSP) and the variance of each channel, obtaining as a best result the calculation of the CSP plus variance in the alpha band and classifying the vector of features with a support vector machine (SVM), obtaining an average result of 52% accuracy and a kappa value of 0.43 in the classification of the seven geometrical shapes, reaching up to 83% and a kappa value of 0.78 for a single user.

This is probably because it is more difficult to detect the brain activities of lower limb MI. In order to reliably detect the brain activities of lower limbs to restore or improve the walking ability of the disabled, we propose a new paradigm of walking imagery (WI) in a virtual environment (VE), in order to elicit the reliable brain activities and achieve a significant training effect. First, we extract and fuse both the spatial and time-frequency features as a multi-view feature to represent the patterns in the brain activity. Second, we design a multi-view multi-level deep polynomial network (MMDPN) to explore the complementarity among the features so as to improve the detection of walking from an idle state. Our extensive experimental results show that the VE-based paradigm significantly performs better than the traditional text-based paradigm. In addition, the VE-based paradigm can effectively help users to modulate the brain activities and improve the quality of electroencephalography signals. We also observe that the MMDPN outperforms other deep learning methods in terms of classification performance.

Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to explore the outcome of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) in suspicious areas guided by magnetoencephalography (MEG)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction in MRI-negative epilepsy patients. Methods: This study included 47 patients with negative-MRI epilepsy. Seizure outcome at 24 months was assessed using a modified Engel's classification. Accordingly, class I and II were considered favorable outcomes, whereas classes III and IV were unfavorable. Furthermore, patients were classified into a consistent group if the results of MEG and SEEG indicated the same area of the brain. The relationship between surgical outcome and the concordance of MEG and SEEG was analyzed. Results: A complete seizure-free condition was achieved in 22 (47%) patients. Sex, handedness, age and duration of illness were not significantly associated with seizure-free outcome (p = .187 [Pearson chi-squared test]). The number of patients with favorable outcome (Engle I and II) was as high as 68% at the time of follow-up. Furthermore, more seizure-free patients were found in the SEEG and MEG consistent group. Conclusions: SEEG is a valuable tool in the pre-evaluation for resective epilepsy surgery, particularly in negative-MRI epilepsy patients; MEG greatly facilitates localization for SEEG electrode implantation. However, none of these tools are absolutely sensitive and reliable; therefore, collecting as much information as possible is necessary to achieve satisfactory results in epilepsy surgery.

Sarma			Developing brain abnormality recognize system using multi-objective pattern producing neural network	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain abnormal; Electroencephalogram (EEG); ISO map spectral feature; Multi-objective pattern producing neural network	EEG; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	According to the survey, brain abnormal mortality rate is increased up to 86% due to the severe effect of brain injuries, brain tumor, brain stork and other genetic mutations. The brain abnormality may occur in different disease such as Glioblastoma, Ependymoma/anaplastic ependymoma, bipolar disorder and so on. Due to the dangerous brain disease, it has to be detected in earlier stage for avoiding the mortality rate. So, in this paper introduce the multi-objective pattern producing neural network for developing the automatic brain abnormality recognizes system. Initially the brain signal such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) is collected from patient, noise present in the signal is removed using frequency normalization principal component analysis approach. The noise free signal is further examined, different features are extracted by applying ISO map spectral feature and particle bee based features are selected. The selected features are fed into the above-mentioned classifier that recognizes the brain abnormality related features according to the effective activation function. Then the efficiency of the brain abnormality recognize system is implemented in MATLAB tool and the excellence of the system is evaluated in terms of using error rate, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, Mathew correlation coefficient and accuracy.

Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system is one of very important research hotspots in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Because of its wide success in many fields, TSK fuzzy system has attracted more and more researchers' attention. How to further improve its classification performance is still a challenging task for machine learning. Based on the negative correlation learning theory, a multi-layer TSK fuzzy system with fast aggregation training (ML-TSK-FA) is proposed. The classifier ML-TSK-FA is also similar to deep learning hierarchy. The hidden layer in each base training block of ML-TSK-FA is represented by interpretable fuzzy rules. Based on the cascade structure theory, the source data is mapped into each independent base training block as the same input space. Unlike traditional constructions, this study proposes a screening mechanism for selecting TSK fuzzy classifiers with better classification performance in a training block, while discarding those with poor performance. The advantage of this method is that it greatly saves the training cost and improves the approximation performance of the training model. Experiments show that the proposed classifier ML-TSK-FA is very suitable for EEG signal classification. This also indirectly indicates that ML-TSK-FA is a promising classification system.

Successful problem-solving behavioral pattern choice determines organizational and personal success, therefore a proper understanding of the problem-solving-related neurological dynamics is sure to help increase business performance. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, to discover relevant neurological characteristics of problem-solving behavioral patterns, and second, to conduct a characterization of two problem-solving behavioral patterns with the aid of deep-learning architectures. This is done by combining electroencephalographic non-invasive sensors that capture process owners' brain activity signals and a deep-learning soft sensor that performs an accurate characterization of such signals with an accuracy rate of over 99% in the presented case-study dataset. As a result, the deep-learning characterization of lean management (LM) problem-solving behavioral patterns is expected to help Industry 4.0 leaders in their choice of adequate manufacturing systems and their related problem-solving methods in their future pursuit of strategic organizational goals.

One in 14 people will experience anxiety disorder at the given year. When associated with mood disorders, anxiety can also trigger or increase other diseases' symptoms and effects, like depression and suicidal behavior. Binaural beats are a low-frequency type of acoustic stimulation perceived when the individual is subjected to two slightly different wave frequencies, from 200 to 900 Hz. Binaural beats can contribute to anxiety reduction and modification of other psychological conditions and states, modifying cognitive processes and mood states. In this work, we applied a 5 Hz binaural beat to 6 different subjects, to detect a relevant change in their brainwaves before and after the stimuli. We applied 20 min stimuli in 10 separated sessions. We assessed the differences using a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier in comparison with non-parametric tests and Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA). eLORETA showed remarkable changes in High Alpha. Both eLORETA and MLP approaches revealed outstanding modifications in high Beta. MLP evinced significant changes in Theta brainwaves. Our study evidenced high Alpha modulation at the limbic lobe, implicating in a possible reduction of sympathetic system activation in the studied sample. Our main results on eLORETA suggest a strong increase in the current distribution, mostly in Alpha 2, at the Anterior Cingulate, which is related to the monitoring of mistakes regarding social conduct, recognition and expression of emotions. We also found that MLPs are able of evincing the main differences with high separability in Delta and Theta. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One of the most commonly utilized phenomena in BCI are steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) that are measured with electroencephalography (EEG). If the subject focuses his/her attention on the stimulus flashing with specified frequency on the computer screen, a signal fluctuations with the same frequency may be observed in his or her visual cortex. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) was adapted to EEG signal analysis and the outcomes of this straightforward approach are more promising in terms of obtaining decoding accuracy than conventional methods. In CCA two sets of data are being compared: a multichannel signal, and a reference prior corresponding to the classes between which the distinction is being made. Category of the signal (e.g., 8 Hz vs 14 Hz) is determined on the basis of the correlation coefficient between the acquired signal and several reference signals. The aim of this paper is to present an idea of utilizing genetic algorithms to generate these reference priors. Outcomes of our analyses suggest that a genetic approach (with signal encoding in the form of the binary code) and tournament selection method may improve the accuracy of SSVEP classification. Further work may help to improve the accuracy even more, with different encoding scheme or alternative and/or more sophisticated selection approach.

Here, we propose a hardware-efficient machine learning algorithm based on gradient boosted decision trees. Specifically, we train our model to minimize the energy cost associated with feature extraction, and reduce the model size by employing a fixed point quantization method. Hardware parameters such as filter order and coefficient resolution are further optimized for seizure detection task to achieve a reasonable trade-off between performance and hardware cost. Testing this model on the intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from 10 patients with epilepsy, we are able to reduce the energy cost by 68.4% compared to the base model, and quantize the tree parameters with 3b (for leaf weights) and 10b (for thresholds), while maintaining the classification performance.

For P300 signal classification, feature extraction is an important step. In this work, deep feature learning techniques based on sparse autoencoder (SAE) and stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) are proposed for feature extraction. Deep feature provides the abstract information about the signal. This work proposes fusion of deep features with the temporal features, which provides abstract and temporal information about the EEG signal. These deep feature and temporal feature are partially complement of each other to represent the EEG signal. For classification of the EEG signal, an ensemble of support vector machines (ESVM) is adopted as it helps to reduce the classifiers variability. In classifier ensemble system, the score of individual classifier is not at the same level. To transform these scores into a common level, min-max normalization is proposed prior to combining them. Min-max normalization scales the classifiers' score between 0 and 1. The experiments are conducted on three standard public datasets, dataset IIb of BCI Competition II, dataset II of the BCI Competition III and BNCI Horizon dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields better or comparable performance compared to earlier reported techniques.

One of the most common problems in artifact elimination or brain activity related studies is the ordering and identification of the independent components (ICs). In this work, a novel procedure is proposed which combines ICA decomposition at trial level with an unsupervised learning algorithm (K-means) at participant level in order to enhance the related signal patterns which might represent interesting brain waves. The feasibility of this methodology is evaluated with EEG data acquired with participants performing on the Halstead Category Test. The analysis shows that it is possible to find the Feedback Error Negativity (FRN) Potential at single-trial level and relate its characteristics with the performance of the participant based on their knowledge of the abstract principle underlying the task.

Most existing classifiers aim to capture these structures by regularizing the regression matrix or introducing factorization technique. In this paper, we propose a multi-distance support matrix machine (MDSMM), which formulates the optimization problem by introducing the concept of multi-distance. Unlike traditional matrix-based classifiers, the proposed approach uses a vector-based distance to quantify the cost function and penalty function. We further study the generalization bounds for i.i.d. processes and non i.i.d. processes based on different classifiers. For typical hypothesis classes where matrix norms are constrained, MDSMM achieves a faster learning rate than conventional methods. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach by conducting comparative experiments on both simulation study and a number of real-world datasets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the brain activity (i.e., P300 amplitude) during tasks cannot alwaysprovide satisfying discrimination of patients with schizophrenia (SZs) from healthy controls (HCs). Spontaneous activity at rest indices the potential of the brain, such that if the task information can be efficiently processed, it provides a compensatory understanding of the cognitive deficits in SZs. In this paper, based on the resting and P300 task electroencephalogram (EEG) data sets, we constructed functional EEG networks and then extracted the inherent spatial pattern of network (SPN) features for both brain states. Finally, the combined SPN features of the rest and task networks were used to recognize SZs. The findings of this paper revealed that the combined SPN features could achieve the highest accuracy of 90.48%, with the sensitivity of 89.47%, and specificity of 91.30%. These findings consistently implied that the rest and task P300 EEGs could actually provide comprehensive information to reliably classify SZs from HCs, and the SPN is a promising tool for the clinical diagnosis of SZs.

This classification task usually encounters difficulties such as data with poor signal-to-noise ratio, contamination from muscle activity, body movements, and external interferences, and both intra-subject and intersubject variability. Through the spatiotemporal features automatically learned from training data, deep neural networks continue to demonstrate their good performance, versatility, and adaptation capability. In this work, we developed a novel neural network model which can extract signal features from multiple electrodes in a manner similar to that of conventional signal processing methods, such as common spatial patterns and common temporal patterns. The proposed neural network model comprises an attention mechanism, which calculates the importance of each electrode, and a spatial convolution layer. Compared to the results obtained using a variety of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the proposed scheme represents a considerable advancement in classification accuracy when applied to the BCI competition IV dataset 2a. By training with data of all subjects, the proposed universal neural network model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.

The interface combines electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain signals and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deliver information noninvasively to the brain. The interface allows three human subjects to collaborate and solve a task using direct brain-to-brain communication. Two of the three subjects are designated as "Senders" whose brain signals are decoded using real-time EEG data analysis. The decoding process extracts each Sender's decision about whether to rotate a block in a Tetris-like game before it is dropped to fill a line. The Senders' decisions are transmitted via the Internet to the brain of a third subject, the "Receiver," who cannot see the game screen. The Senders' decisions are delivered to the Receiver's brain via magnetic stimulation of the occipital cortex. The Receiver integrates the information received from the two Senders and uses an EEG interface to make a decision about either turning the block or keeping it in the same orientation. A second round of the game provides an additional chance for the Senders to evaluate the Receiver's decision and send feedback to the Receiver's brain, and for the Receiver to rectify a possible incorrect decision made in the first round. We evaluated the performance of BrainNet in terms of (1) Group-level performance during the game, (2) True/False positive rates of subjects' decisions, and (3) Mutual information between subjects. Five groups, each with three human subjects, successfully used BrainNet to perform the collaborative task, with an average accuracy of 81.25%. Furthermore, by varying the information reliability of the Senders by artificially injecting noise into one Sender's signal, we investigated how the Receiver learns to integrate noisy signals in order to make a correct decision. We found that like conventional social networks, BrainNet allows Receivers to learn to trust the Sender who is more reliable, in this case, based solely on the information transmitted directly to their brains. Our results point the way to future brain-to-brain interfaces that enable cooperative problem solving by humans using a "social network" of connected brains.	[Jiang, Linxing; Rao, Rajesh P.

In this PhD project, I will implement user interfaces which adapt to the cognitive state of the user, for example by avoiding distractions or re-directing the user's attention towards missed information. For this purpose, sensory data from the user is captured (Brain activity via EEG of fNIRS, eye tracking, physiological measurements) and modeled with machine learning techniques. The focus of the cognitive state estimation is centered around attention related aspects. The main task is to build models for an estimation of a person's attentional state from the combination and classification of multimodal data streams and context information, as well as their evaluation. Furthermore, the goal is to develop prototypical user interfaces for AR glasses and to test their usability in different scenarios.

Approach: Initially, a number of recorded EEG channels were selected using a new proposed EEG channel selection method. The signals were recorded from 10 healthy subjects in two states of movement imagination and implementation. Then, a NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous) neural network estimated the motion pattern of knee angle using the selected channels of EEG data. Main results: The results indicated that movement information extracted from the selected channels in mu rhythm was more accurate. Significance: This research suggests an approach to design the desired motion trajectory of the knee joint using the information emerging from the motor control process.

Cortical sensitivity to natural scene structure	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; multivariate decoding; scene representation; spatial structure; visual perception	TIME-COURSE; OBJECT; REPRESENTATIONS; CONTEXT; CORTEX; BODIES; LAYOUT	Natural scenes are inherently structured, with meaningful objects appearing in predictable locations. Human vision is tuned to this structure: When scene structure is purposefully jumbled, perception is strongly impaired. Here, we tested how such perceptual effects are reflected in neural sensitivity to scene structure. During separate fMRI and EEG experiments, participants passively viewed scenes whose spatial structure (i.e., the position of scene parts) and categorical structure (i.e., the content of scene parts) could be intact or jumbled. Using multivariate decoding, we show that spatial (but not categorical) scene structure profoundly impacts on cortical processing: Scene-selective responses in occipital and parahippocampal cortices (fMRI) and after 255 ms (EEG) accurately differentiated between spatially intact and jumbled scenes. Importantly, this differentiation was more pronounced for upright than for inverted scenes, indicating genuine sensitivity to spatial structure rather than sensitivity to low-level attributes. Our findings suggest that visual scene analysis is tightly linked to the spatial structure of our natural environments. This link between cortical processing and scene structure may be crucial for rapidly parsing naturalistic visual inputs.

However, sleep scoring is a time-consuming tedious labor. Very few studies discuss the 5-stage (wake/NREM1/NREM2/transition sleep/REM) automatic fine analysis of wake-sleep stages in rodent models. The present study aimed to develop and validate an automatic rule-based classification of 5-stage wake-sleep pattern in acid-induced widespread hyperalgesia model of the rat. Results The overall agreement between two experts' consensus and automatic scoring in the 5-stage and 3-stage analyses were 92.32% (kappa = 0.88) and 94.97% (kappa = 0.91), respectively. Standard deviation of the accuracy among all rats was only 2.93%. Both frontal-occipital EEG and parietal EEG data showed comparable accuracies. The results demonstrated the performance of the proposed method with high accuracy and reliability. Subtle changes exhibited in the 5-stage wake-sleep analysis but not in the 3-stage analysis during hyperalgesia development of the acid-induced pain model. Compared with existing methods, our method can automatically classify vigilance states into 5-stage or 3-stage wake-sleep pattern with a promising high agreement with sleep experts. Conclusions In this study, we have performed and validated a reliable automated sleep scoring system in rats. The classification algorithm is less computation power, a high robustness, and consistency of results. The algorithm can be implanted into a versatile wireless portable monitoring system for real-time analysis in the future.

Methods: We recorded EEG data for a group of PD patients with MCI (n = 27) and PD patients without cognitive impairment (n = 43) using a high-resolution recording system. The EEG files were processed and 66 frequency along with 330 connectivity (phase lag index, PLI) measures were calculated. These measures were used to classify MCI vs. MCI-free patients. We also assessed correlations of these features with cognitive tests based on comprehensive scores (domains). Results: PLI measures classified PD-MCI from non-MCI patients better than frequency measures. PLI in delta, theta band had highest importance for identifying patients with MCI. Amongst cognitive domains, we identified the most significant correlations between Memory and Theta PLI, Attention and Beta PLI. Conclusion: PLI is an effective quantitative EEG measure to identify PD patients with MCI. Significance: We identified quantitative EEG measures which are important for early identification of cognitive decline in PD. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

The algorithm uses only signals from the frontal and the front-temporal lobes EEG electrodes while yielding a seizure detection performance competitive to the standard full EEG systems. The experimental validations prove the possibility of conducting accurate seizure detection using quickly-mountable dry-electrode headsets without the need for uncomfortable/painful through-hair electrodes or adhesive material. The compact VLSI implementation of the algorithm is also presented and resource optimization techniques are discussed. The optimized implementation is uploaded on an Actel Igloo AGL250 low-power FPGA, requires 1237 logic elements, consumes 110 mu W dynamic power, and yields a detection latency of 10.2 mu s. The measurement results from the FPGA implementation on data from 23 patients (198 seizures in total) shows a seizure detection sensitivity and specificity of 92.5% and 80.1%, respectively.

To minimize the training time for a novice user, the user-dependent factors must be studied. we have presented a comparative analysis of novice/expert information flow patterns. We have used Normalized Transfer Entropy (NTE) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate the differences. The experiment was divided into three cognitive states i.e., rest, drawing, and manipulation. We applied classification algorithms on NTE matrices and graph theory measures to see the effectiveness of NTE. The results revealed that the experts show approximately the same cognitive activation in drawing and manipulation states, whereas for novices the brain activation is more in manipulation state than drawing state. The hemisphere- and lobe-wise analysis showed that expert users have developed an ability to control the information flow in various brain regions. On the other hand, novice users have shown a continuous increase in information flow activity in almost all regions when doing drawing and manipulation tasks. A classification accuracy of more than 90% was achieved with a simple K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to classify novice and expert users. The results showed that the proposed technique can be used to develop adaptive 3D modelling systems.

Recognizing emotions is a challenging task due to the non-linear property of the EEG signal. This paper presents an advanced signal processing method using the deep neural network (DNN) for emotion recognition based on EEG signals. The spectral and temporal components of the raw EEG signal are first retained in the 2D Spectrogram before the extraction of features. The pre-trained AlexNet model is used to extract the raw features from the 2D Spectrogram for each channel. To reduce the feature dimensionality, spatial, and temporal based, bag of deep features (BoDF) model is proposed. A series of vocabularies consisting of 10 cluster centers of each class is calculated using the k-means cluster algorithm. Lastly, the emotion of each subject is represented using the histogram of the vocabulary set collected from the raw-feature of a single channel. Features extracted from the proposed BoDF model have considerably smaller dimensions. The proposed model achieves better classification accuracy compared to the recently reported work when validated on SJTU SEED and DEAP data sets. For optimal classification performance, we use a support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) to classify the extracted features for the different emotional states of the two data sets. The BoDF model achieves 93.8% accuracy in the SEED data set and 77.4% accuracy in the DEAP data set, which is more accurate compared to other state-of-the-art methods of human emotion recognition.

However, there are many observations need to be verified. In our paper, we focus on the gender recognition in emotion perception using diverse EEG (electroencephalogram) features. The time-frequency and phase locked value (PLV) features are extracted and different feature selection methods are compared. We performed these methods on DEAP dataset. Results show that 1) the gender recognition accuracy using PLV feature is higher than using traditional time-frequency feature. 2) extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier has the best performance. 3) the gender recognition accuracy of theta and gamma bands is higher than other bands, which indicates that theta and gamma bands contain more discriminate gender information. 4) arousal has a greater impact than valence. And recognition accuracy of 'calm' emotion is lower than other emotions 5) feature selection methods can improve the accuracy.

The HCI system mainly consists of three subsystems, including the interface switching, decision and semi-autonomous navigation. The interface switching subsystem is accomplished by detecting the eyeblink EOG. The continuous wavelet transform is employed to indentify eyeblink features which are used to switch interfaces between horizontal and vertical motor imagery (MI) tasks. The average accuracy of the eyeblink feature detection reaches to 97.95%. The decision subsystem employs the joint regression (JR) model and spectral powers methods to extract the time and frequency domain features of MI tasks by analyzing the left- and right-hand MI EEG. Simultaneously, the support vector machine is applied to accomplish the MI tasks classification and final decision. The average classification accuracy of the HCI system reaches to 93.99%. The semi-autonomous navigation subsystem extracts the environmental features to avoid obstacles semi-automatically in 3D space and provide feasible directions for the decision subsystem. The actual indoor 3D space target searching experiments are put forward to verify the feasibility and adaptation performances of this proposed HCI system.

While it is intuitively and statistically appealing to rely on readings from more than one individual in order to highlight recurrent patterns of brain activation, pooling information across subjects presents nontrivial methodological problems. We discuss some of the scientific issues associated with the understanding of synchronized neuronal activity and propose a methodological framework for statistical inference from a sample of EEG readings. Our work builds on classical contributions in time-series, clustering, and functional data analysis, in an effort to reframe a challenging inferential problem in the context of familiar analytical techniques. Some attention is paid to computational issues, with a proposal based on the combination of machine learning and Bayesian techniques.

Currently, two of the most popular biometric authentication systems are fingerprint and facial recognition. However, both of these biometrics become unusable once compromised. Also, an attacker might coerce the user to force authentication. Therefore, we propose an authentication mechanism that depends on the participant's neurological responses to chosen pieces of music measured using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The current study proposes an authentication system that uses neurological responses to music for classification. Participants listened to individually selected music and music selected by other participants during an EEG reading. The change in the Alpha and Beta band frequencies across seven electrodes served as the input to a user specific K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The classifier attempts to determine if we can identify a user based on their EEG response to music. Our pilot data collection and analysis has shown promise of this authentication system with an accuracy rate between 76.4%-92.3%.	[Cauthen, Joseph M.; Gandre, Tejas; Espinoza, Marco A.

However, the demands of actual rehabilitation are becoming increasingly rigorous, requiring that processes be completed within tens of minutes. Therefore, we developed a new effective rehabilitation system for treating patients such as those with stroke hemiplegia. The system can smoothly perform rehabilitation training on the day of admission to the hospital. We designed a heuristic BCI with simplified fuzzy reasoning, which can detect motor intention signals from an electroencephalogram (EEG) within several tens of minutes. The detected signal is sent to the newly developed ankle rehabilitation device (ARD), and the patient repeats the dorsiflexion motion by the ARD.

Currently, visual interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the main modality used in outcome prediction. There is a growing interest in computer-assisted EEG interpretation, either to overcome the possible subjectivity of visual interpretation, or to identify complex features of the EEG signal. We used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict functional outcome based on 19-channel-EEG recorded from 267 adult comatose patients during targeted temperature management after CA. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the test set was 0.885. Interestingly, model architecture and fine-tuning only played a marginal role in classification performance. We then used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) as visualization technique to identify which EEG features were used by the network to classify an EEG epoch as favorable or unfavorable outcome, and also to understand failures of the network. Grad-CAM showed that the network relied on similar features than classical visual analysis for predicting unfavorable outcome (suppressed background, epileptiform transients). This study confirms that CNNs are promising models for EEG-based prognostication in comatose patients, and that Grad-CAM can provide explanation for the models' decision-making, which is of utmost importance for future use of deep learning models in a clinical setting.

We experimentally validate the proposed supervised subspace learning technique and compared it against Multilinear Principal Component Analysis using a publicly available hyper-spectral imaging dataset. Experimental results indicate that the proposed CMP method can efficiently reduce the dimensionality of tensor objects, while, at the same time, increasing the inter-class separability.

To obtain enough training trials, participants must spend a long time in the calibration stage. In this paper, we propose a new framework to reduce the calibration time through knowledge transferred from the electroencephalogram (EEG) of other subjects. We trained the motor recognition model for the target subject using both the target's EEG signal and the EEG signals of other subjects. To reduce the individual variation of different datasets, we proposed two data mapping methods. These two methods separately diminished the variation caused by dissimilarities in the brain activation region and the strength of the brain activation in different subjects. After these data mapping stages, we adopted an ensemble method to aggregate the EEG signals from all subjects into a final model. We compared our method with other methods that reduce the calibration time. The results showed that our method achieves a satisfactory recognition accuracy using very few training trials (32 samples). Compared with existing methods using few training trials, our method achieved much greater accuracy.

Unlike choice-response tasks with two response alternatives, the accuracy in a force production paradigm is defined as an area between an upper and lower limit on the force continuum. In the present study, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying force production. We used a force production task in which the participants (n = 48) were asked to exert a brief force pulse within a specific force range. This allowed: (1) investigation of action monitoring activity during force execution using response-locked and feedback-locked event-related potential (ERP) components known to be involved in error monitoring; (2) multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for ERPs. We found that the different force production ranges (characterised as too low, correct, and too high with respect to the target force range) showed no clear error-specific variations in the ERP components of interest. MVPA, on the other hand, allowed for successful classification, not only between the correct and the incorrect outcome conditions, but also between the two incorrect outcome conditions. This suggests that the classifier identified neural patterns reflecting the force magnitude rather than the correctness of a response. Moreover, additional support-vector regression (SVR) analyses showed that single-trial response parameters (i.e. peak force and time-to-peak) could be decoded from the brain activity pattern starting from 140 ms (for peak force) and 270 ms (for time-to-peak) before the response onset. These results indicate that the motor program defined the magnitude and timing of the force pulse before response execution, while the correctness of that response (in relation to the "default force" required) was not yet foreshadowed in neural signals. Finally, this study presents the first evidence of a post-error force adjustment mechanism, for which participants produced a higher force in trials after under-producing the required force, and a lower force in trials after over-producing the required force.

The developed system is based on the detection of motor imagery (MI) task from electroencephalogram (EEG) signal through classification and translating it to control the movements of an artificial hand. B-Alert EEG headset is used for the recording of 9 EEG channels data and communicates with a personal computer that runs AcqKnowledge 4.1 for acquiring desired EEG data from the headset. The recorded signals are Cross-correlated (CC) to extract optimal features and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used to classify the different MI tasks. The output of the developed CC-SVM system is interfaced with a microcontroller that receives commands and decodes them for controlling the movements of the hand attached to it. The result suggests that patients with severe motor disabilities can be rehabilitated through this system.

Optimising non-invasive brain-computer interface systems for free communication between nave human participants	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EEG	Free communication is one of the cornerstones of modern civilisation. While manual keyboards currently allow us to interface with computers and manifest our thoughts, a next frontier is communication without manual input. Brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers often achieve this by decoding patterns of neural activity as users attend to flickering keyboard displays. To date, the highest performing spellers report typing rates of similar to 10.00 words/minute. While impressive, these rates are typically calculated for experienced users repetitively typing single phrases. It is therefore not clear whether naive users are able to achieve such high rates with the added cognitive load of genuine free communication, which involves continuously generating and spelling novel words and phrases. In two experiments, we developed an open-source, high-performance, non-invasive BCI speller and examined its feasibility for free communication. The BCI speller required users to focus their visual attention on a flickering keyboard display, thereby producing unique cortical activity patterns for each key, which were decoded using filter-bank canonical correlation analysis. In Experiment 1, we tested whether seventeen naive users could maintain rapid typing during prompted free word association. We found that information transfer rates were indeed slower during this free communication task than during typing of a cued character sequence. In Experiment 2, we further evaluated the speller's efficacy for free communication by developing a messaging interface, allowing users to engage in free conversation. The results showed that free communication was possible, but that information transfer was reduced by voluntary textual corrections and turn-taking during conversation. We evaluated a number of factors affecting the suitability of BCI spellers for free communication, and make specific recommendations for improving classification accuracy and usability. Overall, we found that developing a BCI speller for free communication requires a focus on usability over reduced character selection time, and as such, future performance appraisals should be based on genuine free communication scenarios.

However, the diversity of seizures among patients makes it difficult to develop universal features that are applicable for automatic seizure detection in all cases, and the rarity of seizures results in a lack of sufficient training data for classifiers. Methods: To overcome these problems, we utilized an autoencoder (AE), which is often used for anomaly detection in the field of machine learning, to perform seizure detection. We hypothesized that multichannel EEG signals are compressible by AE owing to their spatio-temporal coupling and that the AE should be able to detect seizures as anomalous events from an interictal EEG. Results: Through experiments, we found that the AE error was able to classify seizure and nonseizure states with a sensitivity of 100% in 22 out of 24 available test subjects and that the AE was better than the commercially available software BESA and Persyst for half of the test subjects. Conclusions: These results suggest that the AE error is a feasible candidate for a universal seizure detection feature.

Riemannian geometry and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) are applied on the filtered EEG for spatial feature extraction, which later are used by the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier for motor imagery (MI) recognition. Three bipolar EEG channels were used on six healthy subjects to acquire our database, composed of two classes: rest state and shoulder flexion/extension MI. Our system achieved a mean accuracy (ACC) of 75.12% applying Riemannian, with the highest performance for Subject S01 (ACC = 89.68%, Kappa = 79.37%, true positive rate (TPR) = 87.50%, and FPR < 8.13%). In contrast, for CSP, a mean ACC of 66.29% was achieved. These findings suggest that unsupervised methods for feature extraction, such as Riemannian geometry, can be suitable for shoulder flexion/extension MI to command an upper-limb robotic exoskeleton.

To address this challenge, we conducted offline analyses and online experiments to test whether the classification of different types of motor imagery could be improved when the training of the classifier was performed on the data obtained with the assistive muscular stimulation below the motor threshold. 10 healthy participants underwent three different types of experimental conditions: a) Motor imagery (MI) of hands and feet b) sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation (STM) of hands and feet while resting and c) sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation during performance of motor imagery (BOTH). Also, another group of 10 participants underwent conditions a) and c). Then, online experiments with 15 users were performed. These subjects received neurofeedback during MI using classifiers calibrated either on MI or BOTH data recorded in the same experiment. Offline analyses showed that decoding MI alone using a classifier based on BOTH resulted in a better BCI accuracy compared to using a classifier based on MI alone. Online experiments confirmed accuracy improvement of MI alone being decoded with the classifier trained on BOTH data. In addition, we observed that the performance in MI condition could be predicted on the basis of a more pronounced connectivity within sensorimotor areas in the frequency bands providing the best performance in BOTH. These finding might offer a new avenue for training SMR-based BCI systems particularly for users having difficulties to achieve efficient BCI control. It might also be an alternative strategy for users who cannot perform real movements but still have remaining afferent pathways (e.g., ALS and stroke patients).

J	Li, C; Jia, TY; Xu, Q; Ji, LH; Pan, Y				Li, Chong; Jia, Tianyu; Xu, Quan; Ji, Linhong; Pan, Yu			Brain-Computer Interface Channel-Selection Strategy Based on Analysis of Event-Related Desynchronization Topography in Stroke Patients	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; UPPER-LIMB; REHABILITATION; ACTIVATION; BCI	In the last decade, technology-assisted stroke rehabilitation has been the focus of research. Electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has a great potential for motor rehabilitation in stroke patients since the closed loop between motor intention and the actual movement established by BCI can stimulate the neural pathways of motor control. Due to the deficits in the brain, motor intention expression may shift to other brain regions during and even after neural reorganization. The objective of this paper was to study the event-related desynchronization (ERD) topography during motor attempt tasks of the paretic hand in stroke patients and compare the classification performance using different channel-selection strategies in EEG-based BCI. Fifteen stroke patients were recruited in this study. A cue-based experimental paradigm was applied in the experiment, in which each patient was required to open the palm of the paretic or the unaffected hand. EEG was recorded and analyzed to measure the motor intention and indicate the activated brain regions. Support vector machine (SVM) combined with common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used to calculate the offline classification accuracy between the motor attempt of the paretic hand and the resting state applying different channel-selection strategies. Results showed individualized ERD topography during the motor attempt of the paretic hand due to the deficits caused by stroke. Statistical analysis showed a significant increase in the classification accuracy by analyzing the channels showing ERD than analyzing the channels from the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (SM1). The results indicated that for stroke patients whose affected motor cortex is extensively damaged, the compensated brain regions should be considered for implementing EEG-based BCI for motor rehabilitation as the closed loop between the altered activated brain regions and the paretic hand can be stimulated more accurately using the individualized channel-selection strategy.

Mental Effort and Information-Processing Costs Are Inversely Related to Global Brain Free Energy During Visual Categorization	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain free energy; mental effort; information-processing costs; visual categorization; electroencephalography	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; WORKLOAD; SYSTEMS; MODELS; REWARD; CLASSIFICATION; CRITICALITY; PERCEPTION; PRINCIPLE	Mental effort is a neurocognitive process that reflects the controlled expenditure of psychological information-processing resources during perception, cognition, and action. There is a practical need to operationalize and measure mental effort in order to minimize detrimental effects of mental fatigue on real-world human performance. Previous research has identified several neurocognitive indices of mental effort, but these indices are indirect measures that are also sensitive to experimental demands or general factors such as sympathetic arousal. The present study investigated a potential direct neurocognitive index of mental effort based in theories where bounded rational decision makers (realized as embodied brains) are modeled as generalized thermodynamic systems. This index is called free energy, an information-theoretic system property of the brain that reflects the difference between the brain's current and predicted states. Theory predicts that task-related differences in a decision makers' free energy are inversely related to information-processing costs related to task decisions. The present study tested this prediction by quantifying global brain free energy from electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of human brain function. EEG signals were recorded while participants engaged in two visual categorization tasks in which categorization decisions resulted from the allocation of different levels of mental information processing resources. A novel method was developed to quantify brain free energy from machine learning classification of EEG trials. Participant information-processing resource costs were estimated via computational analysis of behavior, whereas the subjective expression of mental effort was estimated via participant ratings of mental workload. Following theoretical predictions, task-related differences in brain free energy negatively correlated with increased allocation of information-processing resource costs. These brain free energy differences were smaller for the visual categorization task that required a greater versus lesser allocation of information-processing resources. Ratings of mental workload were positively correlated with information-processing resource costs, and negatively correlated with global brain free energy differences, only for the categorization task requiring the larger amount of information-processing resource costs. These findings support theoretical thermodynamic approaches to decision making and provide the first empirical evidence of a relationship between mental effort, brain free energy, and neurocognitive information-processing.

Detection and Prediction of Microsleeps from EEG using Spatio-Temporal Patterns	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY				COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SLEEP	A microsleep is a brief lapse in performance due to an involuntary sleep-related loss of consciousness. These episodes are of particular importance in occupations requiring extended unimpaired visuomotor performance, such as driving. Detection and even prediction of microsleeps has the potential to prevent catastrophic events and fatal accidents. In this study, we examined detection and prediction of microsleeps using EEG data of 8 subjects who performed two 1-h sessions of continuous 1-D tracking. A regularized spatio-temporal filtering and classification (RSTFC) method was used to extract features from 5-s EEG segments. These features were then used to train three different linear classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), and variational Bayesian logistic regression (VBLR). The performance of microsleep state detection and prediction was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The detection performance measures were AUC(ROC) 0.96, AUC(PR) 0.52, and phi 0.47. As expected, prediction of microsleep states with a 0.25-s ahead prediction time resulted in slightly lower performances compared to the detection. Prediction performance measures were substantially higher than those achieved with log-power spectral features, i.e., AUC(ROC) 0.95 (cf. 0.90), AUC(PR) 0.50 (cf. 0.36), and phi 0.46 (cf. 0.34).

Deep-learning for seizure forecasting in canines with epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						real-time seizure forecasting; epilepsy; canine epilepsy; machine learning; deep learning; convolutional neural networks (CNN); Monte Carlo simulation	LONG-TERM; PREDICTION; SYSTEM	Objective. This paper introduces a fully automated, subject-specific deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) system for forecasting seizures using ambulatory intracranial EEG (iEEG). The system was tested on a hand-held device (Mayo Epilepsy Assist Device) in a pseudo-prospective mode using iEEG from four canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Approach. The system was trained and tested on 75 seizures collected over 1608 d utilizing a genetic algorithm to optimize forecasting hyper-parameters (prediction horizon (PH), median filter window length, and probability threshold) for each subject-specific seizure forecasting model. The trained CNN models were deployed on a hand-held tablet computer and tested on testing iEEG datasets from four canines. The results from the iEEG testing datasets were compared with Monte Carlo simulations using a Poisson random predictor with equal time in warning to evaluate seizure forecasting performance. Main results. The results show the CNN models forecasted seizures at rates significantly above chance in all four dogs (p < 0.01, with mean 0.79 sensitivity and 18% time in warning). The deep learning method presented here surpassed the performance of previously reported methods using computationally expensive features with standard machine learning methods like logistic regression and support vector machine classifiers. Significance. Our findings principally support the feasibility of deploying trained CNN models on a hand-held computational device (Mayo Epilepsy Assist Device) that analyzes streaming iEEG data for real-time seizure forecasting.

Firstly, the TQWT is utilized to decompose the filtered EEG signal. Then, several sub-band signals are extracted and followed by calculating their energy, AutoRegressive (AR) model coefficients and fractal dimension. Finally, a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier is used to classify these EEGs. Two Graz datasets of BCI Competition 2003 and 2005 are employed to verify the proposed method. The maximum accuracy of classifying EEGs of four subjects is 88.11%, 89.33%, 77.13% and 78.80%, respectively, and the maximum mutual information is 0.95, 0.96, 0.43 and 0.45. The high accuracies and mutual information demonstrate eventually the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, the recognition accuracy of conventional methods is usually not satisfactory because of the inconsistent distribution of training and testing data in practical applications. To overcome this problem, we used cross-domain mean joint approximation embedding (CMJAE) transductive transfer learning method to realize the knowledge transfer from the training data to the testing data by measuring the distribution difference between them. We combined the subspace learning and joint distribution to adapt the marginal and conditional distribution discrepancy. Our method was able to effectively learn a model for the testing data from training data with different distribution at a low computational complexity cost. On a public dataset, an ad- hoc cross-validation scheme of the proposed method exhibited that the average recognition accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of different states was 97.5%, 94.3%, 92.7% respectively, much better than conventional machine learning or deep learning methods, which may serve as a promising strategy for epileptic states recognition algorithms.

Teenagers and young adult aged of 16-30 years old are the most common victims. Mental health is a really serious issue concerning emotional health. One of the causes on emotional health issues is a lack of self-awareness, which is the key cornerstone on maintaining emotional state. In this study, EEG Neurostyle of 24 channels was used to obtain brain electrical signals. The mental emotions of the subjects were obtained from their reactions due to a set of audio-visual stimuli of approximately 5 minutes, the subject consists of 6 subjects aged 18-22 years old. The expressions of the subjects were recorded EEG signals separately to ensure their emotion according to the source (i.e. sad clips resulting sad emotion). The signals were processed using DFT and PSD to extract their features. The features were used to classify the emotions into 4 classes: happy, sad, scared, and disgust. In this study, the k-NN as classifier was used and obtained training and testing accuracy for all the features were greater than 52 % and 30 % for 4 classes.	[Yusuf, A. A.; Wijaya, S.

To select a number, the user could focus on the corresponding button when it was flashing. Five epileptic patients implanted with SEEG electrodes attended the experiment and achieved an average online accuracy of 97.33%. Moreover, through single contact decoding and simulated online analysis, we found that these subjects achieved an average accuracy of 82.00% using a single channel of signal. These results indicated that our SEEG-based BCI had a high performance, which was mainly because of the high quality of SEEG signals.

We investigated whether P300 features in both sensor-level and source-level could be effectively used to classify post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: EEG signals were recorded from fifty-one PTSD patients, 67 MDD patients, and 39 healthy controls (HCs) while performing an auditory oddball task. Amplitude and latency of P300 were evaluated, and the current source analysis of P300 components was conducted using sLORETA. Finally, we classified two groups using machine-learning methods with both sensor- and source-level features. Moreover, we checked the comorbidity effects using the same approaches (PTSD-mono diagnosis (PTSDm, n = 28) and PTSD-comorbid diagnosis (PTSDc, n = 23)). Results: PTSD showed significantly reduced P300 amplitudes and prolonged latency compared to HCs and MDD. Moreover, PTSD showed significantly reduced source activities, and the source activities were significantly correlated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Also, the best classification accuracy at each pair was as follows: 80.00% (PTSD-HCs), 67.92% (MDD-HCs), 70.34% (PTSD-MDD), 82.09% (PTSDm-HCs), 71.58% (PTSDm-MDD), 82.56% (PTSDc-HCs), and 76.67% (PTSDc- MDD). Conclusion: Since abnormal P300 reflects pathophysiological characteristics of PTSD, PTSD patients were welldiscriminated from MDD and HCs when using P300 features. Thus, altered P300 characteristics in both sensorand source-level may be useful biomarkers to diagnosis PTSD.

The dataset consists of 76 sessions collected from 19 male and female users performing different versions of a cognitive task inspired by the principles of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a popular cognitive test in experimental and clinical psychology designed to assess cognitive flexibility, reasoning, and specific aspects of cognitive functioning. During each session, we record and fully annotate user EEG functionality, facial keypoints, real-time self-reports on cognitive fatigue, as well as detailed information of the performance metrics achieved during the cognitive task (success rate, response time, number of errors, etc.). Along with the dataset we provide free access to the CogBeacon data-collection software to provide a standardized mechanism to the community for collecting and annotating physiological and behavioral data for cognitive fatigue analysis. Our goal is to provide other researchers with the tools to expand or modify the functionalities of the CogBeacon data-collection framework in a hardware-independent way. As a proof of concept we show some preliminary machine learning-based experiments on cognitive fatigue detection using the EEG information and the subjective user reports as ground truth. Our experiments highlight the meaningfulness of the current dataset, and encourage our efforts towards expanding the CogBeacon platform. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal dataset specifically designed to assess cognitive fatigue and the only free software available to allow experiment reproducibility for multi-modal cognitive fatigue analysis.

New Approaches to Studying Silent Mesial Temporal Lobe Seizures in Alzheimer's Disease	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						foramen ovale electrode; Alzheimer; epilepsy; temporal lobe; machine learning	FORAMEN OVALE ELECTRODES; SIMULTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL EEG; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; AMYLOID-BETA; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION; MOUSE MODEL; EPILEPSY; SPIKES; FMRI	Silent seizures were discovered in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease over 10 years ago, yet it remains unclear whether these seizures are a salient feature of Alzheimer's disease in humans. Seizures that arise early in the course of Alzheimer's disease most likely originate from the mesial temporal lobe, one of the first structures affected by Alzheimer's disease pathology and one of the most epileptogenic regions of the brain. Several factors greatly limit our ability to identify mesial temporal lobe seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease, however. First, mesial temporal lobe seizures can be difficult to recognize clinically, as their accompanying symptoms are often subtle or even non-existent. Second, electrical activity arising from the mesial temporal lobe is largely invisible on the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), the mainstay of diagnosis for epilepsy in this population. In this review, we will describe two new approaches being used to study silent mesial temporal lobe seizures in Alzheimer's disease. We will first describe the methodology and application of foramen ovale electrodes, which captured the first recordings of silent mesial temporal lobe seizures in humans with Alzheimer's disease. We will then describe machine learning approaches being developed to non-invasively identify silent mesial temporal lobe seizures on scalp EEG. Both of these tools have the potential to elucidate the role of silent seizures in humans with Alzheimer's disease, which could have important implications for early diagnosis, prognostication, and development of targeted therapies for this population.

Little is known, however, about the relation of sleep and the gradual cognitive changes over the adult life course. Sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns are potential markers of the cognitive progress. To test this hypothesis, we assessed sleep architecture and EEG of 167 men born in the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area in 1953, who, based on individual cognitive testing from early (similar to 18 years) to late adulthood (similar to 58 years), were divided into 85 subjects with negative and 82 with positive cognitive change over their adult life. Participants underwent standard polysomnography, including manual sleep scoring at age similar to 58 years. Features of sleep macrostructure were combined with a number of EEG features to distinguish between the two groups. EEG rhythmicity was assessed by spectral power analysis in frontal, central and occipital sites. Functional connectivity was measured by inter-hemispheric EEG coherence. Group differences were assessed by analysis of covariance (p < 0.05), including education and severity of depression as potential covariates. Subjects with cognitive decline exhibited lower sleep efficiency, reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and slower EEG rhythms during stage 2 non-REM sleep. Individually, none of these tendencies remained significant after multiple test correction; however, by combining them in a machine learning approach, the groups were separated with 72% accuracy (75% sensitivity, 67% specificity). Ongoing medical screenings are required to confirm the potential of sleep efficiency and sleep EEG patterns as signs of individual cognitive progress.	[Waser, Markus; Sorensen, Helge B.

It can reflect activity differences among multiple brain regions. In addition to activation difference, different emotions also involve different large-scale network during related information processing. In this paper, both information propagation patterns and activation difference in the brain were fused to improve the performance of emotional recognition. Methods: We constructed emotion-related brain networks with phase locking value and adopted a multiple feature fusion approach to combine the compensative activation and connection information for emotion recognition. Results: Recognition results on three public emotional databases demonstrated that the combined features are superior to either single feature based on power distribution or network character. Furthermore, the conducted feature fusion analysis revealed the common characters between activation and connection patterns involved in the positive, neutral, and negative emotions for information processing. Significance: The proposed feasible combination of both information propagation patterns and activation difference in the brain is meaningful for developing the effective human-computer interaction systems by adapting to human emotions in the real world applications.

Leveraging on this statistical dissimilarity, we propose a non-iterative robust classification algorithm to isolate, in time, these neuromodulations from the temporally disorganized but structured background activity while simultaneously incorporating temporal sparsity of the events. Specifically, we exploit the ability of correntropy to asses higher - order moments as well as imply the degree of similarity between two random variables in the joint space regulated by the kernel bandwidth. We test our algorithm on DREAMS Sleep Spindle Database and further elaborate on the hyperparameters introduced. Finally, we compare the performance of the algorithm with two algorithms designed on similar ideas; one of which is a quick, simple norm based technique while the other parallels the state-of-the-art Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) to achieve classification. The algorithm is able to match the performance of the state-of-the-art techniques while saving tremendously on computation time and complexity.					principe, jose/N-8099-2014						13	1	1	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1557-170X	1558-4615	978-1-5386-1311-5	IEEE ENG MED BIO			2019							5790	5793						4	Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BP5OL	31947168	Green Submitted			2022-08-02	WOS:000557295306051

Rolandic spikes are not pathognomonic for rolandic epilepsy and could be related to the area of discharges itself. The initial hypothesis was that even visually identical spikes have some difference, because of the different etiology, Objective: The aim of the study was to find the differences in rolandic spike morphology in two epilepsy groups, different by etiology, but presenting with visually identical spikes. Methods: A novel algorithm for automatic classification of interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) rolandic spikes according to the epilepsy type (Group I - patients with benign focal childhood epilepsy, self-limiting, with no causal lesion in the brain, Group II - patients with structural focal epilepsy) is proposed. The algorithm consists of three stages: 1) EEG spike detection, 2) determination of EEG spike parameters, 3) classification of EEG by epilepsy type based on estimated spike parameters. Automatic classification method is defined by artificial neural network. The algorithm has been trained and tested on a large data sample provided by Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos. Only those EEGs that were visually identical and inaccessible for manual clustering to the groups according the visual spike morphology and contained 50 or more spikes have been analyzed. Training and testing pools have been selected as non overlapping (containing different patients) data sets. Results: The proposed methodology let us to achieve up to 75% of accuracy of classification of EEG. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, discrimination between the two paradigms may be ambiguous because the user intention contains their original meaning. A clear distinction between the two paradigms may facilitate the active use of them leading to an intuitive BCI conversation system. In this study, we compared imagined speech and visual imagery in the perspective of its presence, spatial features, and classification performance based on electroencephalography. Seven subjects performed both imagined speech and visual imagery of twelve words/phrases. We showed the presence of the two paradigms, having distinct brain region from each other. The maximum thirteen-class classification accuracy including rest class was 34.2 % for imagined speech and 26.7 % for visual imagery. Therefore, we investigated the possibility of multiclass classification of more than ten classes in both paradigms, showing the potential of them to be used in the real world communication system. These findings could further be utilized in the intuitive communication for locked-in patients sending commands to the external world simply by thinking of 'the very thing' that the user wants to deliver.

From research to clinic: A sensor reduction method for high-density EEG neurofeedback systems	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Monte Carlo; EEG montage; Sensor reduction; Neurofeedback; Translational; Source localization	BRAIN	Objective: To accurately deliver a source-estimated neurofeedback (NF) signal developed on a 128-sensors EEG system on a reduced 32-sensors EEG system. Methods: A linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer algorithm was used to select the 64 sensors which contributed most highly to the source signal. Monte Carlo-based sampling was then used to randomly generate a large set of reduced 32-sensors montages from the 64 beamformer-selected sensors. The reduced montages were then tested for their ability to reproduce the 128-sensors NF. The high-performing montages were then pooled and analyzed by a k-means clustering machine learning algorithm to produce an optimized reduced 32-sensors montage. Results: Nearly 4500 high-performing montages were discovered from the Monte Carlo sampling. After statistically analyzing this pool of high performing montages, a set of refined 32-sensors montages was generated that could reproduce the 128-sensors NF with greater than 80% accuracy for 72% of the test population. Conclusion: Our Monte Carlo reduction method was used to create reliable reduced-sensors montages which could be used to deliver accurate NF in clinical settings. Significance: A translational pathway is now available by which high-density EEG-based NF measures can be delivered using clinically accessible low-density EEG systems.

J	Hosseini, SA				Hosseini, Seyyed Abed			DECODING VISUAL COVERT SELECTIVE SPATIAL ATTENTION BASED ON MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY SIGNALS	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-APPLICATIONS BASIS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; selective attention; spatial attention; visual covert attention	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MOTOR IMAGERY; MEG; ADULTS	This paper proposes a hybrid approach for inferring the target of visual covert selective spatial attention (VCSSA) from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. The MEG signal offers a higher spatial resolution and a lower distortion as compared with their competing brain signaling techniques, such as the electroencephalography signal. The proposed approach consists of removing global redundant patterns of MEG channels by surface Laplacian, feature extraction by Hurst exponent (H), 6th order Morlet coefficients (MCs), and Petrosian fractal dimension (PFD), standardization, feature ranking by statistical analysis, and classification by support vector machines (SVM). The results indicate that the combined use of the above elements can effectively decipher the cognitive process of VCSSA. In particular, using four-fold cross-validation, the proposed approach robustly predicts the location of the attended stimulus with an accuracy of up to 92.41% for distinguishing left from right. The results show that the fusion among wavelet coefficients and non-linear features is more robust than in other previous studies. The results also indicate that the VCSSA involves widespread functional brain activities, affecting more regions than temporal and parietal circuits. Finally, the comparison of the results with six other competing strategies indicates that a slightly higher average accuracy is obtained by the proposed approach on the same data.

J	Wang, ZM; Zhang, ZP; Wang, WL				Wang, Zhongmin; Zhang, Zhaoping; Wang, Wenlang			Emotion Recognition Based on Framework of BADEBA-SVM	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							EEG; SELECTION	Brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a new communication channel between human brain and computer. In order to eliminate uncorrelated channels to improve BCI performance and enhance user convenience with fewer channels, this paper proposes a new framework using binary adaptive differential evolution bat algorithm (BADEBA). The framework uses the important ideas of differential evolution algorithm and bat algorithm to select electroencephalograph (EEG) channels and intelligently optimizes the parameters of support vector machine (SVM). It combines wavelet packet transform (WPT) and common space pattern (CSP) to achieve the goal of using fewer channels to obtain the best classification accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated with a common data set (DEAP). The results show that, compared with genetic algorithm (GA), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and bat algorithm, the proposed BADEBA in this framework only uses eight channels to improve the classification accuracy by 13.63% in the valence dimension and seven channels to improve the classification accuracy by 15.22% in the arousal dimension. In addition, the spatial distribution of the best channels selected by this method is consistent with the existing knowledge of brain structure and neurophysiology, which shows the accuracy and validity of this method.

Despite two decades of research [2-7], it remains unknown how this could be instantiated at the neural level. To this aim, the present study combined behavior, electrophysiology and neuronal modeling to characterize how the human brain could treat a tool like an extended sensory "organ." As with the body, participants localize touches on a hand-held tool with near-perfect accuracy [7]. This behavior is owed to the ability of the somatosensory system to rapidly and efficiently use the tool as a tactile extension of the body. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we found that where a hand-held tool was touched was immediately coded in the neural dynamics of primary somatosensory and posterior parietal cortices of healthy participants. We found similar neural responses in a proprioceptively deafferented patient with spared touch perception, suggesting that location information is extracted from the rod's vibrational patterns. Simulations of mechanoreceptor responses [8] suggested that the speed at which these patterns are processed is highly efficient. A second EEG experiment showed that touches on the tool and arm surfaces were localized by similar stages of cortical processing. Multivariate decoding algorithms and cortical source reconstruction provided further evidence that early limb-based processes were repurposed to map touch on a tool. We propose that an elementary strategy the human brain uses to sense with tools is to recruit primary somatosensory dynamics otherwise devoted to the body.

Some preliminary neurophysiological evidences have been found with electroencephalography or autonomic nervous system measurements such as heart rate, skin conductance, etc. However, the brain's hemodynamic responses to different positive emotions remain largely unknown. In the present study, the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique was employed. With this tool, we for the first time reported recognizable discrete positive emotions using fNIRS signals. Thirteen participants watched 30 emotional video clips to elicit 10 typical kinds of positive emotions (joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, and love), and their frontal neural activities were simultaneously recorded with a 24-channel fNIRS system. The multidimensional scaling analysis of participants' subjective ratings on these 10 positive emotions revealed three distinct clusters, which could be interpreted as "playfulness" for amusement, joy, interest, "encouragement" for awe, gratitude, hope, inspiration, pride, and "harmony" for love, serenity. Hemodynamic responses to these three positive emotion clusters showed distinct patterns, and HbO-based individual-level binary classifications between them achieved an averaged accuracy of 73.79 +/- 11.49% (77.56 +/- 7.39% for encouragement vs. harmony, 73.29 +/- 11.87% for playfulness vs. harmony, 70.51 +/- 13.96% for encouragement vs. harmony). Benefited from fNIRS's high portability, low running cost and the relative robustness against motion and electrical artifacts, our findings provided support for implementing a more fine-grained emotion recognition system with subdivided positive emotion categories.

J	Li, MG; Wang, RT; Yang, JF; Duan, LJ				Li, Mingai; Wang, Ruotu; Yang, Jinfu; Duan, Lijuan			An Improved Refined Composite Multivariate Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy Method for MI-EEG Feature Extraction	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article								Feature extraction of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) has shown good application prospects in the field of medical health. Also, multivariate entropy-based feature extraction methods have been gradually applied to analyze complex multichannel biomedical signals, such as EEG and electromyography. Compared with traditional multivariate entropies, refined composite multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (RCmvMFE) overcomes the defect of unstable entropy values caused by the scale factor increase and is beneficial towards obtaining richer feature information. However, the coarse-grained process of RCmvMFE is mean filtered, which weakens Gaussian noise and is powerless against random impulse noise interference. This yields poor quality feature information and low accuracy classification. In this paper, RCmvMFE is improved (IRCmvMFE) by using composite filters in the coarse-grained procedure to enhance filter performance. Median filters are employed to remove the impulse noise interference from multichannel MI-EEG signals, and these filtered MI-EEGs are further smoothed by the mean filters. The multiscale IRCmvMFEs are calculated for all channels of composite filtered MI-EEGs, forming a feature vector, and a support vector machine is used for pattern classification. Based on two public datasets with different motor imagery tasks, the recognition results of 10x10-fold cross-validation achieved 99.43% and 99.86%, respectively, and the statistical analysis of experimental results was completed, showing the effectiveness of IRCmvMFE, as well. The proposed IRCmvMFE-based feature extraction method is superior compared to entropy-based and traditional methods.

Decoding the status of working memory representations in preparation of visual selection	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG decoding; Cognitive control; Task preparation; Neural oscillations; Visual attention; Visual search	EEG DYNAMICS DISSOCIATE; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; ALPHA; INFORMATION; BENEFITS; ATTENTION; SEARCH; PRIORITIZATION	Daily life is filled with sequences of multiple tasks, each with their own relevant perceptual input. Working memory needs to dissociate representations that drive attention towards currently relevant information from prospective representations that are needed for future tasks, but that until then should be prevented from guiding attention. Yet, little is known about how the brain initiates and controls such sequential prioritization of selection. In the current study we recorded EEG while subjects remembered a color as the target template for one of two sequential search tasks, thus making it either currently relevant (when it was the target for the first search) or prospectively relevant (when it was the target for the second search) prior to the task sequence. Using time-frequency specific linear classifiers, we were able to predict the priority status (current versus prospective) of the memory representation from multivariate patterns of delta (2-4 Hz) and non-lateralized alpha power (8-14 Hz) during both delay periods. The delta band was only transiently involved when initializing the priority status at the start of the first delay, or when switching priority during the second delay, which we interpret as reflecting the momentary top-down control over prioritization. In contrast, alpha power decoding was based on a more stable pattern of activity that generalized across time both within and between delay periods, which we interpret as reflecting a difference in the prioritized memory representations themselves. Taken together, we reveal the involvement of a complex, distributed and dynamic spatiotemporal landscape of frequency-specific oscillatory activity in controlling prioritization of information within working memory.

Unsupervised machine-learning classification of electrophysiologically active electrodes during human cognitive task performance	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CHANNEL SELECTION; MEMORY FORMATION; MOTOR-IMAGERY; BRAIN; RECORDINGS; POTENTIALS; STIMULI	Identification of active electrodes that record task-relevant neurophysiological activity is needed for clinical and industrial applications as well as for investigating brain functions. We developed an unsupervised, fully automated approach to classify active electrodes showing event-related intracranial EEG (iEEG) responses from 115 patients performing a free recall verbal memory task. Our approach employed new interpretable metrics that quantify spectral characteristics of the normalized iEEG signal based on power-in-band and synchrony measures. Unsupervised clustering of the metrics identified distinct sets of active electrodes across different subjects. In the total population of 11,869 electrodes, our method achieved 97% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity with the most efficient metric. We validated our results with anatomical localization revealing significantly greater distribution of active electrodes in brain regions that support verbal memory processing. We propose our machine-learning framework for objective and efficient classification and interpretation of electrophysiological signals of brain activities supporting memory and cognition.

Various machine learning algorithms have been applied to classify the emotion as a psychological measurement. However, good accuracy in measurements is yet to be achieved. This work proposes an approach to classify the different type of estimation in human being with improved accuracy. This work extracts several features from EEG brain signals and then optimize the set of features using the correlation matrix, information gain calculation, and recursive feature elimination method. The optimized feature set is then used in classification. For the classification technique, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm has been followed. The XGBoost algorithm works on the Gradient Boosting framework and follows linear model solver and tree learning concept. The results show that feature optimization followed by the XGBoost algorithm gives better classification accuracy. The proposed approach has been tested with DEAP data set. The proposed approach also has been compared with different classification algorithms, namely Naive Bayes, KNN, C4.5, Decision Tree, Random Forest algorithms. The results substantiate the efficacy in favor of the proposed approach.

Due to the close spatial representations on the motor cortex area of the brain, the discrimination of the different motor imagery tasks is challenging. In this paper, phase synchronization information was proposed to classify motor imagery EEG within the same limb. In addition, non-portable was compared with portable EEG acquisition equipment for the purpose of making the brain computer interface (BCI) system more practical. In the non-portable case, the average accuracy of the binary classification and 3-class classification was 60.6% and 42.7%. In the portable case, the average EEG decoding accuracy of 58.5% and 39.9% was achieved for the two and three tasks. Furthermore, in both two cases, different sets of electrode pairs got the similar results. Moreover, we found that the proposed phase information based method was less sensitive to the number of EEG channels and had less performance degradation in portable EEG equipment. These results show it is possible to use phase synchronization information to discriminate different motor imagery tasks within the same limb. Eventually, this will potentially make the control of neuroprosthesis or other rehabilitation device more natural and intuitive.

HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Hearing loss; Hearing aids; Mobile EEG; Cognitive speech processing; Envelope tracking; Auditory attention decoding	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MENTAL FATIGUE; INTELLIGIBILITY; COMPONENT; PSYCHOPHYSICS; ENTRAINMENT; N400; N2	Objective: It has been suggested that the next major advancement in hearing aid (HA) technology needs to include cognitive feedback from the user to control HA functionality. In order to enable automatic brainwave-steered HA adjustments, attentional processes underlying speech-in-noise perception in aided hearing-impaired individuals need to be better understood. Here, we addressed the influence of two important factors for the listening performance of HA users hearing aid processing and motivation by analysing ongoing neural responses during long-term listening to continuous noisy speech. Methods: Sixteen normal-hearing (NH) and 15 linearly aided hearing-impaired (aHI) participants listened to an audiobook recording embedded in realistic speech babble noise at individually adjusted signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A HA simulator was used for simulating a directional microphone setting as well as for providing individual amplification. To assess listening performance behaviourally, participants answered questions about the contents of the audiobook. We manipulated (1) the participants' motivation by offering a monetary reward for good listening performance in one half of the measurements and (2) the SNR by engaging/disengaging the directional microphone setting. During the speech-in-noise task, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded using wireless, mobile hardware. EEG correlates of listening performance were investigated using EEG impulse responses, as estimated using the cross-correlation between the recorded EEG signal and the temporal envelope of the audiobook at the output of the HA simulator. Results: At the behavioural level, we observed better performance for the NH listeners than for the aHI listeners. Furthermore, the directional microphone setting led to better performance for both participant groups, and when the directional microphone setting was disengaged motivation also improved the performance of the aHI participants. Analysis of the EEG impulse responses showed faster N1-P2 responses for both groups and larger N2 peak amplitudes for the aHI group when the directional microphone setting was activated, but no physiological correlates of motivation. Significance: The results of this study indicate that motivation plays an important role for speech understanding in noise. In terms of neuro-steered HAs, our results suggest that the latency of attentional processes is influenced by HA-induced stimulus changes, which can potentially be used for inferring benefit from noise suppression processing automatically. Further research is necessary to identify the neural correlates of motivation as an exclusive top-down process and to combine such features with HA driven ones for online HA adjustments.

The proposed BCI operates on signals from eight EEG channels evenly distributed along the sensorimotor area. The acquired EEGs are then analyzed by using a symbolization method. Typically, the symbolization includes data-analysis algorithms that translate physical processes from experimental measurements into a series of discrete symbols (e.g., bit strings). For the BCI application, the chosen symbolization algorithm is the Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Since the selected LBP method uses binary operations for the whole processing chain (end-to-end), the complexity and the computing timing of the features extraction (FE) and real-time classification stages have been strongly reduced. Finally, a time-continuous Support Vector Machine (tcSVM) classifies the LBP-extracted features. The here proposed BCI algorithm has been validated on 3 subjects (aged 26 +/- 1), who underwent a stimulation protocol oriented to Movement-Related Potentials (MRPs) elicitation. The in-vivo validation showed how the system is able to reach an intention recognition accuracy of 85.61 +/- 1.19 %. In addition, starting from the complete data storage, the whole implemented computing chain asks, on average, for just similar to 3ms to provide the classification. As a proof of concept, the tcSVM outcomes have been used to drive, via Bluetooth, a 3D printed robotic hand.

The diverging statistical properties in different domains can lead to decay the prediction performance. The technical term for a change in the distribution of features is covariate shift, which also happens to be a common challenge in electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI); this is due to the presence of non-stationarities in the EEG signals. It is also the case that collecting and labelling samples is expensive, resulting in small datasets that are not in tune with the "big data" spirit that is the characteristic of the era. In this paper, we introduce a new method that handles domain adaptation in small datasets; the method combines elements of unsupervised domain adaptation with ensemble methods. We evaluate on real-world datasets corresponding to motor-imagery detection (BCI competition 2008 dataset 2A). The method produces state of the art results.

The proposed approach mainly depends on a feature extraction process that is conducted using a set of statistical tests. Among the many existing tests, those fit with processed data and for the purpose of the proposed approach were used. From each test, various output scalars were extracted and used as features in the proposed detection and classification task. Experiments that were conducted on the basis of a Bonn University dataset showed that the proposed approach had very accurate results (98.4%) in the detection task and outperformed state-of-the-art methods in a similar task on the same dataset. The proposed approach also had accurate results (94.0%) in the classification task, but it did not outperform state-of-the-art methods in a similar task on the same dataset. However, the proposed approach had less time complexity in comparison with those methods that achieved better results.

A Deep Evolutionary Approach to Bioinspired Classifier Optimisation for Brain-Machine Interaction	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							EEG; SYSTEM	This study suggests a new approach to EEG data classification by exploring the idea of using evolutionary computation to both select useful discriminative EEG features and optimise the topology of Artificial Neural Networks. An evolutionary algorithm is applied to select the most informative features from an initial set of 2550 EEG statistical features. Optimisation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is performed with an evolutionary approach before classification to estimate the best hyperparameters of the network. Deep learning and tuning with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are also explored, and Adaptive Boosting of the two types of models is tested for each problem. Three experiments are provided for comparison using different classifiers: one for attention state classification, one for emotional sentiment classification, and a third experiment in which the goal is to guess the number a subject is thinking of. The obtained results show that an Adaptive Boosted LSTM can achieve an accuracy of 84.44%, 97.06%, and 9.94% on the attentional, emotional, and number datasets, respectively. An evolutionary-optimised MLP achieves results close to the Adaptive Boosted LSTM for the two first experiments and significantly higher for the number-guessing experiment with an Adaptive Boosted DEvo MLP reaching 31.35%, while being significantly quicker to train and classify. In particular, the accuracy of the nonboosted DEvo MLP was of 79.81%, 96.11%, and 27.07% in the same benchmarks. Two datasets for the experiments were gathered using aMuse EEG headband with four electrodes corresponding to TP9, AF7, AF8, and TP10 locations of the international EEG placement standard. The EEG MindBigData digits dataset was gathered from the TP9, FP1, FP2, and TP10 locations.

BCI cinematics - A pre-release analyser for movies using H2O deep learning platform	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI cinematics; Machine learning, Movie analysis; Pre-release analysis; Deep learning, H2O framework		Entertainment industry has seen a phenomenal growth throughout the globe in recent times and movie industry enjoys a crucial role in the above emergence. A movie can capture the attention of a viewer and can trigger cognitive and emotional processes in the brain. In this article we assess the emotional outcome of the viewer while they watch the movie before its actual release that is, during its preview. Traditionally FMRI was used to assess the activity of brain but proved to be non-feasible and costly so we used EEG Sensors to monitor and record the functioning of the brain of movie viewer for further analysis. The collected data through EEG sensor were analysed using deep learning framework. H2O package of deep learning was employed to find high and low of different brain waves mapping to the emotions depicted in the every scene of the movie. Our proposed system named BCI cinematics obtained 85% accuracy and results were validated by obtaining the feedback from the stake holders. The outcome of this work will assist the creators to understand the emotional impact of movie over a normal viewer impartially thus enable them to modify certain scenes or change sequence of scenes and so on. When deployed in real time our system prove to be a cost saver for movie makers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kumar, Sundhara K.

In this study, a multi-domain hybrid feature pool is designed to identify most of the important information from the signal. The hybrid feature pool contains features from two types of analysis: (a) statistical parametric analysis from the time domain, and (b) wavelet-based bandwidth specific feature analysis from the time-frequency domain. Then, a wrapper-based feature selector, Boruta, is applied for ranking all the relevant features from that feature pool instead of considering only the non-redundant features. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is used for final classification. The proposed model yields an overall accuracy of 73.38% for the total considered dataset. To validate the performance of the proposed model and highlight the necessity of designing a hybrid feature pool, the model was compared to non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, as well as those without feature ranking.

Discrimination of Movement-Related Cortical Potentials Exploiting Unsupervised Learned Representations From ECoGs	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; electrocoticogram (ECoG); generative model; minimum description length (MDL); representation learning; temporal marked point process	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MACHINE INTERFACES; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HIGH-GAMMA; K-SVD; EEG; ALPHA; PHASE	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aim to bypass the peripheral nervous system to link the brain to external devices via successful modeling of decoding mechanisms. BCI based on electrocorticogram or ECoG represent a viable compromise between clinical practicality, spatial resolution, and signal quality when it comes to extracellular electrical potentials from local neuronal assemblies. Classic analysis of ECoG traces usually falls under the umbrella of Time-Frequency decompositions with adaptations from Fourier analysis and wavelets as its most prominent variants. However, analyzing such high-dimensional, multivariate time series demands for specialized signal processing and neurophysiological principles. We propose a generative model for single-channel ECoGs that is able to fully characterize reoccurring rhythm-specific neuromodulations as weighted activations of prototypical templates over time. The set of timings, weights and indexes comprise a temporal marked point process (TMPP) that accesses a set of bases from vector spaces of different dimensions-a dictionary. The shallow nature of the model admits the equivalence between latent variables and representations. In this way, learning the model parameters is a case of unsupervised representation learning. We exploit principles of Minimum Description Length (MDL) encoding to effectively yield a data-driven framework where prototypical neuromodulations (not restricted to a particular duration) can be estimated alongside the timings and features of the TMPP. We validate the proposed methodology on discrimination of movement-related tasks utilizing 32-electrode grids implanted in the frontal cortex of six epileptic subjects. We show that the learned representations from the high-gamma band (85-145 Hz) are not only interpretable, but also discriminant in a lower dimensional space. The results also underscore the practicality of our algorithm, i.e., 2 main hyperparameters that can be readily set via neurophysiology, and emphasize the need of principled and interpretable representation learning in order to model encoding mechanisms in the brain.

Through the BCI system, the multi-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification of Motor Imagery (MI) based on Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) can get a good result. However, when it comes to less channels, the classification's result is not so practical. This paper focuses on the improvement of less channels' accuracy. Through the methods of spectral feature and transformation based on Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD), the accuracy can improve 15.5% on average.

Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated that based on the high inter-individual variability of brain structure and function, it is possible to identify individuals with high accuracy. Otherwise, there is the common belief that electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded at the surface of the scalp are too noisy for identification purposes with a comparably high hit rate. In the present work, we compared BI quality (F1-scores, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) between different types of functional (instantaneous, lagged, and total coherence, phase synchronization, correlation, and mutual information) and effective (Granger causality, phase synchronization, and coherence) connectivity measures. Results revealed that across functional connectivity metrics, identification accuracy was in the range of 0.98-1, whereas sensitivity and Fl-scores were between 0.00 and 1 and specificity was between 0.99 and 1. BI was higher for the connectivity metrics that are contaminated by volume conduction (instantaneous connectivity) compared to those that are unaffected by this variable (lagged connectivity). Support vector machine and neural network algorithms yielded the highest BI, followed by random forest and weighted k-nearest neighborhood, whereas linear discriminant analysis was less accurate. These results provide cross-validated counterevidence to the belief that EEG data are too noisy for identification purposes and demonstrate that functional and effective connectivity metrics are particularly suited for BI applications with comparable accuracy to MRI. Our results have important implications for fast, low-cost, and mobile BI applications.

J	Olivas-Padilla, BE; Chacon-Murguia, MI				Olivas-Padilla, Brenda E.; Chacon-Murguia, Mario, I			Classification of multiple motor imagery using deep convolutional neural networks and spatial filters	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-Computer Interface (BCI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Motor imagery (MI); Multi-class classification; Convolutional neural network (CNN)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BCI	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are systems that translate brain activity patterns into commands for an interactive application, and some of them recognize patterns generated by motor imagery. Currently, these systems present performances and methodologies that still are not practical enough for realistic applications. Therefore, this paper proposes two methodologies for multiple motor imagery classification. Both methodologies use features extracted by a variant of Discriminative Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (DFBCSP) presented in this paper. The frequency bands selection in this variant is carried out by a novel iterative algorithm that selects the frequency band that attains the highest classification accuracy for specific binary classification. For each binary combination of classes, a frequency band is selected. The resulting samples are then set into a matrix which feeds one or many Convolutional Neural Networks previously optimized by using a Bayesian optimization. The first methodology applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of all classes and the second is a modular network composed of four expert CNNs. In this modular network, each expert CNN performs a binary classification, and a fully connected network analyzes their results. To validate both approaches two datasets were used, the BCI competition IV dataset 2a and another presented in this paper recorded from eight subjects by using the OpenBCI device. The experimental results demonstrated an improvement in the classification accuracy over many classic intelligent recognition methods, without a high computation time in order that they can be implemented in an online application.

The present study considered the neural activation pattern of action video game players under the resting condition for assessment. EEG data are collected from 16-male action video-game players (AVGPs) and 19-male non-video-game players (NVGPs) using 19-electrodes during eyes open (EO) resting states. Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity of participants are assessed by two consciousness index (CI) features, beta/theta and beta/alpha, computed using wavelet energies of theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Results show a higher level of resting state consciousness in AVGPs compared to NVGPs. When performances are evaluated using linear and nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), 93.97% classification accuracy is seen with beta/theta ratio whereas beta/alpha ratio produced 91.47% accuracy. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the effect of long-term gaming practice can be effectively analyzed by the wavelet transform based feature extraction technique described here.

Nevertheless, recent studies often focused on the effects of this disorder in the frequency content of single and multichannel EEG segments and only a few studies that employed the approximate entropy for estimating this reduction. In this study, we provide a different view of this reduction by focusing on the texture of patterns appeared on the auto-recurrence plots obtained from the phase space trajectories reconstructed from the EEG signals recorded under the open-eyes and closed-eyes resting conditions. The outcomes of this analysis generally indicated a significant difference in the texture of recurrence plots, which its reason was the increase of recurrence, parallel and similar behaviors in the trajectories. Evaluating the features extracted from these recurrence plots in the studied children without and with ADHD using the sequential forward selection (SFS) algorithm also provided a remarkable accuracy (90.95% for the testing sets), which is a confirmation on changing the texture of recurrence plots relevant to the EEG signals of ADHD children. Nevertheless, evaluating these results and the results of previous researches with each other represented that the volume of statistical population is an important factor for reducing the rate of separability in the classifiers developed by an EEG segment. Therefore, these findings generally proved that although the ADHD averagely leads to the complexity reduction of EEG processes, the classifiers developed by just an EEG segment cannot be applicable in clinical conditions.

Addressing this question requires time-resolved information about the strength of the different, potentially overlapping representations, on a trial-by-trial basis. Using a cued task-switching paradigm, we show that information about relevant representations can be extracted through decoding analyses from the scalp electrophysiological signal (EEG) with high temporal resolution. Peaks in representational strength-indexed through decoding accuracy-proceeded from superficial task cues, to stimulus locations, to features/responses. In addition, attentional-set representations were prominent throughout almost the entire processing cascade. Trial-by-trial analyses provided detailed information about when and to what degree different representations predict performance, with attentional settings emerging as a strong and consistent predictor of within-individual and across-individual variability in performance. Also, the strength of attentional sets was related to target representations early in the post-stimulus period and to feature/response representations at a later period, suggesting control of successive, lower-level representations in a concurrent manner. These results demonstrate a powerful approach towards uncovering different stages of information processing and their relative importance for performance.

In clinically obvious cases, generalized SWDs produce myoclonic, atonic/tonic, or absence seizures with brief episodes of staring and behavioral unresponsiveness. However, some generalized SWDs have no obvious behavioral effects. A serious challenge arises when patients with no clinical seizures request driving privileges and licensure, yet their EEG shows generalized SWD. Specialized behavioral testing has demonstrated prolonged reaction times or missed responses during SWD, which may present a driving hazard even when patients or family members do not notice any deficits. On the other hand, some SWDs are truly asymptomatic in which case driving privileges should not be restricted. Clinicians often decide on driving privileges based on SWD duration or other EEG features. However, there are currently no empirically-validated guidelines for distinguishing generalized SWDs that are "safe" versus "unsafe" for driving. Here, we review the clinical presentation of generalized SWD and recent work investigating mechanisms of behavioral impairment during SWD with implications for driving safety. As a future approach, computational analysis of large sets of EEG data during simulated driving utilizing machine learning could lead to powerful methods to classify generalized SWD as safe vs. unsafe. This may ultimately provide more objective EEG criteria to guide decisions on driving safety in people with epilepsy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Reactivation of Previous Experiences in a Working Memory Task	PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						serial dependence; working memory; ERP decoding; previous trial decoding; open data	REPETITION; STATES; BRAIN; EEG	Recent experiences influence the processing of new information even when those experiences are irrelevant to the current task. Does this reflect the indirect effects of a passively maintained representation of the previous experience, or is this representation reactivated when a new event occurs? To answer this question, we attempted to decode the orientation of the stimulus on the previous trial from the electroencephalogram on the current trial in a working memory task. Behavioral data confirmed that the previous-trial stimulus orientation influenced the reported orientation on the current trial, even though the previous-trial orientation was now task irrelevant. In two independent experiments, we found that the previous-trial orientation could be decoded from the current-trial electroencephalogram, indicating that the current-trial stimulus reactivated or boosted the representation of the previous-trial orientation. These results suggest that the effects of recent experiences on behavior are driven, in part, by a reactivation of those experiences and not solely by the indirect effects of passive memory traces.

Changes in Functional Connectivity Predict Outcome of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS); depression; functional connectivity; machine learning; electroencephalogram (EEG)	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RTMS TREATMENT; BASE-LINE; NONRESPONSE; BIOMARKERS; THERAPY; EXCITABILITY; MODULATION; MECHANISM; THETA	Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with changes in brain functional connectivity (FC). These changes may be related to the mechanism of action of rTMS and explain the variability in clinical outcome. We examined changes in electroencephalographic FC during the first rTMS treatment in 109 subjects treated with 10 Hz stimulation to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. All subjects subsequently received 30 treatments and clinical response was defined as >= 40% improvement in the inventory of depressive symptomatology-30 SR score at treatment 30. Connectivity change was assessed with coherence, envelope correlation, and a novel measure, alpha spectral correlation (alpha SC). Machine learning was used to develop predictive models of outcome for each connectivity measure, which were compared with prediction based upon early clinical improvement. Significant connectivity changes were associated with clinical outcome (P < 0.001). Machine learning models based on alpha SC yielded the most accurate prediction (area under the curve, AUC = 0.83), and performance improved when combined with early clinical improvement measures (AUC = 0.91). The initial rTMS treatment session produced robust changes in FC, which were significant predictors of clinical outcome of a full course of treatment for MDD.

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is characterized by stroke-like neurologic signs and symptoms in the absence of demonstrable structural neuropathology. There is no test for TIA, with classification often reliant on subjective, retrospective report. Functional brain measures such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) may be helpful in objectively detecting and describing the pathophysiology of TIA, but this has not been adequately examined. Methods. EEG was obtained from a single electrode over the left frontal lobe during 3-minute resting-state and auditory oddball conditions administered to consecutive patients within 72 hours of admission to the acute stroke ward of a tertiary hospital. Separately, patients were classified by their treating team as having suffered either an ischemic stroke (n = 10) or a TIA (n = 10). Relative power of delta, theta, alpha, and beta EEG frequency bands were extracted for comparison between the 2 clinical groups and an existing normative sample of 10 healthy, age-, gender-, and education-matched older adults. Results. Analysis of variance with post hoc testing identified pronounced delta activity in stroke patients, while alpha and beta power were elevated in TIA patients. Both patient groups exhibited attenuated theta activity compared with healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified thresholds for each EEG frequency capable of distinguishing the 3 participant groups. Conclusions. TIA, ischemic stroke, and healthy aging are each associated with distinct electrophysiological profiles. These preliminary findings suggest that acute EEG may be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiology and reversibility of TIA symptoms, and further exploration of the value of this unique functional brain data is encouraged.

Decoding the tradeoff between encoding and retrieval to predict memory for overlapping events	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; MVPA; Episodic memory; Encoding; Retrieval; Subsequent memory effect	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; EPISODIC MEMORY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-STIMULATION; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; INFORMATION; FREQUENCY; STATES	When new events overlap with past events, there is a natural tradeoff between encoding the new event and retrieving the past event. Given the ubiquity of overlap among memories, this tradeoff between memory encoding and retrieval is of central importance to computational models of episodic memory (O'Reilly & McClelland 1994; Hasselmo 2005). However, prior studies have not directly linked neural markers of encoding/retrieval tradeoffs to behavioral measures of how overlapping events are remembered. Here, by decoding patterns of scalp electro-encephalography (EEG) from male and female human subjects, we show that tradeoffs between encoding and retrieval states are reflected in distributed patterns of neural activity and, critically, these neural tradeoffs predict how overlapping events will later be remembered. Namely, new events that overlapped with past events were more likely to be subsequently remembered if neural patterns were biased toward a memory encoding state-or, conversely, away from a retrieval state. Additionally, we show that neural markers of encoding vs. retrieval states are surprisingly independent from previously-described EEG predictors of subsequent memory. Instead, we demonstrate that previously-described EEG predictors of subsequent memory are better explained by task engagement than by memory encoding, per se. Collectively, our findings provide important insight into how the memory system balances memory encoding and retrieval states and, more generally, into the neural mechanisms that support successful memory formation.

New Method: We aim to improve epileptogenic zone localization by utilizing a computer-assisted tool for the automated grading of the seizure activity recorded in various locations for 20 patients undergoing stereo electroencephalography. Their epileptic seizures were processed to extract two potential biomarkers. The concentration of these biomarkers from within each patient's implantation were then graded to identify their epileptogenic zone and were compared to the clinical assessment. Results: Our technique was capable of ranking the clinically defined epileptogenic zone with high accuracy, above 95%, with a true to false positive ratio of 1:1.52, and was effective with both temporal and extra-temporal onset epilepsies. Comparison with Existing Method: We compared our method to two other groups performing localization using similar biomarkers. Our classification metrics, sensitivity and precision together were comparable to both groups and our overall accuracy from a larger population was also higher then both. Conclusions: Our method is highly accurate, automated and non-parametric providing clinicians another tool that can be used to help identify the epileptogenic zone in patients undergoing the stereo electroencephalography procedure for epilepsy monitoring.

We examined semantic and syntactic violations from electroencephalogram (EEG) when participants listened to spoken sentences. Previous studies have shown that such event-related potential (ERP) components as N400 and the late positivity (P600) are evoked in the auditory where semantic and syntactic anomalies occur. We used this knowledge to detect language expectation violation from single-trial EEGs by machine learning techniques. We recorded the brain activity of 18 participants while they listened to sentences that contained semantic and syntactic anomalies and identified the significant main effects of these anomalies in the ERP components.

Nevertheless, the detection algorithms still lack robustness while processing brain signals. The aim would be to learn whether a person is deceitful or not by detection techniques and suggest a vigorous lie detection algorithm. Moreover, recently proposed algorithms for lie detection have shown to achieve a classification accuracy of around 96%. While different classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, multilaver neural network, Extreme Learning Machine, and Linear Discriminant Analysis have proposed which typically utilizes three different types of features like time domain features, frequency domain features, and wavelet features, are anticipated in the literature. Accordingly, in this research paper, we presented a lie detection system front the P300 wave. For automatic optimum feature learning, we applied an approach from deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is very effective for classification problems. The presented model significantly achieves high accuracy of 99.6%. The experimental outcomes show that the technique put forward achieves the maximum accuracy with a lesser amount of training and testing time and reveal improved performance. Additionally, an all-inclusive discussion on the choice of appropriate CNN architecture and classification results presented in this paper along with a comparison with the prior approaches of lie detection.

Epileptic patients are subjected to epileptic seizures that cause abnormal excessive brain activity. This condition affects approximately 5% of the world's population. Ideally, it is possible to detect and predict epilepsy. For detection, we can consider computer electroencephalograph, smart watches etc., whereas for prediction we can use machine learning artificial intelligence, phase correlation. Our objective is to survey different approaches to Epileptic seizure detection. In our work, we have pre-processed the EEG signal of both normal and Epileptic signal by using a Chebyshev filter. Later, we have used Wavelet analysis to decompose the filtered signal into five sub-levels. However, we have considered only the lower sub-level for further processing. The features are extracted using wavelet decomposition for further analysis.

The present study introduces Poincare-index(20-30 Hz), targeting the 20- to 30-Hz frequency, as the frequency range reported to contain large electromyogram (EMG) portions in frontal EEG. We combined Poincare-index(20-30 Hz) with the conventional Poincare-index(0.5-47 Hz) using a deep learning technique to adjust to BIS values, and examined whether this layered Poincare analysis can provide an index of anaesthesia level like BIS. A total of 83,867 datasets of these two Poincare-indices and BIS-monitor-derived parameters were continuously obtained every 3 s from 30 patients throughout general anaesthesia, and were randomly divided into 75% for a training dataset and 25% for a test dataset. Two Poincare-indices and two supplemental EEG parameters (EMG(70-110 Hz), suppression ratio) in the training dataset were trained in a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), with reference to BIS as supervisor. We then evaluated the trained MLPNN model using the test dataset, by comparing the measured BIS (mBIS) with BIS predicted from the model (PredBIS). The relationship between mBIS and PredBIS using the two Poincare-indices showed a tight linear regression equation: mBIS = 1.00 x PredBIS + 0.15, R = 0.87, p < 0.0001, root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.09, while the relationship between mBIS and PredBIS simply using the original Poincare-index(0.5-47 Hz) was weaker (R = 0.82, p < 0.0001, RMSE = 7.32). This suggests the 20- to 30-Hz hierarchical Poincare analysis has potential to improve on anaesthesia depth monitoring constructed by simple Poincare analysis.

The objective of this study was to develop a simple yet effective method of feature selection to improve the accuracy of a subject independent BCI algorithm and streamline the process of BCI algorithm development. Over the past several years, several high precision features have been suggested by researchers to classify different motor imagery tasks. This research applies fourteen of these features as a feature pool that can be used as a reference for future researchers. Additionally, we look for the most efficient feature or feature set with four different classifiers that best differentiates several motor imagery tasks. In this work we have successfully employed a feature fusion method to obtain the best sub-set of features. We have proposed a novel computer aided feature selection method to determine the best set of features for distinguishing between motor imagery tasks in lieu of the manual feature selection that has been performed in past studies. The features selected by this method were then fed into a Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, or support vector machine classifier for classification to determine the overall performance. Methods The methods used were a novel performance based additive feature fusion algorithm working in conjunction with machine learning in order to classify the motor imagery signals into particular states. The data used for this study was collected from BCI competition III dataset IVa. Result The result of this algorithm was a classification accuracy of 99% for a subject independent algorithm with less computation cost compared to traditional methods, in addition to multiple feature/classifier combinations that outperform current subject independent methods. Conclusion The conclusion of this study and its significance is that it developed a viable methodology for simple, efficient feature selection and BCI algorithm development, which leads to an overall increase in algorithm classification accuracy.

However, more systematic studies to quantify the effects of VR for emotion elicitation and compare the effects of 3D and 2D environment for the same is necessary to design feasible and effective treatments. In this study, we design a cross-over experiment protocol comprising of two emotion eliciting environments relaxation and arousal - that is presented to the participant either in a 2D monitor or a 3D head-mounted (HMD) VR display. The EEG data is collected during the experiment and analyzed offline to classify emotion elicited by low and high arousal environments using SVM classification of band power features. A 10-fold cross validation is performed and classification accuracy for each subject is computed for 3D-VR and 2D-screen display. The average classification accuracies over subjects are obtained as 66.88% and 59.27% in 3D-VR and 2D-screen group respectively. The performance difference between 3D-VR and 2D screen is statistically significant (p < 0.05), indicating that 3D-VR generates more distinct EEG patterns associated with emotion elicitation. Further, significant differences in band powers from alpha, theta and beta bands are also observed between both groups. The results presented in this paper support the use of VR as an effective tool to study emotion elicitation and regulation, compared to a 2D screen.

In this work, we consider the problem of eye-blink detection that can then be employed to reliably remove eye-blinks from EEG signals. We propose a fully automated and unsupervised eye-blink detection algorithm, Blink that self-learns user-specific brainwave profiles for eye-blinks. Hence, Blink does away with any user training or manual inspection requirements. Blink functions on a single channel EEG, and is capable of estimating the start and end timestamps of eye-blinks in a precise manner. We collect four different eye-blink datasets and annotate 2300+ eye-blinks to evaluate the robustness performance of Blink across headsets (OpenBCI and Muse), eye-blink types (voluntary and involuntary), and various user activities (watching a video, reading an article, and attending to an external stimulation). The Blink algorithm performs consistently with an accuracy of over 98% for all the tasks with an average precision of 0.934. The source code and annotated datasets are released publicly for reproducibility and further research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever annotated eye-blink EEG dataset released in the public domain.

In this paper, we applied a two-stage Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL-2S) method to electroencephalographic (EEG) data for online tracking of the relative evidence of activation of groups of cortical regions of interest (ROIs) comprising the nodes of two brain networks. Bayes factors (BF) are presented as measures of relative evidence for brain network activity. A second Kalman filter is used to predict behavior based on Bayes factors. The method is evaluated with simulated and real EEG data. EEG data was simulated by smoothly modulating the relative activations of canonical task positive network (TPN) and default mode networks (DMN). The calculated BFs (TPN/DMN) identified and tracked the changes in relative TPN and DMN network activation and accurately predicted simulated behavioral measures (reaction times to experiment events). The method was applied to EEG data from 8 subjects performing a lane-keeping simulated driving task in which the subjects were instructed to quickly respond to random perturbations of their vehicle's lane position. The estimated BFs showed significant linear and quadratic predictive relationships with response time (RT), with poorest task performance assocated with decreasing BF (increased DMN activation, relative to TPN). These results suggest that online estimation of BF for cortical network activation could be useful in the development of neuroscientifically grounded adaptive BMI systems.

The epilepsy is characterized by repeated seizures, occasioned by temporary electrical disturbances of the brain, and it is usually evidenced in four distinct events: pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal, and interictal. This disorder can be diagnosed by electroencephalogram (EEG), which is the result of brain electrical activity monitoring. In the current work, we built multiclass classifiers in order to differentiate EEG segments among normal, interictal, and ictal classes. For this, the multitaper method was computed to generate power spectrum, spectrogram, and bispectrogram from each EEG segment, in which a total of 102 features were extracted. For classifier building, we used all-against-all approach to decompose the multiclass problem into binary subproblems, in which the following machine learning algorithms were applied: random forest, 1-nearest-neighbor, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), backpropagation based on multilayer perceptron (BP-MLP), k-means based on radial basis function network (KM-RBFN), and sequential minimal optimization. In the evaluation by ten-fold stratified cross-validation, the BP-MLP reached the highest accuracy (98.33%). Afterward, an extremely significant statistical difference was found among classifiers. In a post hoc test application, it was proved that the KM-RBFN classifier reached an inferior performance compared to LDA and BP-MLP predictive models. All classifiers built in this work achieved promising results, in which accuracy above 90% was obtained for classification of EEG segments.

In this way, they can address the stability-plasticity dilemma. For this purpose, we combine two prominent computational neuroscience principles, namely Binding by Synchrony and Reinforcement Learning. The model learns to synchronize task-relevant modules, while also learning to desynchronize currently task-irrelevant modules. As a result, old (but currently task-irrelevant) information is protected from overwriting (stability) while new information can be learned quickly in currently task-relevant modules (plasticity). We combine learning to synchronize with task modules that learn via one of several classical learning algorithms (Rescorla-Wagner, backpropagation, Boltzmann machines). The resulting combined model is tested on a reversal learning paradigm where it must learn to switch between three different task rules. We demonstrate that our combined model has significant computational advantages over the original network without synchrony, in terms of both stability and plasticity. Importantly, the resulting models' processing dynamics are also consistent with empirical data and provide empirically testable hypotheses for future MEG/EEG studies.

Although the majority of late-onset epilepsies are of lesional origin, a considerable proportion of patients present with unknown etiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the semiological, electroencephalographic (EEG), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics as well as the 12-month seizure outcome in a cohort of patients with nonlesional lateonset epilepsy (>= 55 years). Method: A total of 54 patients with newly diagnosed nonlesional late-onset epilepsy (NUDE) were retrospectively evaluated for seizure type using the most recent International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of seizure types, EEG characteristics, and CSF profile and followed-up for at least 12 months after epilepsy onset. Results were compared with a gender-matched control group of 58 patients with nonlesional early-onset epilepsy (NLEOE). Results: The predominant seizure types in NLLOE were focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (30%) as well as focal onset impaired awareness motor seizures (IAMS) (22%) and focal onset impaired awareness nonmotor seizures (IANMS) (22%). The predominant seizure types in NLEOE were focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures (43%) as well as focal onset aware nonmotor seizures (ANMS) (31%) and JAMS (31%). Focal onset impaired awareness nonmotor seizures were found to be more characteristic in patients with NUDE (p - 0.019; alpha < 0.05; NLLOE: 22.2% vs. NLEOE: 8.6%). Electroencephalography revealed no significant differences between groups. Of interest, three patients with NLLOE (8%) presented with oligodonal bands (OCB) in CSF albeit absence of antineuronal antibodies. Seizure-free rate was 70%. Adverse effects from medication leading to antiepileptic drug (AED) change were reported in 12 patients (22%), valproate was the best tolerated AED in patients with NLLOE [adverse effects in 9%, compared with 12% (gabapentin) and 26% (levetiracelam)]. Conclusions: Using the most recent classification system, different patterns of semiological characteristics were identified: NLLOE more frequently present with IANMS, whereas patients with NLEOE rather have ANMS. Oligodonal bands were only detected in patients with NLLOE, indicating that careful exclusion of autoimmune encephalitis in this patient group is warranted. Our findings may help to more acatrately identify and characterize patients with NLLOE to improve targeted diagnostics and adequate treatment in this challenging group of patients.

J	Zeynali, M; Seyedarabi, H				Zeynali, Mahsa; Seyedarabi, Hadi			EEG-based single-channel authentication systems with optimum electrode placement for different mental activities	BIOMEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Authentication; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Biometric; Single-channel; Signal processing; Security	PERSON AUTHENTICATION	Background: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of a brain contain a unique pattern for each person and the potential for biometric applications. Authentication and security is a very important issue in our life and brainwave-based authentication is an addition to biometric authentication systems, which has many advantages over others. In this paper, we study the performance of a single channel brainwave-based authentication systems and select optimum channels based on mental activities. Methods: In this study, we used a dataset with five mental activities with seven subjects (325 samples). The EEG based authentication system includes three pre-processing steps, feature extraction, and classification. Features for Subject Authentication, are obtained from discrete Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform, autoregressive modeling, and entropy features. Then these features are classified using the Neural Network, Bayesian network and Support Vector Machine. Results: We achieved accuracy in the range of 97-98% mean accuracy with Neural Network classifier for single-channel authentication system with optimum electrode placement for mental activity. We also analyzed the authentication system independently from the type of mental activity and chose channel O-2 as the optimum channel with an accuracy of 95%. Conclusions: Channel optimization can obtain higher performance by reducing the number of EEG channels and defined the optimum electrode placement for different mental activities.

In this work, a method based on sparse kernel machines is proposed for the discrimination of Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials responses. More specifically, a new kernel based on Partial Least Squares is introduced to describe the similarities between EEG trials, while the estimation of regression weights is performed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning framework. The experimental results obtained on two benchmarking datasets, have shown that the proposed method provides significantly better performance compared to state of the art approaches of the related literature.

Behaviourally, humans solve this problem near-optimally as predicted by Bayesian causal inference; but the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Combining Bayesian modelling, electroencephalography (EEG), and multivariate decoding in an audiovisual spatial localisation task, we show that the brain accomplishes Bayesian causal inference by dynamically encoding multiple spatial estimates. Initially, auditory and visual signal locations are estimated independently; next, an estimate is formed that combines information from vision and audition. Yet, it is only from 200 ms onwards that the brain integrates audiovisual signals weighted by their bottom-up sensory reliabilities and top-down task relevance into spatial priority maps that guide behavioural responses. As predicted by Bayesian causal inference, these spatial priority maps take into account the brain's uncertainty about the world's causal structure and flexibly arbitrate between sensory integration and segregation. The dynamic evolution of perceptual estimates thus reflects the hierarchical nature of Bayesian causal inference, a statistical computation, which is crucial for effective interactions with the environment.

Classification Performance of SSVEP Brain-Computer Interfaces Based on Functional Connectivity	XXVI BRAZILIAN CONGRESS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, CBEB 2018, VOL. 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	26th Brazilian Congress on Biomedical Engineering (CBEB)	OCT 21-25, 2018	Armacao de Buzios, BRAZIL	Equipacare, Senfio, Brazilian Soc Biomed Engn		Brain-computer interfaces; SSVEP; Electroencephalography; Functional connectivity; Complex networks	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; NETWORKS	Brain connectivity analysis via complex networks has been widely applied to elucidate functional aspects related to brain diseases, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson, and, more recently, to investigations concerning the functional organization of brain regions under motor imagery in brain computer interfaces (BCIs). Therefore, this work seeks to investigate the classification performance of steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) brain-computer interfaces based on functional connectivity. Two different approaches were chosen for extracting functional connectivity and estimating the adjacency matrix from SSVEP-EEG signals: classical Pearson correlation and a new proposal based on Space-Time recurrence counting. These strategies were followed by graph feature evaluation (clustering coefficient, degree, betweenness and eigenvalue centralities), feature selection via Davies-Bouldin index and classification using a least squares classifier for 15 subjects in a 4-command SSVEP-BCI system. For comparison, we also employed a classical spectral feature extraction approach based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). It was observed that it is possible to separate the classes with a mean accuracy of 0.56 for Pearson and 0.61 for the STR framework, with the clustering coefficient and the eigenvector centrality being the best attributes for these scenarios, respectively. Nonetheless, classical FFT-based feature extraction obtained the best decoding performance.

These signals also exhibit highly non-stationary characteristics and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As a result, there is often poor task detection accuracy and high error rates in designed brain-computer interfacing (BCI) systems. In this paper, a novel preprocessing method is proposed to automatically reconstruct the EEG signal by selecting the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on a median frequency measure. Multivariate empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose the EEC signals into a set of IMFs. The reconstructed EEG signal has high SNR and contains only information correlated to a specific motor imagery task. The common spatial pattern is used to extract features from the reconstructed EEC signals. The linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine have been utilized in order to classify the features into left hand motor imagery and right hand motor imagery tasks. Our experimental results on the BCI competition IV dataset 2A show that the proposed method with fifteen channels outperforms bandpass filtering with 22 channels (> 1%) and by > 9 % (p = 0.0078) with raw EEG signals, > 13% (p = 0.0039) with empirical mode decomposition-based filtering and > 17 % ( p = 0.0039) with discrete wavelet transform-based filtering.

Self-paced movement intention recognition from EEG signals during upper limb robot-assisted rehabilitation	2019 9TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE/EMBS International Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAR 20-23, 2019	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, EMBS				Currently, one of the challenges in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for neurorehabilitation is the recognition of the intention to perform different movements from same limb. This would allow finer control of neurorehabilitation and motor recovery devices by end-users [1]. To address this issue, we assess the feasibility of recognizing two self-paced movement intentions of the right upper limb plus a rest state from EEG signals recorded during robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy. In addition, the work proposes the use of Multi-CSP features and deep learning classifiers to recognize movement intentions of the same limb. The results showed performance peaked greater at (80%) using a novel classification models implemented in a multiclass classification scenario. On the basis of these results, the decoding of the movement intention could potentially be used to develop more natural and intuitive robot assisted neurorehabilitation therapies.

However, subjective fatigue of the presented codes has been a problem. In this study, we introduce chaotic codes containing broadband spectrum and similar correlation property. We examined whether the introduced chaotic codes could be decoded from EEG signals and also compared the subjective fatigue level with m-sequence codes in normal subjects. We generated chaotic code from one-dimensional logistic map and used it with conventional 31-bit m-sequence code. In a c-VEP based study in normal subjects (n = 44, 21 females) we presented these codes visually and recorded EEG signals from the corresponding codes for their four lagged versions. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and spatiotemporal beamforming (STB) methods were used for target identification and comparison of responses. Additionally, we compared the subjective self-declared fatigue using VAS caused by presented m-sequence and chaotic codes. The introduced chaotic code was decoded from EEG responses with CCA and STB methods. The maximum total accuracy values of 93.6 +/- 11.9% and 94 +/- 14.4% were achieved with STB method for chaotic and m-sequence codes for all subjects respectively. The achieved accuracies in all subjects were not significantly different in m-sequence and chaotic codes. There was significant reduction in subjective fatigue caused by chaotic codes compared to the m-sequence codes. Both m-sequence and chaotic codes were similar in their accuracies as evaluated by CCA and STB methods. The chaotic codes significantly reduced subjective fatigue compared to the m-sequence codes.

This is an adaptive strategy because it can increase the quality of a decision, and previous behavioral work has shown that decision-makers engage in such confidence-driven information-seeking. The present study aimed to characterize the neural markers that mediate the relationship between confidence and information-seeking. A paradigm was used in which 17 human participants (9 male) made an initial perceptual decision, and then decided whether or not they wanted to sample more evidence before committing to a final decision and confidence judgment. Predecisional and postdecisional event-related potential components were similarly modulated by the level of confidence and by information-seeking choices. Time-resolved multivariate decoding of scalp EEG signals first revealed that both information-seeking choices and decision confidence could be decoded from the time of the initial decision to the time of the subsequent information-seeking choice (within-condition decoding). Noabove-chance decoding was visible in the preresponse time window. Crucially, a classifier trained to decode high versus low confidence predicted information-seeking choices after the initial perceptual decision (across-condition decoding). This time window corresponds to that of a postdecisional neural marker of confidence. Collectively, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that neural indices of confidence are functionally involved in information-seeking decisions.

A Personalized Reading Coach using Wearable EEG Sensors A Pilot Study of Brainwave Learning Analytics	CSEDU: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED EDUCATION - VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Computer Supported Education (CSEDU)	MAR 15-17, 2018	Funchal, PORTUGAL			Education/Learning; Quantitative Methods; Prototyping; Implementation; Machine Learning; Personalization Sensors; Desktop/Laptop Computers; Wearable Computers; Behavior Change; Personal Data/Tracking; Schools/Educational Setting		The advent of wearable consumer-grade brainwave sensors opens the possibility of building educational technology that can provide reliable feedback about the focus and attention of a student who is engaged in a learning activity. In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of developing a simple web-based application that exploits EEG data to monitor reading effectiveness personalized for individual readers. Our tool uses a variant of k-means classification on the relative power of the five standard bands (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta) for each of four electrodes on the Muse wearable brainwave sensor. We demonstrate that after 30 minutes of training, our relatively simple approach is able to successfully distinguish between brain signals produced when the subject engages in reading versus when they are relaxing. The accuracy of classification varied across the 10 subjects from 55% to 85% with a mean of 71%. The standard approach to recognize relaxation is to look for strong alpha and/or theta signals and it is reasonably effective but is most associated with closed eye relaxation and it does not allow for personalization. Our k-means classification approach provides a personalized classifier which distinguishes open eye relaxation from reading and has the potential to detect a wide variety of different cognitive states.

Covariance matrices are commonly used to estimate the difference between subjects. However, the classification performances vary greatly depending on different assumptions of the distribution of covariance matrices. Therefore, to directly observe the variations of the target subject's features after transferring, we neglect the distribution of covariance matrices and instead compare cosine similarities of spatial filters between the target subject and the composite subject whose data comes from the target subject and a source subject. Two RCSP algorithms based on cosine measure are proposed to use the samples of all source subjects and most useful source subjects, respectively. Experiments on one public data set from BCI competition show that our proposed approaches significantly improve the classification performances compared to the conventional CSP algorithm in almost every case, based on a small training set.

The extent of conscious perception of a stimulus is often probed by asking subjects to provide confidence estimations in their choices in challenging perceptual decision-making tasks. Here, we aimed to dissociate neural patterns of "cognitive" and "sensory" information maintenance by linking category selective visual processes to decision confidence using multivariate decoding techniques on human EEG data. Participants discriminated at-threshold masked face versus house stimuli and reported confidence in their discrimination performance. Three distinct types of category-selective neural activity patterns were observed, dissociable by their timing, scalp topography, relationship with decision confidence, and generalization profile. An early (similar to 150-200 ms) decoding profile was unrelated to confidence and quickly followed by two distinct decodable patterns of late neural activity (350-500 ms). One pattern was on-diagonal, global and highly related to decision confidence, likely indicating cognitive maintenance of consciously reportable stimulus representations. The other pattern however was off-diagonal, restricted to posterior electrode sites (local), and independent of decision confidence, and therefore may reflect sensory maintenance of category-specific information, possibly operating via recurrent processes within visual cortices. These results highlight that two functionally independent neural processes are operating in parallel, only one of which is related to decision confidence and conscious access.

Many studies focused on accuracy on one subject while subject-independent performance evaluation was still unclear. In this paper, the objective is to create an emotion recognition model that can be applied to multiple subjects. By adopting convolutional neural networks (CNNs), advantage could be gained from utilizing information from electrodes and time steps. Using CNNs also does not need feature extraction which might leave out other related but unobserved features. CNNs with three to seven convolutional layers were deployed in this research. We measured their performance with a binary classification task for compositions of emotions including arousal and valence. The results showed that our method captured EEG signal patterns from numerous subjects by 10-fold cross validation with 81.54% and 86.87% accuracy from arousal and valence respectively. The method also showed a higher capability of generalization to unseen subjects than the previous method as can be observed from the results of leave-one-subject-out validation.

The application of Deep Neural Networks to detect levels of Anesthesia from Electroencephalogram (EEG) is relatively new field and has not been addressed extensively in current researches as done with other fields. The peculiarities of the study emerges from not using any type of pre-processing at all which is usually done to the EEG signal in order to filter it or have it in better shape, but rather accept the signal in its raw nature. This could make the study a peculiar, especially with using new development tool that seldom has been used in deep learning which is the DeepLEarning4J (DL4J), the java programming environment platform made easy and tailored for deep neural network learning purposes. Results up to 97% in detecting two levels of Anesthesia have been reported successfully.

Online asynchronous decoding of error-related potentials during the continuous control of a robot	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION; ERP; BCI	Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are the neural signature of error processing. Therefore, the detection of ErrPs is an intuitive approach to improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The incorporation of ErrPs in discrete BCIs is well established but the study of asynchronous detection of ErrPs is still in its early stages. Here we show the feasibility of asynchronously decoding ErrPs in an online scenario. For that, we measured EEG in 15 participants while they controlled a robotic arm towards a target using their right hand. In 30% of the trials, the control of the robotic arm was halted at an unexpected moment (error onset) in order to trigger error-related potentials. When an ErrP was detected after the error onset, participants regained the control of the robot and could finish the trial. Regarding the asynchronous classification in the online scenario, we obtained an average true positive rate (TPR) of 70% and an average true negative rate (TNR) of 86.8%. These results indicate that the online asynchronous decoding of ErrPs was, on average, reliable, showing the feasibility of the asynchronous decoding of ErrPs in an online scenario.

However, the deep learning approaches to distinguish stress levels based on the changes in hemoglobin concentrations have not yet been extensively investigated. In this paper, we evaluated the efficiencies of advanced methods differentiating the rest and task periods during Stroop task experiments. We first explored that the apparent changes of oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations associated with two mental stages did exist across each participant. The preprocessing steps, such as converting raw signals into hemoglobin values and filtering to remove various noises involved in fNIRS signals, were performed to obtain the clean dataset, called non-PCA inputs. Next, we applied the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm to get PCA-inputs before putting non-PCA inputs into our four classifiers. Then, a novel deep learning-based discrimination framework was studied.

Together with machine-learning methods, prediction models have proved to be valuable for baseline prediction. Purpose To propose an ensemble learning modeling framework that integrates imaging and genetic information for individualized baseline prediction of early-stage treatment response of antidepressants in major depressive disorder (MDD). Study Type Prospective. Subjects In all, 98 inpatients with MDD. Field Strength/Sequence 3.0T MRI and gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. Assessment Participants were divided into responders and nonresponders based on reducing rates of HDRS-6 after early-stage treatment of 2 weeks. Fourteen brain regions of interest were selected according to previous studies. An ensemble learning modeling framework was used to integrate imaging data and genetic data. Statistical Tests Support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel was utilized to integrate multimode information and then to construct the prediction model. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the performance. The position characteristics obtained through SVM-RFE (recursive feature elimination) algorithm and LOOCV was considered to compare each feature's relative importance for the prediction model. Results Compared with the single-level prediction model, the ensemble learning prediction model showed improvement in prediction performance (accuracy from 0.61 to 0.86 with imaging data and genetic data). Integrated with 14 priori brain regions, the region of interest (ROI) map ensemble learning prediction model can achieve a performance that is analogous with the model with information from whole-brain regions (both with accuracy of 0.81). The integration of genetic features further improved the sensitivity of prediction (sensitivity from 0.78 to 0.87 under the ensemble learning framework). Data Conclusion Our ensemble learning prediction model demonstrated significant advantages in interpretability and information integration. The findings may provide more assistance for clinical treatment selection in MDD at the individual level. Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019.

This technology opens promising perspectives to monitor the "brain at work" in complex real-life situations such as while operating aircraft. However, there is a need to benchmark these sensors in real operational conditions. We therefore designed a scenario in which twenty-two pilots equipped with a six-dry-electrode EEG system had to perform one low load and one high load traffic pattern along with a passive auditory oddball. In the low load condition, the participants were monitoring the flight handled by a flight instructor, whereas they were flying the aircraft in the high load condition. At the group level, statistical analyses disclosed higher P300 amplitude for the auditory target (Pz, P4 and Oz electrodes) along with higher alpha band power (Pz electrode), and higher theta band power (Oz electrode) in the low load condition as compared to the high load one. Single trial classification accuracy using both event-related potentials and event-related frequency features at the same time did not exceed chance level to discriminate the two load conditions. However, when considering only the frequency features computed over the continuous signal, classification accuracy reached around 70% on average. This study demonstrates the potential of dry-EEG to monitor cognition in a highly ecological and noisy environment, but also reveals that hardware improvement is still needed before it can be used for everyday flight operations.

Multimodal wrist-worn devices for seizure detection and advancing research: Focus on the Empatica wristbands	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epilepsy; Convulsive seizures; Wearable device; SUDEP; Electrodermal activity; Machine learning	TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES; ACCELEROMETER	Wearable automated seizure detection devices offer a high potential to improve seizure management, through continuous ambulatory monitoring, accurate seizure counts, and real-time alerts for prompt intervention. More importantly, these devices can be a life-saving help for people with a higher risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), especially in case of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The Embrace and E4 wristbands (Empatica) are the first commercially available multimodal wristbands that were designed to sense the physiological hallmarks of ongoing GTCS: while Embrace only embeds a machine learning-based detection algorithm, both E4 and Embrace devices are equipped with motion (accelerometers, ACC) and electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors and both the devices received medical clearance (E4 from EU CE, Embrace from EU CE and US FDA). The aim of this contribution is to provide updated evidence of the effectiveness of GTCS detection and monitoring relying on the combination of ACM and EDA sensors. A machine learning algorithm able to recognize ACC and EDA signatures of GTCS-like events has been developed on E4 data, labeled using gold-standard video-EEG examined by epileptologists in clinical centers, and has undergone continuous improvement. While keeping an elevated sensitivity to GTCS (92-100%), algorithm improvements and growing data availability led to lower false alarm rate (FAR) from the initial (similar to)2 down to 0.2-1 false alarms per day, as showed by retrospective and prospective analyses in inpatient settings. Algorithm adjustment to better discriminate real-life physical activities from GTCS, has brought the initial FAR of (similar to)6 on outpatient real life settings, down to values comparable to best-case clinical settings (FAR < 0.5), with comparable sensitivity. Moreover, using multimodal sensing, it has been possible not only to detect GTCS but also to quantify seizure-induced autonomic dysfunction, based on automatic features of abnormal motion and EDA. The latter biosignal correlates with the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression, a biomarker observed in 100% of monitored SUDEP cases.

Due to the increasing level of integration/collaboration between humans and automation in these tasks, the operational performance of closed-loop human-machine systems can be enhanced when the machine monitors the operator's cognitive states and adapts to them in order to maximise the effectiveness of the Human-Machine Interfaces and Interactions (HMI2). Technological developments have led to neurophysiological observations becoming a reliable methodology to evaluate the human operator's states using a variety of wearable and remote sensors. The adoption of sensor networks can be seen as an evolution of this approach, as there are notable advantages if these sensors collect and exchange data in real-time, while their operation is controlled remotely and synchronised. This paper discusses recent advances in sensor networks for aerospace cyber-physical systems, focusing on Cognitive HMI2 (CHMI2) implementations. The key neurophysiological measurements used in this context and their relationship with the operator's cognitive states are discussed. Suitable data analysis techniques based on machine learning and statistical inference are also presented, as these techniques allow processing both neurophysiological and operational data to obtain accurate cognitive state estimations. Lastly, to support the development of sensor networks for CHMI2 applications, the paper addresses the performance characterisation of various state-of-the-art sensors and the propagation of measurement uncertainties through a machine learning-based inference engine. Results show that a proper sensor selection and integration can support the implementation of effective human-machine systems for various challenging aerospace applications, including Air Traffic Management (ATM), commercial airliner Single-Pilot Operations (SIPO), one-to-many Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and space operations management.

J	Zhang, HH; Deng, ZC; Liu, S				Zhang, Honghui; Deng, Zichen; Liu, Shuang			Transition Dynamics of Generalized Periodic Discharges Observed in EEG Waveforms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Article						Generalized periodic discharge (GPD); epileptiform; mean field model; transition dynamics	CRITICALLY-ILL; PATTERNS; NETWORKS; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION	Generalized periodic discharges (GPD) are generalized waveforms that recur with a relatively uniform morphology and duration observed in EEG recordings of many types of metabolic encephalopathy, which are often referred to as epileptiform. In this paper, we try to link these spatiotemporal electrocortical activities and significant attributes of cortex based on Liley's mean field model, and seek possible generation mechanisms of GPD rhythms from several factors. To these ends, the dynamical properties of simulated EEG consistent with neurophysiological features of human cortex are investigated, among which GPD patterns are our focus. Firstly, with different value sets of model parameters, we reproduce some typical simulation waveforms which are analogous to mammalian normal or abnormal brain activities detected by EEG. Or in other words, we put more emphasis on brain waveforms of GPD states, normal states, and low firing rate states in our numerical simulations, and mode transitions among different firing states are our main interests. Secondly, through analysis of maximum Lyapunov exponents and frequency spectrum, we give several mode transitions by varying synaptic connections between excitatory and inhibitory populations, which support the conjecture that selective changes of synaptic connections can trigger GPD states, such as in excitatory (AMPA receptors) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA receptors). Thirdly, we stress the importance of time delay on neural population connections and find that they are free to transfer among different firing modes with appropriate time delays. Furthermore, considering the effects of external inputs to cerebral cortex, we verify that stimulation can lead to good controls on GPD patterns, including facilitation and elimination. Finally, we show that more dynamical rhythms can be produced when taking into account the cortico-cortical connections. These modeling results are expected to shed light into the pathophysiological mechanisms of GPD modes from a theoretical viewpoint.

Improving Performance of Devanagari Script Input-Based P300 Speller Using Deep Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Devanagari script (DS); stacked autoencoder (SAE); deep convolution neural network (DCNN); P300 speller	SIGNAL	The performance of an existing Devanagari script (DS) input-based P300 speller with conventional machine learning techniques suffers from low information transfer rate (ITR). This occurs due to its required large size of display, i.e., 8 x 8 row-column (RC) paradigm which exhibits issues like crowding effect, adjacency, fatigue, task difficulty, and required large number of trials for character recognition. For P300 detection, deep learning algorithms have shown the state of art performance compared to the conventional machine learning algorithms in the recent past. Therefore, authors have been motivated to develop a deep learning architecture for DS-based P300 speller which can detect the target characters more accurately and in less number of trials. For this, two proven deep learning algorithms, stacked autoencoder (SAE) and deep convolution neural network (DCNN) have been adopted. For further bettering their performances, batch normalization and innovative double batch training is included here to achieve accelerated training and alleviate the problem of overfitting. Additionally, a leaky ReLU activation function has also been used in DCNN to overcome dying ReLU problem. The experiments have been performed on self-generated dataset of 20 Devanagari words with 79 characters acquired from 10 subjects using 16 channel actiCAP Xpress EEG recorder. The experimental results illustrated that the proposed DCNN is able to detect 88.22% correct targets in just three trials. Moreover, it also provides ITR of 20.58 bits per minutes, which is significantly higher than existing techniques.	[Kshirsagar, G. B.; Londhe, N.

Methods We included 123 consecutive patients who had SCSs and CSs during scalp-VEEG evaluation. All patients had subsequent epilepsy surgery and at least 1-year follow-up. Concordance between SCSs and CSs was summarized into five categories: complete, partial, overlapping, no concordance, or indeterminate. Using the same scheme, we analyzed the relationship between resection and SCS/CS localizations. The concordance measures, along with demographic, electroclinical, and other presurgical evaluation data, were evaluated for their associations with postoperative seizure outcome. Results Sixty-nine patients (56.1%) had seizure-free outcome at 1-year follow-up. In 68 patients (55.3%), the localizations of SCSs and CSs were completely concordant. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that complete SCS/CS concordance was independently associated with seizure-free outcome at 1-year (P = .020) and 2-year follow-up (P = .040). In the temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) seizure-free group, SCS localization was completely contained within the resection in 44.4% and CS localization was completely contained within the resection in 41.7%; in the extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE) seizure-free group, SCS localization was completely contained within the resection in 54.5% and CS localization was completely contained within the resection in 57.6%. Significance Complete concordance between CS and SCS localization is a positive prognostic factor for 1-year and 2-year postoperative seizure-free outcome. Localization value of SCSs on scalp VEEG is similar to that of CSs for TLE and ETLE. Although SCSs cannot replace CSs, localization information from SCSs should not be ignored.

Due to the high correlation between emotion and involuntary physiological changes, physiological signals are a prime candidate for emotion analysis. However, due to the need of a huge amount of training data for a high-quality machine learning model, computational complexity becomes a major bottleneck. To overcome this issue, brain-inspired hyperdimensional (HD) computing, an energy-efficient and fast learning computational paradigm, has a high potential to achieve a balance between accuracy and the amount of necessary training data. We propose an HD Computing-based Multimodality Emotion Recognition ( HDC-MER). HDC-MER maps real-valued features to binary HD vectors using a random nonlinear function, and further encodes them over time, and fuses across different modalities including GSR, ECG, and EEG. The experimental results show that, compared to the best method using the full training data, HDC- MER achieves higher classification accuracy for both valence (83.2% vs. 80.1%) and arousal (70.1% vs. 68.4%) using only 1/4 training data. HDC-MER also achieves at least 5% higher averaged accuracy compared to all the other methods in any point along the learning curve.

Valdes			An Age-Adjusted EEG Source Classifier Accurately Detects School-Aged Barbadian Children That Had Protein Energy Malnutrition in the First Year of Life	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						protein energy malnutrition PEM; children; EEG; source analysis; classifiers	BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; QUANTITATIVE EEG; WHITE-MATTER; REGULARIZATION; TOMOGRAPHY; NEWBORNS; MODEL	We have identified an electroencephalographic (EEG) based statistical classifier that correctly distinguishes children with histories of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) in the first year of life from healthy controls with 0.82% accuracy (area under the ROC curve). Our previous study achieved similar accuracy but was based on scalp quantitative EEG features that precluded anatomical interpretation. We have now employed BC-VARETA, a novel high-resolution EEG source imaging method with minimal leakage and maximal sparseness, which allowed us to identify a classifier in the source space. The EEGs were recorded in 1978 in a sample of 108 children who were 5-11 years old and were participants in the 45+ year longitudinal Barbados Nutrition Study. The PEM cohort experienced moderate-severe PEM limited to the first year of life and were age, handedness and gender-matched with healthy classmates who served as controls. In the current study, we utilized a machine learning approach based on the elastic net to create a stable sparse classifier. Interestingly, the classifier was driven predominantly by nutrition group differences in alpha activity in the lingual gyrus. This structure is part of the pathway associated with generating alpha rhythms that increase with normal maturation. Our findings indicate that the PEM group showed a significant decrease in alpha activity, suggestive of a delay in brain development. Childhood malnutrition is still a serious worldwide public health problem and its consequences are particularly severe when present during early life. Deficits during this critical period are permanent and predict impaired cognitive and behavioral functioning later in life. Our EEG source classifier may provide a functionally interpretable diagnostic technology to study the effects of early childhood malnutrition on the brain, and may have far-reaching applicability in low resource settings.

However, only a portion of the proprietary algorithm has been identified. We investigated the BIS algorithm using clinical big data and machine learning techniques. Retrospective data from 5,427 patients who underwent BIS monitoring during general anaesthesia were used, of which 80% and 20% were used as training datasets and test datasets, respectively. A histogram of data points was plotted to define five BIS ranges representing the depth of anaesthesia. Decision tree analysis was performed to determine the electroencephalography subparameters and their thresholds for classifying five BIS ranges. Random sample consensus regression analyses were performed using the subparameters to derive multiple linear regression models of BIS calculation in five BIS ranges. The performance of the decision tree and regression models was externally validated with positive predictive value and median absolute error, respectively. A four-level depth decision tree was built with four subparameters such as burst suppression ratio, power of electromyogram, 95% spectral edge frequency, and relative beta ratio. Positive predictive values were 100%, 80%, 80%, 85% and 89% in the order of increasing BIS in the five BIS ranges. The average of median absolute errors of regression models was 4.1 as BIS value. A data driven BIS calculation algorithm using multiple electroencephalography subparameters with different weights depending on BIS ranges has been proposed. The results may help the anaesthesiologists interpret the erroneous BIS values observed during clinical practice.

Motor imagery classification has recently been a center of research interest in the BCI-based rehabilitation. As of current, spatial features and spectral features were often used independently for motor imagery classification. While few studies attempted to combine the information from varying domains including spectral, spatial and temporal feature, the attempts employed simplistic linear models. In this study, a novel feature extraction method for including spatial and temporal information is proposed. The method uses recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) which excels in temporal and spatial classification. The method was tested for classifying wrist twisting-related task classification during manipulation of robotic arm via electroencephalography, and the performance of the method was compared to the conventional motor imagery classifiers with common spatial pattern (CSP) filter. The proposed method showed 73.9% accuracy in the classification of three types of tasks, whereas the highest accuracy achieved by conventional models was 59.5%. Overall, the performance of the proposed RCNN model was greater than the conventional models using the CSP as input features. The findings warrant further application of the proposed methods in varying BCI environment.

Feature selection not only finds the best informative features, but also helps in reducing the overall dimensions of the given dataset. In this paper, the actual feature-set is obtained from Brain Computer Interface (BCI) Competition-II Dataset-III motor-imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signal using the Adaptive Auto-regressive (AAR) feature extraction technique. Based on the order (number of AR coefficients) of the AAR algorithm, two variants of datasets have been generated: 12 (order = 6 per electrode) and 24 (order = 12 per electrode) AAR features datasets. Here, a new fuzzified version of discernibility matrix has been proposed to determine a subset of features, which provides the best classification accuracy. In order to find the best feature subset, various types of dissimilarity measures have been used and compared with one another in our proposed fuzzy discernibility matrix (FDM) based feature selection technique. We have implemented the proposed algorithm on the given datasets using both the holdout technique as well as the 10-fold cross-validation in our study. The performances of the selected featuresubsets are evaluated based on accuracies using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Ensemble variants of classifiers. The empirical results obtained from our experiments in this paper is competitive in terms of accuracy and outperformed the other popular t-test, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), Bhattacharyya distance and Gini index based feature selection techniques. Our proposed FDM based feature selection algorithm using holdout technique provides 80% and 78.57% accuracies for the 12 and 24 features AAR datasets respectively. The results obtained in the holdout technique with only 50% of the best discriminant features are even better than the performances obtained while using the original feature-sets (without using any feature selection technique). Again, it gives 78.57% and 75.57% mean-accuracies from 5 x 10-fold cross-validations using only 6 and 12 most discriminant AAR features from the actual 12&24 features-sets respectively.

We present a custom portable EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that exploits Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) induced with an oddball experimental paradigm to control the infotainment menu of a car. A preliminary evaluation of the system was performed on 10 participants in a standard laboratory setting and while driving on a closed private track. The task consisted of repeated presentations of 6 different menu icons in oddball fashion. Subject-specific models were trained with different machine learning approaches on cerebral data from either only laboratory or driving experiments (in-lab and in-car models) or a combination of the two (hybrid model) to classify EEG responses to target and non-target stimuli. All models were tested on the subjects' last in-car sessions that were not used for the training. Analysis of ERPs amplitude showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences between the EEG responses associated with target and non-target icons, both in the laboratory and while driving. Classification Accuracy (CA) was above chance level for all subjects in all training configurations, with a deep CNN trained on the hybrid set achieving the highest scores (mean CA = 53 +/- 12 %, with 16 % chance level for the 6-class discrimination). The ranking of the features importance provided by a classical BCI approach suggests an ERP-based discrimination between target and non-target responses. No statistical differences were observed between the CAs for the in-lab and in-car training sets, nor between the EEG responses in these conditions, indicating that the data collected in the standard laboratory setting could be readily used for a real driving application without a noticeable decrease in performance. However, refining the model with real-world data might be beneficial. While there is still room for improvement, the results demonstrate the feasibility of a brain-based control of the car infotainment while driving.

In traditional approaches, methods in pattern recognition field are adopted to solve these problems. Nowadays, the deep learning theory has developed so fast that researchers have employed it in many areas like computer vision and speech recognition, which have achieved remarkable results. However, few people introduce the deep learning method into the study of biomedical signals, especially EEG signals. In this paper, a wavelet transform-based input, which combines the time-frequency images of C3, Cz, and C4 channels, is proposed to extract the feature of motor imagery EEG signal. Then, a 2-Layer convolutional neural network is built as the classifier and convolutional kernels of different sizes are validated. The performance obtained by the proposed approach is evaluated by accuracy and Kappa value. The accuracy on dataset III from BCI competition II reaches 90%, and the best Kappa value on dataset 2a from competition IV is greater than many of other methods. In addition, the proposed method utilizes a resized small input, which reduces calculation complexity, so the training period is relatively faster. The results show that the method using convolutional neural network can be comparable or better than the other state-of-the-art approaches, and the performance will be improved when there is sufficient data.

However, the selection of an appropriate method can be challenging and may depend on the type of data as well. In order to elaborate on this point, this manuscript investigates the impact of preprocessing on single-trial ERP detection. Method: This manuscript has investigated three scenarios for preprocessing ERP data: (1) ERP analysis without any preprocessing; (2) ERP analysis involving the amplitude-based artifact rejection method; (3) ERP analysis based on a combination of the amplitude-based artifact rejection and wavelet-enhanced independent component analysis (wICA) methods. In particular, the comparison of these preprocessing methods was based on a common machine learning (ML) framework. Therefore, the three different preprocessing methods could be compared. Also, three different classifiers (i.e., logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM)) were compared as well. In addition, the performance metrics utilized for this purpose were the single-trials classification recognition, precision and recall. The proposed ML framework involved the general sub-blocks of feature extraction, feature selection, classification and validation (10-fold cross-validation). The proposed ML framework was aimed to classify the single trials event-related potentials (ERPs) such as P300 (target) vs non-P300 (non-target). Results: The maximum classification accuracy was achieved for scenario 3 as described above, i.e., the combination of amplitude-based artifact rejection and wICA methods. More specifically, the classification results were as follows: recognition = 0.77, recall = 0.77, and precision = 0.99. Conclusion: The choice of an EEG preprocessing method has a significant impact on the subsequent analysis.

Sudden deafness is generally defined as sensorineural hearing loss of 30 dB or greater over at least three contiguous audiometric frequencies and within a three-day period, which is usually unilateral and can be associated with tinnitus. The exact pathogenesis of such auditory diseases is still unknown, and alterations in the functional connectivity of the brain network are suspected to involve one possible pathogenesis. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is a common approach to capture brain neural activity. This paper conducts a twofold study in terms of brain network analysis for auditory diseases based on EEG data. Specifically, the brain network is constructed in view of the phase lag index (PLI) between signals. The unsupervised study is first conducted via the unsupervised network community detection algorithm. The goal is to reveal the underlying characteristics of functional connectivity concerning subjects with and without auditory diseases from the brain network perspective. The second study is the supervised learning. A new strategy termed FBA (Features from Brain Areas) is proposed to abstract each brain network as a feature vector and the supervised classification method, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized to perform the three-class classification concerning the regular control group, tinnitus patient group and sudden deafness patient group. Extensive experiments have been conducted on totally 146 subjects including 41 regular controls, 51 sudden deafness patients and 54 tinnitus patients. The results show the necessary of the unsupervised study that may shed light on the pathogenesis and the classification performed in the supervised study may serve as a portable detection method for auditory diseases.

Using conjugate Bayesian framework improves the computation efficiency. Multiple kernels instead of a single kernel avoid the kernel selection problem which is also a computationally expensive work. Through grouping parameter learning, BMKGL can simultaneously integrate information from different dimensions and find the dimensions which contribute more to the variations of the outcome for the purpose of interpretable property. Meanwhile, BMKGL can select the most suitable combination of kernels for different dimensions so as to extract the most appropriate measure for each dimension and improve the accuracy of classification results. The simulation results illustrate that our learning process has better performance in prediction results and stability compared to some popular classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbours algorithm, support vector machine algorithm and naive Bayes classifier. BMKGL also outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy and interpretation for the heart disease and EEG datasets.

However, the current method needed time for recording training data. The time can be saved by the subject-to-subject transfer learning. However, the suitable classifier for the learning remains unknown. As a first step, this study compared the classifiers for the transfer learning of the BCI. They were evaluated on the dataset of a five-class affective auditory P300-based BCI. EEG data from sixteen subjects were assigned for the training, then data from the other six subjects were used for the testing. Classifiers such as the linear support-vector machine (SVM lin.), the kernel SVM (SVM RBF), the quadratic discriminant analysis were applied and compared. As a result, the SVM lin. and the SVM RBF were suitable for this problem. The best mean classification accuracy was achieved by the SVM lin. (68.7%), and a subject showed 86% accuracy at best. These results suggest that some subjects can operate the BCI without recording his/her training data.

A key TDA method is persistent homology (PH), which summarizes the changes of connected components in a signal through a multiscale descriptor such as the persistent landscape (PL). A recent development indicates that statistical inference on PLs of scalp electroen-cephalographic (EEG) signals produces markers for localizing seizure foci. However, a key obstacle of applying PH to large-scale clinical EEGs is the ambiguity of performing statistical inference. To address this problem, we develop a unified permutation-based inference framework for testing statistical indifference in PLs of EEG signals before and during an epileptic seizure. Compared with the standard permutation test, the proposed framework is shown to have more robustness when signals undergo non-topological changes and more sensitivity when topological changes occur. Furthermore, the proposed new method drastically improves the average computation time by 15000 folds.

Nowadays, portable brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) using an HMD have been studied for the future of BMI interlocked with the present IoT technology. In order to investigate the feasibility of the top-down SSVEP (steady-state visual evoked potential) BMI embedded in an HMD, SSVEP stimuli was presented in a HoloLens (Microsoft) for augmented reality (AR) constructed by holography. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured during the top-down SSVEP-based BMI performance, where a grid-shaped flickering visual stimulus was presented in the display of HoloLens. We examined its feasibility in a real-time basis by its decoding accuracy. We found that the top-down SSVEP-BMI could be efficiently embedded in an AR-based HMD, and thus it can be applied for the AR-based device-control automation in an IoT space using EEG signals.

Supervised methods used to classify EEG signals have gotten satisfactory results. However, unlabeled samples are more frequent than labeled samples, so how to simultaneously utilize limited labeled samples and many unlabeled samples becomes a research hotspot. In this paper, we propose a new graph-based semi-supervised broad learning system (GSS-BLS), which combines the graph label propagation method to obtain pseudo-labels and then trains the GSS-BLS classifier together with other labeled samples. Three BCI competition datasets are used to assess the GSS-BLS approach and five comparison algorithms: BLS, ELM, HELM, LapSVM and SMIR. The experimental results show that GSS-BLS achieves satisfying Cohen's kappa values in three datasets. GSS-BLS achieves the better results of each subject in the 2-class and 4-class datasets and has significant improvements compared with original BLS except subject C6. Therefore, the proposed GSS-BLS is an effective semi-supervised algorithm for classifying EEG signals.

Ambulatory epileptic monitoring devices that can detect or even predict seizures play an important role for patients with intractable epilepsy. Though many EEG-based seizure detection algorithms have been proposed in the literature with high accuracy, their hardware implementations are constrained because of power consumption. Many commercial non-research EEG monitoring systems samples multiple electrodes at a relatively high rate and transmit the data either via a wire or wirelessly to an external signal processing unit. In this work, we studied how a reduced sampling precision affects the performance of our machine learning signal processing in seizure detection. To answer this question, we reduce the number of bits (precision) in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) used in an EEG recorder. The outcome shows that the reduction of ADC precision down to 6-bit does not significantly reduce our convolutional neural network performance in detecting seizure onsets. As an indication of the performance, we achieved an area under the curve (AUC) more than 92% and above 96% on Freiburg Hospital and the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT seizure datasets, respectively. A possible reduction in ADC precision not only contribute to energy consumption reduction, particularly if the data has to be transmitted, but also offers an improved computational efficacy regarding memory requirement and circuit area.

The concrete burden of neonatal seizures in neurodevelopmental outcome of term newborns is still unknown in literature. The aim of this study was to describe prognostic predictors in neonatal seizures. Subjects and methods. Observational prospective study of term neonates with clinical seizures from a tertiary center (2009-2018). Adverse outcome was determined as death, global developmental delay, cerebral palsy or epilepsy. Perinatal characteristics, etiology, electrographic features, neuroimaging and antiepileptic treatment were analyzed in a logistic regression model. Results. A total of 102 newborns were included (52 infants with normal outcome). Twelve fatalities were registered. In the survival group, 38 children had an adverse outcome (28 global developmental delay, 27 cerebral palsy, 21 epilepsy). From the prognostic variables identified in univariate analysis, perinatal complications, seizure onset in the first day of life, moderate to severe abnormal background activity, abnormal amplitude-integrated EEG pattern, and treatment response remained independently associated with adverse outcome after a logistic regression model. Conclusions. There is conflicting data about surrogate markers in neonatal seizures. Aside from confirming the predictive value of previously described variables, we observed that amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring is a forthcoming prognostic tool. Future approaches may include a wider use of amplitude-integrated EEG monitoring, being crucial for timely seizure identification and prompt treatment.

Methods In this manuscript, we reviewed literature concerning pediatric PNES and focused on those articles published in the last 10 years, in order to try to understand what the state of the art is at the moment, particularly as regards relationship and differential diagnosis with epilepsy. Results Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures have been extensively described in literature mainly in adults and less frequently in children. Despite the potential negative impact of a misdiagnosis (unnecessary investigations and antiepileptic drugs, structured pathological behavioral patterns), in literature there is little information regarding the real prevalence, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of PNES in children and adolescents. Conclusion Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are common but frequently missed entity in pediatric population. Diagnosis could be difficult, especially in those children who have both epileptic and nonepileptic seizures; video EEG and home video can help clinicians in diagnosis. More studies are needed to better classify PNES in children and facilitate diagnosis and treatment.

It is thus necessary for the feature extraction to improve the classification. The normal and poor dyslexic are found to activate similar areas on the left hemisphere during reading and writing. With only a single feature vector of beta activation, it is difficult to distinguish the difference between the two groups. Our work here aims to examine the classification performance of normal, poor and capable dyslexic with theta-beta band power ratio as an alternative feature vector. EEG signals were recorded from 33 subjects (11 normal, 11 poor and 11 capable dyslexics) during tasks of reading and writing words and non-words. 8 electrode locations (C3, C4, FC5, FC6, P3, P4, T7, T8) on the learning pathway and hypothesized compensatory pathway in capable dyslexic were applied. Theta and beta band power features were extracted using Daubechies, Symlets and Coiflets mother wavelet function with different orders. These are then served as inputs to linear and RBF kernel SVM classifier, where performance is measured by Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) graph. Result shows the highest average AUC is 0.8668 for linear SVM with features extracted from Symlets of order 2, while 0.9838 for RBF kernel SVM with features extracted from Daubechies of order 6. From boxplot, the normal subjects are found to have a lower theta-beta ratio of 2,5:1, as compared to that of poor and capable dyslexic, ranging between 3 to 5, for all the electrodes.

Recently, studies revealed that neural spatial and temporal patterns extracted from user-specific resting-state brain signals were closely related to those of his/her task data. In this study, we proposed a resting-state independent component analysis (RSICA) based spatial filtering algorithm aiming at extracting individual task-related spatial and temporal brain patterns from the resting-state data. Specifically, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to extract different independent components (ICs) from resting-state fNIRS data. The ICs with their spatial filter weights maximally lateralized over the sensorimotor regions were regarded as most relevant to motor imagery. These spatial filters were used to spatially filter the multi-channel motor imagery task data for feature extraction. Based on 8-minute resting-state data and a small training dataset (20 trials) from 10 participants, the proposed RSICA algorithm achieved an approximately 7% increase in left vs. right hand motor imagery classification accuracy, as compared to the conventional common spatial pattern (CSP)-based and shrinkage algorithms (69.8 +/- 12.1%, 63.3 +/- 10.3% and 63.4 +/- 11.8%, respectively). For acquiring a similar level of classification accuracy (i.e. 70%), the number of training data required could be reduced from 36 trials (CSP) to 22 trials (RSICA). As a relatively small training set is required to obtain a satisfactory performance, training burden is significantly reduced by RSICA, which might be useful for developing practical fNIRS-based motor imagery BCIs.

This study poses the question of how to continuously evaluate the quality of robotic behavior in a hybrid brain-computer interfacing (BCI) task, combining brain and non-brain signals, and how to use the collected information to adapt the robot's behavior accordingly. To this aim, we developed a rating system compatible with EEG recordings, requiring the users to execute only small movements with their thumb on a wireless controller to rate the robot's behavior on a continuous scale. The ratings were recorded together with dry EEG, respiration, ECG, and robotic joint angles in ROS. Pilot experiments were conducted with three users that had different levels of previous experience with robots. The results demonstrate the feasibility to obtain continuous rating data that give insight into the subjective user perception during direct human-robot interaction. The rating data suggests differences in subjective perception for users with no, moderate, or substantial previous robot experience. Furthermore, a variety of regression techniques, including deep CNNs, allowed us to predict the subjective ratings. Performance was better when using the position of the robotic hand than when using EEG, ECG, or respiration. A consistent advantage of features expected to be related to a motor bias could not be found. Across-user predictions showed that the models most likely learned a combination of general and individual features across-users. A transfer of pre-trained regressor to a new user was especially accurate in users with more experience. For future research, studies with more participants will be needed to evaluate the methodology for its use in practice.

Decoding covert speech for intuitive control of brain-computer interfaces based on single-trial EEG: a feasibility study	2019 IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REHABILITATION ROBOTICS (ICORR)	International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics ICORR		English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation Robotics (ICORR)	JUN 24-28, 2019	Toronto, CANADA	IEEE			COMMUNICATION; DEVICE	For individuals with severe motor deficiencies, controlling external devices such as robotic arms or wheelchairs can be challenging, as many devices require some degree of motor control to he operated, e.g. when controlled using a joystick. A brain-computer interface (BCI) relies only on signals from the brain and may be used as a controller instead of muscles. Motor imagery (MI) has been used in many studies as a control signal for BCIs. However, MI may not be suitable for all control purposes, and several people cannot obtain BCI control with MI. In this study, the aim was to investigate the feasibility of decoding covert speech from single-trial EEG and compare and combine it with Ml. In seven healthy subjects, EEG was recorded with twenty-five channels during six different actions: Speaking three words (both covert and overt speech), two arm movements (both motor imagery and execution), and one idle class. Temporal and spectral features were derived from the epochs and classified with a random forest classifier. The average classification accuracy was 67 +/- 9 % and 75 +/- 7 % for covert and overt speech, respectively; this was 5-10 % lower than the movement classification. The performance of the combined movement-speech decoder was 61 +/- 9 % and 67 +/- 7 % (covert and overt), but it is possible to have more classes available for control. The possibility of using covert speech for controlling a BCI was outlined; this is a step towards a multimodal BCI system for improved usability.	[Tottrup, L.; Leerskov, K.; Hadsund, J.

The method exploits electroencephalogram acquisitions (EEG), and specifically the Movement Related Potentials (MRPs) (i.e., and R rhythms), to actuate the user intention on the mechatronic device. The EEG data are collected by only five wireless smart electrodes positioned on the central and parietal cortex area. The acquired data are analyzed by an innovative single-trial classification algorithm that, with respect to the current state of the art, strongly reduces the training time (Minimum: h, reached: 10 min), as well as the acquisition time- after stimulus- for a reliable classification (Typical: 4-8 s reached: 2 s). As first step, the algorithm performs an EEG time-frequency analysis in the selected bands, making the data suitable for further computations. The implemented machine learning (ML) stage consists of: (i) dimensionality reduction; (ii) statistical inference-based features extraction (FE); (iii) classification model selection. It is also proposed a dedicated algorithm, the MLE-RIDE, for the dimensionality reduction that, jointly with statistical analyses, digitalize the and R rhythms, performing the features extraction. Finally, the best support vector machine (SVM) model is selected and used in the on-line classification. As proof of concept, two mechatronic devices have been brain-controlled by using the proposed BCI algorithm: a three-finger robotic hand and an acrylic prototype car. The experimental results, obtained with data from 3 subjects (aged 26 1), showed an accuracy on human will wireless detection of 87.4%, in the real-time binary discrimination, with 33.7ms of computation times.

This is a smarter, much more unbiased alternative to such business tools as email surveys, mystery shoppers or "rate the service" buttons - practices that tend to be subjective and inconsistent and often fail to produce accurate and meaningful data. Many kinds of research are conducted to detect the emotion of a person by using different formats of data like speech, text, gesture and facial expressions. The problem with this data is that it will vary depending on the origin, culture, and nation. Because of this, it is difficult to detect human emotions more accurately. To solve this, our research makes use of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that are directly collected from the brain. These signals not only ignore the external factors but also helps to detect real emotions arising from the brain. To conduct this research, a DEAP Dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals is used. Firstly, the raw signal data is processed by removing the noise and converting the time series signal to statistical data. This statistical data is used to perform binary classification of four emotions valence, arousal, dominance, and liking. Various classifying techniques are examined to find the model that provides the best classification accuracy on this data. The experimental results show that Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine are the best techniques for binary emotion classification with an accuracy of 69.25% and 70.35% respectively.

It is the nature of this short text that many pointers to research are given all of which show a high overlap to prior own contributions (this is not only unavoidable but intentional) or will touch upon ongoing unpublished respectively pre-published work. When analysing Brain Data, it is challenging to learn from small samples in high dimensional spaces. Often, for analysing EEG or for decoding cognitive states in imaging etc., data streams need to be combined stemming from various modalities (see e.g. Pfurtscheller et al 2010, Biessmann et al., 2011, Sui et al., 2012, Miiller-Putz et al. 2015, Fazli et al., 2012, 2015, Diihne et al., 2015, see also Waltz and Llinas, 1990 for a general reference) or non-stationarities need to be compensated in a robust manner (e.g. Biinau et al. 2009, Blankertz et al., 2008, 2011, 2016, Lemm et al., 2011, Samek et al. 2013, 2014, 2017a). The talk will discuss challenges when applying the (recently more and more popular) deep learning methods for BCI data and imaging data (e.g. Sturm et al. 2016, Shen et al 2017). Specifically, I will first briefly introduce the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) explanation framework for deep neural networks (Baehrens et al. 2010, Bach et al. 2015, Lapuschkin et al. 2016, Samek et al. 2017b, Montavon et al. 2017, 2018). Then its application to motor imagery BCI data is discussed (Sturm et al. 2016) and I will also report on an upcoming study (Thomas et al 2018) employing DL with explainable LSTMs (Arras et al 2017, for LSTM see Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) to large scale fMRI experimental data from (Van Essen et al 2013) This abstract is based on joint work with Armin Thomas, Wojciech Samek, Hauke Heekeren, Benjamin Blankertz, Gabriel Curio, Michael Tangermann, Siamac Fazli, Vadim Nikulin, Gregoire Montavon, Sebastian Bach/Lapuschkin, Irene Sturm, Arno Villringer, Carmen Vidaurre, Till Nierhaus and many other members of the Berlin Brain Computer Interface team, the machine learning groups and many more esteemed collaborators.

Due to between sessions/subjects variations in the properties of brain signals, typically, a large amount of training data needs to be collected at the beginning of each session to calibrate the parameters of the BCI system for the target user. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach on the classification domain to reduce the calibration time without sacrificing the classification accuracy of MI-BCI. Thus, when only few subject-specific trials are available for training, the estimation of the classification parameters is improved by incorporating previously recorded data from other users. For this purpose, a regularization parameter is added to the objective function of the classifier to make the classification parameters as close as possible to the classification parameters of the previous users who have feature spaces similar to that of the target subject. In this paper, a new similarity measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) is used to measure the similarity between two feature spaces obtained using subject-specific common spatial patterns (CSP). The proposed transfer learning approach is applied on the logistic regression classifier and evaluated using three datasets. The results showed that comparedwith the subject-specific classifier, the proposedweighted transfer learning classifier improved the classification results, particularly when few subject-specific trials were available for training (p < 0.05). Importantly, this improvement was more pronounced for users with medium and poor accuracy. Moreover, the statistical results showed that the proposed weighted transfer learning classifier performed significantly better than the considered comparable baseline algorithms.

Human intelligence as well as machine intelligence are incorporated to accomplish tasks efficiently and effectively. However, grasp-and-lift (GAL) tasks through human-robot interactions are still a problem in an unstructured environment like urban search and rescue. Human assistive GAL tasks enable robots to complete search or rescue procedures quickly and accurately. Brain-machine interface (BMI) controlled robots have demonstrated promising applications in human-robot collaborative manipulations. In this study, an architecture of human-robot team is proposed for performing GAL tasks in BMI-based human-robot systems. The proposed architecture contains several workflows from both human and robot aspects to improve performance. In addition, human brain activities are generally considered as non-stationary signals with varying spatial and temporal distributions. To enhance robustness and stability of brain-controlled robot's GAL tasks, a new method via adaptive boosting mechanism is proposed. The proposed multiple subjects' adaptive boosting is able to suppress noisy data and outliers in multiple subjects' electroencephalogram signals, and therefore enhance accuracy and robustness of intention and sensation signal classification in GAL tasks. Preliminary results show that the new architecture is feasible with ethical establishment and the proposed method can outperform traditional methods.

This is the case of Motor Imagery tasks involving Brain-Computer Interfaces through electroencephalography, where the number of available patterns is limited, making more noticeable the effect of the high dimensionality on the generalization capabilities of the models. This paper tackles classification in that particular setting, drawing a comparison between an explicit feature selection procedure using evolutionary computation and an implicit feature selection using Convolutional Neural Networks. These two alternatives are also compared to a Support Vector Machine approach that serves as a baseline quality threshold. According to the experiments performed in this paper, Convolutional Neural Networks are able to produce promising results when compared to the Support Vector Machine models and, after a partial hyperparameter optimization stage, also to previous work on the same dataset. Furthermore, this raises the issue of the trade-off between computational cost and classification accuracy, which is briefly discussed when assessing the quality of the results in relation to existing work.

Unfortunately, there is no specific test such as electroencephalography or blood test for diagnosing the disease. hi accordance with the previous studies, about 90% of people with PD have some types of voice abnormalities. Therefore, voice measurements can be used to detect the disease. Methods: This study presents an ensemble-based method for identifying patients and healthy samples by class label prediction based on voice frequency characteristics. It includes three stages of data preprocessing, internal classification and ultimate classification. The outcomes of internal classifiers next to primary feature vector of samples are considered the ultimate classifier inputs. Results: According to the results, the proposed method achieved 90.6% of accuracy, 95.8% of sensitivity, and 75% of specificity, admissible compared to those of other relevant studies. Conclusion: Current experimental outcomes provide a comparative analysis of various machine learning classifiers and confirm that using ensemble-based methods has improved medical diagnostic tasks.

Here, a multi-modal BCI which combines motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is proposed to achieve stable control of a quadcopter in three-dimensional physical space. The complete information common spatial pattern (CICSP) method is used to extract two MI features to control the quadcopter to fly left-forward and right-forward, and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is employed to perform the SSVEP classification for rise and fall. Eye blinking is designed to switch these two modes while hovering. Real-time feedback is provided to subjects by a global camera. Two flight tasks were conducted in physical space in order to certify the reliability of the BCI system. Subjects were asked to control the quadcopter to fly forward along the zig-zag pattern to pass through a gate in the relatively simple task. For the other complex task, the quadcopter was controlled to pass through two gates successively according to an S-shaped route. The performance of the BCI system is quantified using suitable metrics and subjects are able to acquire 86.5% accuracy for the complicated flight task. It is demonstrated that the multi-modal BCI has the ability to increase the accuracy rate, reduce the task burden, and improve the performance of the BCI system in the real world.

The time-course of component processes of selective attention	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Selective attention; MEG/EEG; Decoding; Attentional template; Visual processing	VISUAL-SEARCH; WORKING-MEMORY; TOP-DOWN; NEURAL MECHANISMS; FOCUSED ATTENTION; FEATURE BINDING; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; REPRESENTATIONS; INTERFERENCE	Attentional selection shapes human perception, enhancing relevant information, according to behavioral goals. While many studies have investigated individual neural signatures of attention, here we used multivariate decoding of electrophysiological brain responses (MEG/EEG) to track and compare multiple component processes of selective attention. Auditory cues instructed participants to select a particular visual target, embedded within a subsequent stream of displays. Combining single and multi-item displays with different types of distractors allowed multiple aspects of information content to be decoded, distinguishing distinct components of attention, as the selection process evolved. Although the task required comparison of items to an attentional "template" held in memory, signals consistent with such a template were largely undetectable throughout the preparatory period but re-emerged after presentation of a non-target choice display. Choice displays evoked strong neural representation of multiple target features, evolving over different timescales. We quantified five distinct processing operations with different time-courses. First, visual properties of the stimulus were strongly represented. Second, the candidate target was rapidly identified and localized in multi-item displays, providing the earliest evidence of modulation by behavioral relevance. Third, the identity of the target continued to be enhanced, relative to distractors. Fourth, only later was the behavioral significance of the target explicitly represented in single-item displays. Finally, if the target was not identified and search was to be resumed, then an attentional template was weakly reactivated. The observation that an item's behavioral relevance directs attention in multi-item displays prior to explicit representation of target/non-target status in single-item displays is consistent with two-stage models of attention.

J	Kumar, S; Vogels, R				Kumar, Satwant; Vogels, Rufin			Body Patches in Inferior Temporal Cortex Encode Categories with Different Temporal Dynamics	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							OBJECT RECOGNITION; MACAQUE; REPRESENTATIONS; FACES; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; PARALLEL; FEATURES; BRAIN; SPACE	An unresolved question in cognitive neuroscience is how representations of object categories at different levels (basic and superordinate) develop during the course of the neural response within an area. To address this, we decoded categories of different levels from the spiking responses of populations of neurons recorded in two fMRI-defined body patches in the macaque STS. Recordings of the two patches were made in the same animals with the same stimuli. Support vector machine classifiers were trained at brief response epochs and tested at the same or different epochs, thus assessing whether category representations change during the course of the response. In agreement with hierarchical processing within the body patch network, the posterior body patch mid STS body (MSB) showed an earlier onset of categorization compared with the anterior body patch anterior STS body (ASB), irrespective of the categorization level. Decoding of the superordinate body versus nonbody categories was less dynamic in MSB than in ASB, with ASB showing a biphasic temporal pattern. Decoding of the ordinate-level category human versus monkey bodies showed similar temporal patterns in both patches. The decoding onset of superordinate categorizations involving bodies was as early as for basic-level categorization, suggesting that previously reported differences between the onset of basic and superordinate categorizations may depend on the area. The qualitative difference between areas in their dynamics of category representation may hinder the interpretation of decoding dynamics based on EEG or MEG, methods that may mix signals of different areas.

BCI inefficiency subject is defied as the subject who cannot achieve classification accuracy higher than 70% since 70% is considered to be the minimum accuracy for communication by BCI. About 15-30% of the people are MI-BCI inefficiency according to the investigation. Most of the existing studies used common spatial patterns (CSP) to extract motor imagery feature and identify MI-BCI inefficiency subject based on the obtained classification accuracy. We think the MI-BCI performance maybe suppressed because CSP mainly extracts event-related desynchronization (ERD) feature, while the features generated by motor imagery are more than that. In this current work, we screened a total of 12 MI-BCI inefficiency subjects by CSP feature firstly, and recorded the motor imagery EEG data of them. Furthermore, we constructed a task-related brain network by calculating the coherence between EEG channels, the graph-based analysis showed that the node degree and clustering coefficient have intensity differences between left and right hand motor imagery. Finally, the two kinds of features were used to discriminate the two tasks. The results showed that both node degree and clustering coefficient features perform better than CSP, and the feature combination of brain network and CSP achieved higher accuracy than a single feature. In particular, a total of four subjects achieved accuracy higher than 70% by node degree and CSP features fusion. This work demonstrates that the accuracy of the MI-BCI inefficiency subject can be increased by using the brain network feature, but the accuracy gains are not high enough; it is worth to try other types of feature extraction algorithms for the MI-BCI inefficiency subject.

Seizure prediction may markedly improve epilepsy management and, therefore, the quality of life of persons with epilepsy. Methods: Literature review. Results: Seizures tend to occur following complex non-random patterns. Circadian oscillators may contribute to the rhythmic patterns of seizure occurrence. Complex mathematical models based on chaos theory try to explain and even predict seizure occurrence. There are several patterns of epileptic seizure occurrence based on seizure location, seizure semiology, and hormonal factors, among others. These patterns are most frequently described for large populations. Inter-individual variability and complex inter-actions between the rhythmic generators continue to make it more difficult to predict seizures in any individual person. The increasing use of large databases and machine learning techniques may help better define patterns of seizure occurrence in individual patients. Improvements in seizure detection-such as wearable seizure detectors-and in seizure prediction-such as machine learning techniques and artificial as well as neuronal networks-promise to provide further progress in the field of epilepsy and are being applied to closed-loop systems for the treatment of epilepsy. Conclusions: Seizures tend to occur following complex and patient-specific patterns despite their apparently random occurrence. A better understanding of these patterns and current technological advances may allow the implementation of closed-loop detection, prediction, and treatment systems in routine clinical practice.

The technique has recorded a number of achievements for unearthing meaningful features and accomplishing tasks that were hitherto difficult to solve by other methods and human experts. Currently, biological and medical devices, treatment, and applications are capable of generating large volumes of data in the form of images, sounds, text, graphs, and signals creating the concept of big data. The innovation of DL is a developing trend in the wake of big data for data representation and analysis. DL is a type of machine learning algorithm that has deeper (or more) hidden layers of similar function cascaded into the network and has the capability to make meaning from medical big data. Current transformation drivers to achieve personalized health care delivery will be possible with the use of mobile health (mHealth). DL can provide the analysis for the deluge of data generated from mHealth apps. This review paper highlights the fundamentals of DL methods and presents a general view of the trends in DL by capturing literature from PubMed and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers database publications that implement different variants of DL. We highlighted the implementation of DL in health care, which we categorize into biological system, electronic health record, medical image, and physiological signals. In addition, we discussed some inherent challenges of DL affecting biomedical and health domain, as well as prospective research directions that focus on improving health management by promoting the application of physiological signals and modern internet technology.

Scheduling resources in such an environment would be an NP-Hard problem. This article has studied the concept of scheduling in fog with Bayesian classification which could be applied to gain the task requirements like the processing ones. After classification, virtual machines will be created in accordance with the predicted requirements. The ifogsim simulator has been applied to study our fog-based Bayesian classification scheduling (FBCS) method performance in an EEG tractor application. Algorithms have been evaluated on a practical application of brain signal tracking system. According to the results, the FBCS method, compared with other methods, has reduced the energy consumption in the cloud and the executing task cost in cloud; and also the average of energy consuming in mobiles has been decreased by smart decision making.

Recent work crowdsourced state-of-the-art prediction algorithms in a worldwide competition, yielding improvements in seizure prediction performance for patients whose seizures were previously found hard to anticipate. The aim of the current analysis was to explore potential performance improvements using an ensemble of the top competition algorithms. The results suggest that minor increments in performance may be possible; however, the outcomes of statistical testing limit the confidence in these increments. Our results suggest that for the specific algorithms, evaluation framework, and data considered here, incremental improvements are achievable but there may be upper bounds on machine learning-based seizure prediction performance for some patients whose seizures are challenging to predict. Other more tailored approaches that, for example, take into account a deeper understanding of preictal mechanisms, patient-specific sleep-wake rhythms, or novel measurement approaches, may still offer further gains for these types of patients.

TSK fuzzy system is an important research direction in the field of artificial intelligence. It has been widely successful in many fields. However, it is still a serious challenge to further apply fuzzy systems to medical research, such as further improving the classification performance of EEG signals. Based on the strong cohesive feature diffusion, an integrated multi-model deep Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy classification system (IMD-TSK-FS) is proposed. IMD-TSK-FS is a training structure similar to deep multi-level superposition. Each training layer of IMD-TSK-FS is composed of several training modules. Different from other classifiers, IMD-TSK-FS satisfies: (1) IMD-TSK-FS fully considers the difference of classification ability between all TSK fuzzy systems in a training module. In this study, the purpose of the balance mechanism is to highlight the classification performance of different classifiers. For each training module of IMD-TSK-FS, their integration weights are determined entirely by the classification performance of the corresponding classifier in the whole training module, instead of taking the average or completely random. (2) The consequent parameters of each TSK fuzzy rule are obtained by means of the extreme learning machine (ELM), not the gradient descent-based quadratic optimization techniques. Finally, the experimental results verify that IMD-TSK-FS is very suitable for EEG signal classification, and indirectly show that IMD-TSK-FS is a promising classification model.

Type II diabetes is also closely related to brain recognition, so it is extremely necessary to diagnose the patient's cognition as early as possible. Among them, the event-related potential (ERP) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important research method. In order to diagnose the disease more accurately, machine learning has been widely used. However, deep learning still has a broad application space. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is high-performance model for deep learning. In this study, we constructed a Daul input encoder convolutional neural network (DIE-CNN) for event related potential (ERP) data with type 2 diabetes. In experiments with multiple models, DIE -CNN performed optimally. The results show that DIE-CNN is an effective method to diagnose the condition of the subject, and the method also retains the expansion space to build a more complex comprehensive evaluation system.

J	Nagel, S; Spuler, M				Nagel, Sebastian; Spueler, Martin			World's fastest brain-computer interface: Combining EEG2Code with deep learning	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMMUNICATION	We present a novel approach based on deep learning for decoding sensory information from non-invasively recorded Electroencephalograms (EEG). It can either be used in a passive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to predict properties of a visual stimulus the person is viewing, or it can be used to actively control a BCI application. Both scenarios were tested, whereby an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 701 bit/min was achieved for the passive BCI approach with the best subject achieving an online ITR of 1237 bit/min. Further, it allowed the discrimination of 500,000 different visual stimuli based on only 2 seconds of EEG data with an accuracy of up to 100%. When using the method for an asynchronous self-paced BCI for spelling, an average utility rate of 175 bit/min was achieved, which corresponds to an average of 35 error-free letters per minute. As the presented method extracts more than three times more information than the previously fastest approach, we suggest that EEG signals carry more information than generally assumed. Finally, we observed a ceiling effect such that information content in the EEG exceeds that required for BCI control, and therefore we discuss if BCI research has reached a point where the performance of non-invasive visual BCI control cannot be substantially improved anymore.

It is obvious that the chances of survival can be increased if the tumor is identified and properly classified at an initial stage. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is one source of brain tumors detection tool and is extensively used in the diagnosis of brain to detect blood clots. In the past, many researchers developed Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems that help the radiologist to detect the abnormalities in an efficient manner. Objective: The aim of this research is to improve the brain tumor detection performance by proposing a multimodal feature extracting strategy and employing machine learning techniques. Methods: In this study, we extracted multimodal features such as texture, morphological, entropy-based, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and Elliptic Fourier Descriptors (EFDs) from brain tumor imaging database. The tumor was detected using robust machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) with kernels: polynomial, Radial Base Function (RBF), Gaussian; Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes. Most commonly used Jack-knife 10-fold Cross-Validation (CV) was used for testing and validation of dataset. Results: The performance was evaluated in terms of specificity, sensitivity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), False Positive Rate (FPR), Total Accuracy (TA), Area under the receiver operating Curve (AUC), and P-value. The highest performance of 100% in terms of Specificity, Sensitivity, PPV, NPV, TA, AUC using Naive Bayes classifiers based on entropy, morphological, SIFT and texture features followed by Decision Tree classifier with texture features (TA=97.81%, AUC=1.0) and SVM polynomial kernel with texture features (TA= 94.63%). The highest significant p-value was obtained using SVM polynomial with texture features (P-value 2.65e-104) followed by SVM RB with texture features (P-value 1.96e-98). Conclusion: The results reveal that Naive Bayes followed by Decision Tree gives highest detection accuracy based on entropy, morphological, SIFT and texture features.

Online transmission of such data demands schemes rendering significant performance with lesser computations. To compact such data, numerous compression algorithms have been introduced in the literature. Heretofore single channel algorithms when extended to multichannel applications do not accomplish remarkable results. If achieved it generally results in higher computational cost. Much of this chapter deals with the development of computationally simple algorithms that aim to reduce the computational aspects without comprising on the compression and decompression performance. Also, the amicability of this implementation supporting efficient storage with low bandwidth is performed. The objective of this chapter is to introduce some of the basic supporting concepts for exploiting data representation redundancies that aid compression. Accordingly, simple and novel compression schemes with its simulation comparison are presented in this chapter. The potency of the direct domain compression model is assessed in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction error between the original and reconstructed dataset. A significant compression with substantially low Percent Root-mean-square Difference (PRD) is accomplished by the novel compression schemes, thereby upholding diagnostic information of EEG for telemedicine applications with higher reconstruction accuracy and reduced computational load.

Validation of 'Somnivore', a Machine Learning Algorithm for Automated Scoring and Analysis of Polysomnography Data	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						machine learning algorithms; polysomnography; signal processing algorithms; sleep stage classification; wake-sleep stage scoring	SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; AMERICAN ACADEMY; POWER SPECTRA; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; DURATION; IMPAIRMENT; RECORDINGS	Manual scoring of polysomnography data is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and most existing software does not account for subjective differences and user variability. Therefore, we evaluated a supervised machine learning algorithm, Somnivore (TM), for automated wake-sleep stage classification. We designed an algorithm that extracts features from various input channels, following a brief session of manual scoring, and provides automated wake-sleep stage classification for each recording. For algorithm validation, polysomnography data was obtained from independent laboratories, and include normal, cognitively-impaired, and alcohol-treated human subjects (total n = 52), narcoleptic mice and drug-treated rats (total n = 56), and pigeons (n = 5). Training and testing sets for validation were previously scored manually by 1-2 trained sleep technologists from each laboratory. F-measure was used to assess precision and sensitivity for statistical analysis of classifier output and human scorer agreement. The algorithm gave high concordance with manual visual scoring across all human data (wake 0.91 +/- 0.01; N1 0.57 +/- 0.01; N2 0.81 +/- 0.01; N3 0.86 +/- 0.01; REM 0.87 +/- 0.01), which was comparable to manual inter-scorer agreement on all stages. Similarly, high concordance was observed across all rodent (wake 0.95 +/- 0.01; NREM 0.94 +/- 0.01; REM 0.91 +/- 0.01) and pigeon (wake 0.96 +/- 0.006; NREM 0.97 +/- 0.01; REM 0.86 +/- 0.02) data. Effects of classifier learning from single signal inputs, simple stage reclassification, automated removal of transition epochs, and training set size were also examined. In summary, we have developed a polysomnography analysis program for automated sleep-stage classification of data from diverse species. Somnivore enables flexible, accurate, and high-throughput analysis of experimental and clinical sleep studies.

Emotion detection among individuals using EEG is often reported to classify people based on emotions. We questioned this observation and hypothesized that different people respond differently to emotional stimuli and have an intrinsic predisposition to respond. We designed experiments to study the responses of participants to various emotional stimuli in order to compare participant-wise categorization to emotion-wise categorization of the data. The experiments were conducted on a homogeneous set of 20 participants by administering 9 short, one to two minute movie clips depicting different emotional content. The EEG signal data was recorded using the 128 channel high-density geodesic net. The data was filtered, segmented, converted to frequency domain and alpha, beta and theta ranges were extracted. Clustering was performed using a novel recursive-split and merge unsupervised algorithm. The data was analyzed through confusion matrices, plots and normalization techniques. It was found that the variation in emotive responses of a participant was significantly lower than the variation across participants. This resulted in more efficient participant-based clustering as compared to emotive stimuli-based clustering. We concluded that the emotive response is perhaps a signature of an individual with a characteristic pattern of EEG signals. Our findings on further experimentation will prove valuable for the progress of research in cognitive sciences, security and other related areas.

The aim of this research is to utilize the different features of EEG signal to recognize the brain activity. The composite feature model with ELM classification method is presented in this research to recognize the human activity. In this paper, multiple aspects including time domain, frequency domain and least square evaluation based features are processed under ELM classifier to recognize the human-activities. Multiple quantified features are generated under each time, frequency and the least square categories. These features are processed individually and mutually with probabilistic evaluation to expand the processing-featureset. This expanded-composite featureset is trained under ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) classifier to perform intra-class and inter-class classification. The experimentation is applied on five distinctive experiments of Dataset IIIa of BCI completion III. Each experiment is conducted with variant training and testing instances. The evaluation results identified that the proposed hybrid model has achieved the average accuracy over 80%. Comparative results are generated against ANN, SVM, KNN and Multiscale Wavelet Kernel ELM by utilizing each kind of individual and mutual feature. The results taken from various experimentations have validated that the proposed model has improved the accuracy against each of the existing feature processed classification methods.

The developed system was trained using the supposedly most reliable sleepiness indicators available, extracted from electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electrooculography, and driving performance data (steering behavior and lane positioning). Sequential forward floating selection was used to select the most descriptive features, and five different classifiers were tested. A unique data set with 86 drivers, obtained while driving on real roads in real traffic, both in alert and sleep deprived conditions, was used to train and test the classifiers. Subjective ratings using the Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) was used to split the data as sufficiently alert (KSS <= 6) or sleepy (KSS >= 8). KSS = 7 was excluded to get a clearer distinction between the groups. A random forest classifier was found to be the most robust classifier with an accuracy of 94.1% (sensitivity 86.5%, specificity 95.7%). The results further showed the importance of personalizing a sleepiness detection system. When testing the classifier on data from a person that it had not been trained on, the sensitivity dropped to 41.4%. One way to improve the sensitivity was to add a biomathematical model of sleepiness amongst the features, which increased the sensitivity to 66.2% for participant-independent classification. Future works include taking contextual features into account, using classifiers that takes full advantage of sequential data, and to develop models that adapt to individual drivers.

"Hurdles" pattern does not meet the criteria of the electrical status epilepticus in slow-wave sleep (ESES). Methods In a retrospective analysis, 24 patients with "hurdles" and their 24 peers matched for demographic and epilepsy-related variables were compared in terms of neuropsychological domains and electroencephalography (EEG)-derived quantifiers. Both "hurdles" and controls were children between 2 and 19 years of age who had intractable focal epilepsy evaluated as candidates of resective epilepsy surgery. Results Full-scale intelligence quotient/developmental quotient (FSIQ/DQ) (P = .002) and visuoconstructional skills (P = .004) were significantly lower in children with "hurdles" compared to controls. Patients with "hurdles" presented with higher interictal spike indexes in sleep (P < .001, median difference -0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.4, -0.6) and wakefulness (P < .001, median difference -0.3, 95% CI -0.5, -1). Relative time of sleep spindles in NREM sleep was significantly reduced (P < .001, median difference 0.1, 95% CI 0.0, 0.1) in the "hurdles" group. The time proportion of sleep spindles represented a significant positive (P = .008) and spike index of generalized spikes in sleep a significant negative explanatory variable (P = .004) of FSIQ/DQ scores. The proportion of seizure-free patients 2 years after epilepsy surgery did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = .19). Significance Although the "hurdles" pattern does not fulfill the criteria of ESES, it is associated with a pronounced cognitive dysfunction. Disturbed sleep structure marked by reduced sleep spindles and generalized spiking in sleep is associated with worse cognitive performance. Despite having a generalized nature, we did not find a lower probability of postsurgical seizure freedom in patients with "hurdles" pattern.

As a noninvasive and easy-touse category of measures, current photoplethysmogram- (PPG) based assessment methods rely on single or small-scale predefined features to recognize responses induced by people's cognitive load, which are not stable in assessment accuracy. In this study, we propose a machine-learning method by using 46 kinds of PPG features together to improve the measurement accuracy for cognitive load. We test the method on 16 participants through the classical n-back tasks (0-back, 1-back, and 2-back). The accuracy of the machine-learning method in differentiating different levels of cognitive loads induced by task difficulties can reach 100% in 0-back vs. 2-back tasks, which outperformed the traditional HRV-based and single-PPG-feature-based methods by 12-55%. When using "leave-one-participant-out" subject-independent cross validation, 87.5% binary classification accuracy was reached, which is at the state-of-the-art level. The proposed method can also support real-time cognitive load assessment by beat-to-beat classifications with better performance than the traditional single-feature-based real-time evaluation method.

J	Daube, C; Ince, RAA; Gross, J				Daube, Christoph; Ince, Robin A. A.; Gross, Joachim			Simple Acoustic Features Can Explain Phoneme-Based Predictions of Cortical Responses to Speech	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							INFORMATION; DYNAMICS; COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; PRINCIPLES; FREQUENCY; ENVELOPE; MODELS; MEG	When we listen to speech, we have to make sense of a waveform of sound pressure. Hierarchical models of speech perception assume that, to extract semantic meaning, the signal is transformed into unknown, intermediate neuronal representations. Traditionally, studies of such intermediate representations are guided by linguistically defined concepts, such as phonemes. Here, we argue that in order to arrive at an unbiased understanding of the neuronal responses to speech, we should focus instead on representations obtained directly from the stimulus. We illustrate our view with a data-driven, information theoretic analysis of a dataset of 24 young, healthy humans who listened to a 1 h narrative while their magnetoencephalogram (MEG) was recorded. We find that two recent results, the improved performance of an encoding model in which annotated linguistic and acoustic features were combined and the decoding of phoneme subgroups from phoneme-locked responses, can be explained by an encoding model that is based entirely on acoustic features. These acoustic features capitalize on acoustic edges and outperform Gabor-filtered spectrograms, which can explicitly describe the spectrotemporal characteristics of individual phonemes. By replicating our results in publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) data, we conclude that models of brain responses based on linguistic features can serve as excellent benchmarks. However, we believe that in order to further our understanding of human cortical responses to speech, we should also explore low-level and parsimonious explanations for apparent high-level phenomena.

However, the existing classification techniques are either computationally expensive or not so accurate or both. To address this limitation, in this work, a sparse representation based classification technique has been proposed to classify multi-tasks MI electroencephalogram data. The proposed method computes only wavelet energy directly from the segmented MI data and constructs a dictionary. The sparse representation from the dictionary is then used to classify given a test data. The proposed approach is faster as it works with only a single feature and without the need for any preprocessing. Further, with a reduced length of an imaging period, the proposed method provides accurate classification in a lesser computation time. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated and also compared with other classifiers reported in the literature. The results substantiate that the proposed sparsity approach performs significantly better than the existing classifiers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Sreeja, S.

Traditional tests for coma outcome prediction are based mainly on a set of clinical observations. Recently, certain event-related potentials (ERPs), which are transient electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to auditory, visual or tactile stimuli, have been introduced as useful predictors of a positive coma outcome (ie, emergence). However, such tests require the skills of clinical neurophysiologists, who are not commonly available in many clinical settings. Additionally, none of the current standard clinical approaches have sufficient predictive accuracies to provide definitive prognoses. Objective The objective of this study is to develop improved machine learning procedures based on EEG/ERP for determining emergence from coma. Methods and analysis Data will be collected from 50 participants in coma. EEG/ERP data will be recorded for 24 consecutive hours at a maximum of five time points spanning 30 days from the date of recruitment to track participants' progression. The study employs paradigms designed to elicit brainstem potentials, middle-latency responses, N100, mismatch negativity, P300 and N400. In the case of patient emergence, data are recorded on that occasion to form an additional basis for comparison. A relevant data set will be developed from the testing of 20 healthy controls, each spanning a 15-hour recording period in order to formulate a baseline. Collected data will be used to develop an automated procedure for analysis and detection of various ERP components that are salient to prognosis. Salient features extracted from the ERP and resting-state EEG will be identified and combined to give an accurate indicator of prognosis. Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (project number 4840). Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at scientific conferences.

Out of all, bruxism is a common behavior, which is found in 8-31% of the population. Bruxism is a sleep disorder in which individuals involuntarily grinds and clenches the teeth. The main aim of this work is to detect sleep bruxism by analyzing the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrum analysis of the change in the domain of different stages of sleep. The present research was performed in different stages such as collection of the data, preprocessing of the EEG signal, analysis of the C4-P4 and C4-A1 channels, comparison between healthy humans and bruxism patients, and classification using decision tree method. In this study, the channels C4-P4 and C4-A1 of the EEG signal were combined for the detection of bruxism by using Welch technique, which mainly focused on two sleep stages such as S1 and rapid eye movement. The total number of EEG channels of healthy humans and bruxism patients analyzed in this work were 15 and 18, respectively. The results showed that the individual accuracy of the C4-P4 and C4-A1 channels was 81.70% and 74.11%, respectively. The combined accuracy of both C4-P4 and C4-A1 channels was 81.25%. The specificity of combined result was higher than individual. In addition, the value of theta activity during detection is consistent throughout the period, and the accuracy of S1 stage is better than rapid eye movement stage. We proposed that the theta activity of S1 could be taken for the detection of bruxism. The proposed approach in the detection of the bruxism is negligible in noise as it is in mathematical form and has taken very less time as compared with the traditional systems. The present research work would provide a fast and effective detection system of the sleep bruxism with high accuracy for medical big data applications.

CNN and other deep learning methods have gained attention in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) domain also. Here, we investigate a CNN-based model with two different optimizers for reducing error of classification of brain states using EEG motor imagery data. Two different optimizers namely stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and adaptive momentum (Adam) are investigated for increasing classification accuracy using the well-known BCI competition IV 2b dataset. The study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of a single deep learning model for all subjects without compromising on information decoding rate for any of the BCI participants. Using two different models, mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.32% (+/- 2.2) was achieved across participants, which is significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to a state-of-the-art deep learning approach.

While, the human can clearly detect the existence of errors, which is manifested in the central nervous activity characteristics. To date, the majority of studies on falling-risk detection have focused primarily on computer vision and physical signals. There are no reports of falling-risk detection methods based on neural activity. In this study, we propose a novel method to monitor multi erroneous motion events using electroencephalogram (EEG) features. There were 15 subjects who participated in this study, who kept standing with an upper limb supported posture and received an unpredictable postural perturbation. EEG signal analysis revealed a high negative peak with a maximum averaged amplitude of -14.75 +/- 5.99 mu V, occurring at 62 ms after postural perturbation. The xDAWN algorithm was used to reduce the high-dimension of EEG signal features. And, Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was used to train a classifier. The detection rate of the falling-risk onset is 98.67%. And the detection latency is 334ms, when we set detection rate beyond 90% as the standard of dangerous event onset. Further analysis showed that the falling-risk detection method based on postural perturbation evoked potential features has a good generalization ability. The model based on typical event data achieved 94.2% detection rate for unlearned atypical perturbation events. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using neural response to detect dangerous fall events.

Previous investigations have demonstrated a strong neural overlap between self-related activity and resting state activity. This suggests that information about self-relatedness is encoded in our brain's spontaneous activity. The exact neuronal mechanisms of such rest-self containment, however, remain unclear. The present EEG study investigated temporal measures of resting state EEG to relate them to self-consciousness. This was obtained with the self-consciousness scale (SCS) which measures Private, Public, and Social dimensions of self. We demonstrate positive correlations between Private self-consciousness and three temporal measures of resting state activity: scale-free activity as indexed by the power-law exponent (PLE), the auto-correlation window (ACW), and modulation index (MI). Specifically, higher PLE, longer ACW, and stronger MI were related to higher degrees of Private self-consciousness. Finally, conducting eLORETA for spatial tomography, we found significant correlation of Private self-consciousness with activity in cortical midline structures such as the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. These results were reinforced with a data-driven analysis; a machine learning algorithm accurately predicted an individual as having a high or low Private self-consciousness score based on these measures of the brain's spatiotemporal structure. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Private self-consciousness is related to the temporal structure of resting state activity as featured by temporal nestedness (PLE), temporal continuity (ACW), and temporal integration (MI). Our results support the hypothesis that self-related information is temporally contained in the brain's resting state. Rest-self containment can thus be featured by a temporal signature.

Exposure-based therapy is currently one of the most effective treatments for PTSD. However, exposure to traumatic stimuli is so aversive that a significant number of patients drop-out of therapy during the course of treatment. Among various attempts to develop novel therapies that bypass such aversiveness, neurofeedback appears promising. With neurofeedback, patients can unconsciously self-regulate brain activity via real-time monitoring and feedback of the EEG or fMRI signals. With conventional neurofeedback methods, however, it is difficult to induce neural representation related to specific trauma because the feedback is based on the neural signals averaged within specific brain areas. To overcome this difficulty, novel neurofeedback approaches such as Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) might prove helpful. Instead of the average BOLD signals, DecNef allows patients to implicitly regulate multivariate voxel patterns of the BOLD signals related with feared stimuli. As such, DecNef effects are postulated to derive either from exposure or counter-conditioning, or some combination of both. Although the exact mechanism is not yet fully understood. DecNef has been successfully applied to reduce fear responses induced either by fear-conditioned or phobic stimuli among non-clinical participants. Methods: Follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted to compare DecNef effect with those of conventional EEG/fMRI-based neurofeedback on PTSD amelioration. To elucidate the possible mechanisms of DecNef on fear reduction, we mathematically modeled the effects of exposure-based and counter conditioning separately and applied it to the data obtained from past DecNef studies. Finally, we conducted DecNef on four PTSD patients. Here, we review recent advances in application of neurofeedback to PTSD treatments, including the DecNef. This review is intended to be informative for neuroscientists in general as well as practitioners planning to use neurofeedback as a therapeutic strategy for PTSD. Results: Our mathematical model suggested that exposure is the key component for DecNef effects in the past studies. Following DecNef a significant reduction of PTSD severity was observed. This effect was comparable to those reported for conventional neurofeedback approach. Conclusions: Although a much larger number of participants will be needed in future, DecNef could be a promising therapy that bypasses the unpleasantness of conscious exposure associated with conventional therapies for fear related disorders, including PTSD.

Acting directly by decoding neural activity is a very natural way of interaction and one of the fundamental paradigms of brain computer interfaces (BCIs) as well. In this paper, we present a wearable Internet of Things node designed for BCI spelling. The system is based on visual evoked potentials detection and runs the canonical correlation analysis on a low power microcontroller. Neural data is acquired by an array of electroencephalography active dry electrodes, suitable for a minimally intrusive interface. To evaluate our solution, we optimized the system on eight subjects and tested it on five different subjects for four and eight stimuli, reaching a peak transfer rate of 1.57 b/s, comparable with those achieved by state-of-the-art nonembedded systems. The power consumption of the device is less than 30 mW, resulting in 122 h of operation with a standard 1000-mAh battery.

This so-called "neural envelope tracking" has been shown to relate to speech understanding in normal hearing listeners, but has barely been investigated in persons wearing cochlear implants (CI). We investigated the relation between speech understanding and neural envelope tracking in CI users. EEG was recorded in 8 CI users while they listened to a story. Speech understanding was varied by changing the intensity of the presented speech. The speech envelope was reconstructed from the EEG using a linear decoder. Next, the reconstructed envelope was correlated with the envelope of the speech stimulus as a measure of neural envelope tracking which was compared to actual speech understanding. This study showed that neural envelope tracking increased with increasing speech understanding in every participant. Furthermore behaviorally measured speech understanding was correlated with participant-specific neural envelope tracking results indicating the potential of neural envelope tracking as an objective measure of speech understanding in CI users. This could enable objective and automatic fitting of CIs and pave the way towards closed-loop CIs that adjust continuously and automatically to individual CI users. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Early seizure detection for closed loop direct neurostimulation devices in epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						responsive neurostimulation; machine learning; convolutional neural networks; intracranial EEG; epilepsy	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; BRAIN-RESPONSIVE NEUROSTIMULATION; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; REAL-TIME DETECTION; LONG-TERM; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION; DETECTION ALGORITHM; ANTERIOR NUCLEUS	Current treatment concepts for epilepsy are based on continuous drug delivery or electrical stimulation to prevent the occurrence of seizures, exposing the brain and body to a mostly unneeded risk of adverse effects. To address the infrequent occurrence and short duration of epileptic seizures, intelligent implantable closed-loop devices are needed which are based on a refined analysis of ongoing brain activity with highly specific and fast detection algorithms to allow for timely, ictal interventions. Since the development and FDA approval of a first closed loop neurostimulation device relying on simple threshold-based approaches, machine learning approaches became widely available, probably outperformed in the near future by deep convolutional neural networks, which already showed to be extremely successful in pattern recognition in images and partly in signal analysis. Handcrafted features or rules defined by experts become replaced by systematic feature selection procedures and systematic hyperparameter search approaches. Training of these classifiers augments the need of large databases with intracranial EEG recordings, which is partly given by existing databases but potentially can be replaced by continuously transferring data from implanted devices and their publication for research purposes. Already in early design states, the final target hardware must be taken into account for algorithm development. Size, power consumption and, as a consequence, limited computational resources given by low power microcontrollers, FPGAs and ASICS limit the complexity of feature computation, classifier complexity, and the numbers and complexity of layers of deep neuronal networks. Novel approaches for early seizure detection will be a key module for new generations of closed-loop devices together with improved low power implant hardware and will provide together with more efficient intervention paradigms new treatment options for patients with difficult to treat epilepsy.

An Analytical Framework for Security-Tuning of Artificial Intelligence Applications Under Attack	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TESTING (AITEST)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing (IEEE AITest)	APR 04-09, 2019	San Francisco, CA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Exactpro, IBM, EduCoder NET		artificial intelligence; machine learning; security; perturbation attack; parameters tuning; optimization		Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as the core technology in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as self-driving vehicles, make important decisions by performing a variety of data classification or prediction tasks. Attacks on data or algorithms in AI applications can lead to misclassification or misprediction, which can fail the applications. For each dataset separately, the parameters of ML algorithms should be tuned to reach a desirable classification or prediction accuracy. Typically, ML experts tune the parameters empirically, which can be time consuming and does not guarantee the optimal result. To this end, some research suggests an analytical approach to tune the ML parameters for maximum accuracy. However, none of the works consider the ML performance under attack in their tuning process. This paper proposes an analytical framework for tuning the ML parameters to be secure against attacks, while keeping its accuracy high. The framework finds the optimal set of parameters by defining a novel objective function, which takes into account the test results of both ML accuracy and its security against attacks. For validating the framework, an AI application is implemented to recognize whether a subject's eyes are open or closed, by applying k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on her Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this application, the number of neighbors (k) and the distance metric type, as the two main parameters of kNN, are chosen for tuning. The input data perturbation attack, as one of the most common attacks on ML algorithms, is used for testing the security of the application. Exhaustive search approach is used to solve the optimization problem. The experiment results show k = 43 and cosine distance metric is the optimal configuration of kNN for the EEG dataset, which leads to 83.75% classification accuracy and reduces the attack success rate to 5.21%.

However, the estimation of emotions in real-time poses a problem that has not yet been optimized. An optimization is proposed for the emotion estimation methodology including artifact removal, feature extraction, feature smoothing, and brain pattern classification. The challenge of filtering artifacts and extracting features, while reducing processing time and maintaining high accuracy results, is attempted in this work. First, two different approaches for real-time electro-oculographic artifact removal techniques are tested and compared in terms of loss of information and processing time. Second, an emotion estimation methodology is proposed based on a set of stable and meaningful features, a carefully chosen set of electrodes, and the smoothing of the feature space. The methodology has proved to perform on real-time constraints while maintaining high accuracy on emotion estimation on the SEED database, both under subject dependent and subject independent paradigms, to test the methodology on a discrete emotional model with three affective states.

J	Yan, JZ; Kuai, HZ; Chen, JH; Zhong, N				Yan, Jianzhuo; Kuai, Hongzhi; Chen, Jianhui; Zhong, Ning			Analyzing Emotional Oscillatory Brain Network for Valence and Arousal-Based Emotion Recognition Using EEG Data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; oscillation; synchronization; emotional oscillatory brain network; emotion recognition	SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA; SELECTION; DYNAMICS; THETA; CLASSIFICATION; INTENSITY; REFLECT; STATE	Emotion recognition is a highly noteworthy and challenging work in both cognitive science and affective computing. Currently, neurobiology studies have revealed the partially synchronous oscillating phenomenon within brain, which needs to be analyzed from oscillatory synchronization. This combination of oscillations and synchronism is worthy of further exploration to achieve inspiring learning of the emotion recognition models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of valence and arousal-based emotion recognition using EEG data. First, we construct the emotional oscillatory brain network (EOBN) inspired by the partially synchronous oscillating phenomenon for emotional valence and arousal. And then, a coefficient of variation and Welch's t-test based feature selection method is used to identify the core pattern (cEOBN) within EOBN for different emotional dimensions. Finally, an emotional recognition model (ERM) is built by combining cEOBN-inspired information obtained in the above process and different classifiers. The proposed approach can combine oscillation and synchronization characteristics of multi-channel EEG signals for recognizing different emotional states under the valence and arousal dimensions. The cEOBN-based inspired information can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data. The experimental results show that the previous method can be used to detect affective state at a reasonable level of accuracy.

In this paper, a novel source localization method is proposed to model the EEG inverse problem using spatio-temporal long-short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM). The network model consists of two parts, sEEG encoding and source decoding, to model the sEEG signal and receive the regression of source location. As there does not exist enough annotated sEEG signals correspond to specific source locations, simulated data is generated with forward model using finite element method (FEM) to act as a part of training signals. A framework for source localization is proposed to estimate the source position based on simulated training data. Experiments are done on simulated testing data. The results on simulated data exhibit good robustness on noise signal, and the proposed network solves the EEG inverse problem with spatio-temporal deep network. The result show that the proposed method overcomes the highly ill-posed linear inverse problem with data driven learning.

Pattern of Brain Injury Predicts Long-Term Epilepsy Following Neonatal Encephalopathy	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalography; hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; neonatal seizures; magnetic resonance imaging; epilepsy; children	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; NEWBORNS; HYPOTHERMIA; MRI; CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURES; OUTCOMES; CHILDREN; INFANTS; RISK	Objective: To determine if patterns of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in term newborns predict subsequent childhood epilepsy. Methods: This retrospective cohort study includes term newborns with encephalopathy (n = 181) born between 2004-2012 and admitted to British Columbia Children's Hospital. MRI was performed between 3 and 5 days of age. The predominant patterns of hypoxic-ischemic injury were classified as Normal, Watershed, Basal Nuclei, Total, and Focal-Multifocal. Lesions in hippocampus, motor and occipital cortex were noted. Results: Of 181 newborns, 166 (92%) survived the neonatal period, and 132 (80%) had follow-up with a median duration of 61 months (IQR: 28-95). Twenty-three children (17%) developed epilepsy. A higher proportion with Watershed, Basal Nuclei, or Total patterns developed epilepsy (P < .001). Injury to motor cortex, hippocampus, and occipital lobe (P < .01) were independent risk factors for epilepsy. In the adjusting logistic model, Watershed (odds ratio = 16.0, 95% CI [1.3, 197.2], P = .03) and Basal Nuclei injury (odds ratio = 19.4, 95% CI [1.9, 196.3], P = .01) remained independent risk factors. Therapeutic hypothermia did not alter these associations. Severity of brain injury and recurrent neonatal seizures are other clinical risk factors. Significance: In term newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, the predominant pattern ofWatershed and Basal Nuclei injury are valuable predictors for development of epilepsy in later childhood.

This clinical picture significantly affects the daily lives of patients, which in some cases, the occurrence of seizures can promote injury, trauma or even sudden death. People who suffer from epilepsy could live free of seizures, if they were previously diagnosed or given appropriate treatment. Therefore methodologies that simplify and expedite the diagnosis and treatment of these individuals are valid and necessary. This study aims to develop a classification model of electroencephalograms (EEG) with presence or absence of epileptic seizures. It was adapted a methodology of extraction of characteristics used for classification of electrocardiograms (ECG) with or without cardiac arrhythmias, which is based on the calculation of statistical moments in time windows. After defining the statistical characteristic that promotes greater separation between the two groups, this characteristic was calculated from a set of 119 electroencephalograms from the CHB-MIT database.

Removing Confounding Factors Associated Weights in Deep Neural Networks Improves the Prediction Accuracy for Healthcare Applications	PACIFIC SYMPOSIUM ON BIOCOMPUTING 2019	Biocomputing-Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing		English	Proceedings Paper	24th Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB)	JAN 03-07, 2019	HI			neural networks; healthcare; confounding factor correction	SEGMENTATION; DISPARITIES; MRI	The proliferation of healthcare data has brought the opportunities of applying data-driven approaches, such as machine learning methods, to assist diagnosis. Recently, many deep learning methods have been shown with impressive successes in predicting disease status with raw input data. However, the "black-box" nature of deep learning and the high-reliability requirement of biomedical applications have created new challenges regarding the existence of confounding factors. In this paper, with a brief argument that inappropriate handling of confounding factors will lead to models' sub-optimal performance in real-world applications, we present an efficient method that can remove the influences of confounding factors such as age or gender to improve the across-cohort prediction accuracy of neural networks. One distinct advantage of our method is that it only requires minimal changes of the baseline model's architecture so that it can be plugged into most of the existing neural networks. We conduct experiments across CT-scan, MRA, and EEG brain wave with convolutional neural networks and LSTM to verify the efficiency of our method.

However, CSP is known to be very sensitive to artifacts and prone to overfitting. This paper proposes a novel dynamic time warping (DTW)-based approach to improve CSP covariance matrix estimation and hence improve feature extraction. Dynamic time warping is widely used for finding an optimal alignment between two time-dependent signals under predefined conditions. The proposed approach reduces within class temporal variations and non-stationarity by aligning the training trials to the average of the trials from the same class. The proposed DTW-based CSP approach is applied to the support vector machines (SVM) classifier and evaluated using one of the publicly available motor imagery datasets. The results showed that the proposed approach, when compared to the classical CSP, improved the classification accuracy from 78% to 83% on average. Importantly, for some subjects, the improvement was around 10%.

An endogenous paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for BMI is commonly used for detecting user intention without external stimuli. However, manipulating the dexterous robotic arm by using limited MI commands is challenging issues. In this paper, we designed a shared robotic arm control system using the intuitive MI and vision guidance. To accomplish the user's intention on the robotic arm, we used arm reach MI (left, right, and forward), hand grasp MI, and wrist twist MI by using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The Kinect sensor is used to match the decoded user intention with the detected object based on the location of the workspace. In addition, to decode intuitive MI successfully, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based user intention decoding model. Ten subjects participated in our experiments, and five of them were selected to perform online tasks. The proposed method could decode various user intention (five intuitive MI classes and resting state) with a grand-averaged classification accuracy of 55.91% in offline analysis. For sufficient control on the online shared robotic arm control, the proposed online system was only started, once the patient shows higher performance than 60% in the offline analysis. For the online drinking tasks, we confirmed the averaged 78% success rate. Hence, we confirmed the possibility of the shared robotic arm control based on intuitive BMI and vision guidance with high performance.

Nonetheless, AI is not infallible. Therefore as more task and controls get delegated to AI systems, the implications become dire and riskier (e.g. Google assistant falling to make an emergency call hands-free), which impacts users experience and make users unforgiving towards system failure. Trust can be a key element as it can help overcome the fear of loss and can supports users interactions. Therefore making it important to design methods and tools to foster trust between users and these technologies, especially capable of assessing users trust objectively and serving as an interface applicable in real-time during the interaction. Measuring the psycho-physiological signals of the user provides a way for objective assessment of users trust towards the technology, with the potential for real-time trust assessment, provided that we know the neural correlates of trust. This study aims to show that it is indeed possible to objectively detect users trust level in AI technologies, and provides details on what physiological signals are most suitable for real-time trust detection, as well as details on the predictive machine learning model used. The results show that our model achieved a mean accuracy of 77.8% and mean receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.76.

A great need exists for objective and cost-effective biomarkers for the early detection of MCI. This study uses a sequential imaging oddball paradigm to determine if familiar, unfamiliar, or inverted faces are effective visual stimuli for the early detection of MCI. Unlike the traditional approach where the amplitude and latency of certain deflection points of event-related potentials (ERPs) are selected as electrophysiological biomarkers (or features) of MCI, we used the entire ERPs as potential biomarkers and relied on an advanced machine-learning technique, i.e. an ensemble of sparse classifier (ESC), to choose the set of features to best discriminate MCI from healthy controls. Five MCI subjects and eight age-matched controls were given the MoCA exam before EEG recordings in a sensory-deprived room. Traditional time-domain comparisons of averaged ERPs between the two groups did not yield any statistical significance. However, ESC was able to discriminate MCI from controls with 95% classification accuracy based on the averaged ERPs elicited by familiar faces. By adopting advanced machine-learning techniques such as ESC, it may be possible to accurately diagnose MCI based on the ERPs that are specifically elicited by familiar faces.

Furthermore, we analyzed the same limb movement imagery and its validity in developing multi-class BSI. 15 subject datasets were analyzed using feature extraction and classification methods from regularized common spatial pattern toolbox. The results for offline analysis arc presented in this study. The multiclass analysis was done using One-Versus-One (OVO) and One-Versus-Rest (OVR) approaches using pre-selected feature extraction and classification. OVO and OVR binary classifiers were converted into 4 class classifiers using a novel score based method. Neither lifting nor clenching actions showed any substantial advantage over the other for binary classification. Furthermore, within the same limb, two kinesthetically close actions (lifting vs. clenching) show good differentiability even with the same shared neural pathway. However, further analysis of the performance of the same limb actions in the 4 class environment is required. The same limb movements, if successfully incorporated, shows potential in increasing the number of differentiable classes in a multiclass BSI.

Comprehensive sleep monitoring and analysis using multivariate polysomnography (PSG) records has achieved significant efforts to prevent sleep-related disorders. To alleviate the time consumption caused by manual visual inspection of PSG, automatic multivariate sleep stage classification has become an important research topic in medical and bioinformatics. Results We present a unified hybrid self-attention deep learning framework, namely HybridAtt, to automatically classify sleep stages by capturing channel and temporal correlations from multivariate PSG records. We construct a new multi-view convolutional representation module to learn channel-specific and global view features from the heterogeneous PSG inputs. The hybrid attention mechanism is designed to further fuse the multi-view features by inferring their dependencies without any additional supervision. The learned attentional representation is subsequently fed through a softmax layer to train an end-to-end deep learning model. Conclusions We empirically evaluate our proposed HybridAtt model on a benchmark PSG dataset in two feature domains, referred to as the time and frequency domains. Experimental results show that HybridAtt consistently outperforms ten baseline methods in both feature spaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of HybridAtt in the task of sleep stage classification.

Since Goal-Conflict-Specific-Rhythmicity (GCSR) in the EEG is a sign of an anxiety-related system working, we first propose a two-dimensional Conflict-focused CNN (2-D CNN). It simulates the GCSR extraction process but with the advantages of automatic frequency band selection and functional contrast calculation optimization, thus providing more comprehensive trait anxiety predictions. Then, to generate more targeted hierarchical features from local spatio-temporal scale to global, we propose a three-dimensional Conflict-focused CNN (3-D CNN), which simultaneously integrates information in the temporal and brain-topology-related spatial dimensions. In addition, we embed Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) into our model to reveal the essential brain areas that are correlated to anxious personality. The experimental results show that the percentage variance accounted for by our three-dimensional Conflict-focused CNN is 33%, which is almost four times higher than the previous theoretically derived GCSR contrast (7%). Meanwhile, it also outperforms the 2-D model (26%) and the t-test difference between the 3-D and 2-D models is significant (t(4) = 5.4962,p = 0.0053). What's more, the reverse engineering results provide an interpretable way to understand the prediction decision-making and participants' anxiety personality. Our proposed AnxietyDecoder not only sets a new benchmark for EEG-based anxiety prediction but also reveals essential EEG components that contribute to the decision-making, and thus sheds some light on the anxiety biomarker research.

Prediction of Dyslexia from Eye Movements Using Machine Learning	IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Classification; cross validation; dyslexia; eye tracking; feature extraction; Particle Swarm Optimization; Principal Component Analysis; Support Vector Machine	CHILDREN	Dyslexia is a reading disability and a language disorder where the individual exhibits difficulty in reading, writing, speaking, and trouble in spelling words. Early prediction of dyslexia can help dyslexics to get early support or intervention through remedial teaching. There is no remarkable computational model for the prediction of dyslexia in the literature. Existing methods to diagnose dyslexia include oral and written assessments, analysis and interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), and Electroencephalogram (EEG). These methods require every instance to be interpreted by the domain expert in all stages whereas rigorously trained and tested computational models need subject expert intervention only at the end. In this paper, a prediction model has been proposed that uses statistical methods to differentiate dyslexics from non-dyslexics using their eye movement. The eye movements are tracked with an eye tracker. Eye movement has many features like fixations, saccades, transients, and distortions. From the raw data of eye tracker, high-level features are extracted using Principal Component Analysis. This paper proposes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based Hybrid Kernel SVM-PSO for the prediction of dyslexia in individuals. The proposed model gives better predictive accuracy of 95% compared to a Linear SVM model. The proposed model is validated on 187 subjects by tracking their eye movements while reading. It is observed that eye movement data along with machine learning can be used for building models of high predictive accuracy. The proposed model can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of dyslexia in schools.	[Prabha, A.

Accessing knowledge of the 'here and now': a new technique for capturing electromagnetic markers of orientation processing	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						neuroimaging; neural signal processing; orientation; MEG; ERP; neurotechnology	MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SEMANTIC MEMORY; N400; EEG; COMPONENT; TIME; MEG; ERP; INTEGRATION	Objective. The ability to orient with respect to the current context (e.g. current time or location) is crucial for daily functioning, and is used to measure overall cognitive health across many frontline clinical assessments. However, these tests are often hampered by their reliance on verbal probes (e.g. 'What city are we in?') in evaluating orientation. Objective, physiology-based measures of orientation processing are needed, but no such measures are currently in existence. We report the initial development of potential brainwave-based markers of orientation processing as characterized using electroencephlography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Approach. An auditory stimulus sequence embedded with words corresponding to orientation-relevant (i.e. related to the 'here and now') and orientation-irrelevant (i.e. unrelated to the current context) conditions was used to elicit orientation processing responses. EEG/MEG data, in concert with clinical assessments, were collected from 29 healthy adults. Analysis at sensor and source levels identified and characterized neural signals related to orientation processing. Main results. Orientation-irrelevant stimuli elicited increased negative amplitude in EEG-derived event-related potential (ERP) waveforms during the 390-570ms window (p < 0.05), with cortical activations across the left frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. These effects are consistent with the wellknown N400 response to semantic incongruence. In contrast, ERP responses to orientation-relevant stimuli exhibited increased positive amplitude during the same interval (p < 0.05), with activations across the bilateral temporal and parietal regions. Importantly, these differential responses were robust at the individual level, with machine-learning classification showing high accuracy (89%), sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.90). Significance. This is the first demonstration of a neurotechnology platform that elicits, captures, and evaluates electrophysiological markers of orientation processing. We demonstrate neural responses to orientation stimuli that are validated across EEG and MEG modalities and robust at the individual level. The extraction of physiology-based markers through this technique may enable improved objective brain functional evaluation in clinical applications.

J	Vortmann, LM; Kroll, F; Putze, F				Vortmann, Lisa-Marie; Kroll, Felix; Putze, Felix			EEG-Based Classification of Internally- and Externally-Directed Attention in an Augmented Reality Paradigm	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						internal attention; external attention; EEG; augmented reality; classification; brain-computer interface		One problem faced in the design of Augmented Reality (AR) applications is the interference of virtually displayed objects in the user's visual field, with the current attentional focus of the user. Newly generated content can disrupt internal thought processes. If we can detect such internally-directed attention periods, the interruption could either be avoided or even used intentionally. In this work, we designed a special alignment task in AR with two conditions: one with externally-directed attention and one with internally-directed attention. Apart from the direction of attention, the two tasks were identical. During the experiment, we performed a 16-channel EEG recording, which was then used for a binary classification task. Based on selected band power features, we trained a Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier to predict the label for a 13-s window of each trial. Parameter selection, as well as the training of the classifier, were done in a person-dependent manner in a 5-fold cross-validation on the training data. We achieved an average score of approximately 85.37% accuracy on the test data (+/- 11.27%, range = [66.7%, 100%], 6 participants > 90%, 3 participants = 100%). Our results show that it is possible to discriminate the two states with simple machine learning mechanisms. The analysis of additionally collected data dispels doubts that we classified the difference in movement speed or task load. We conclude that a real-time assessment of internal and external attention in an AR setting in general will be possible.

However, those works are the single subject based classification results with just passable effects. In this study, 20 subjects were visually stimulated to induce motion sickness, and their subjective evaluations (mild, moderate, and severe feelings of MS) were recorded, as well as the EEG, the center of pressure(COP), and the head and waist motion trajectories, followed by extraction of features. The voting classifier utilized four types of base classifiers: 1) K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNN), 2) Logistic Regression (LR), 3) Random Forest (RF) and 4) Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). The averaged accuracy and kappa of the voting classifier were 0.911 and 0.80 across 20 subjects. The multiple subjects binary classification yielded an accuracy of 0.763 and an kappa of 0.52. Multiple subjects three-levels classification refers to the classification of the degree of discomfort associated with motion sickness, with sensitivity values of 0.791/0.504/0.867 and kappa of 0.51, respectively. It is able to detect the Motion Sickness Level (MSL) without interrupting the subjects, which has certain application prospects. For the future use, it can detect the user experience over different VR devices, or the adaptive training process of relevant occupations such as drivers, pilots or astronauts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This work aims to present a deeper investigation of the classification performance achieved by a motor imagery (MI) EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) using functional connectivity (FC) measures as features. The analysis is performed for two different datasets and analytical setups, including an information-theoretic based FC estimator (correntropy). Approach. In the first setup, using data acquired by our group, correntropy was compared to Pearson and Spearman correlations for FC estimation followed by graph-based feature extraction and two different classification strategies?linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and extreme learning machines (ELMs) - coupled with a wrapper for feature selection in the mu (7-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands. In the second setup, the BCI competition IV dataset 2a was considered for a broader comparison. Main results. For our own database the correntropy / degree centrality / ELM approach resulted in the most solid framework, with overall classification error as low as 5%. When using the BCI competition dataset, our best result provided a performance comparable to those of the top three competitors. Significance. Correntropy was shown to be the best FC estimator in all analyzed situations in the first experimental setup, capturing the signal temporal behavior and being less sensitive to outliers. The second experimental setup showed that the inclusion of different frequency bands can bring more information and improve the classification performance. Finally, our results pointed towards the importance of the joint use of different graph measures for the classification.

Due to a high level of noise and non-stationarity inherent in EEG signals, a calibration model trained using limited number of train data may not yield an accurate BCI model. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel subject-to-subject transfer learning framework that improves the classification accuracy using limited training data. The proposed framework consists of two steps: The first step identifies if the target subject will benefit from transfer learning using cross-validation on the few available subject-specific training data. If transfer learning is required a novel algorithm for measuring similarity, called the Jensen-Shannon ratio (JSR) compares the data of the target subject with the data sets from previous subjects. Subsequently, the previously calibrated BCI subject model with the highest similarity to the target subject is used as the BCI target model. Our experimental results using the proposed framework obtained an average accuracy of 77% using 40 subject-specific trials, outperforming the subject-specific BCI model by 3%.

However, its speed is relatively slow compared to P300 and SSVEP paradigms. In order to improve the speed, we proposed a novel bi-directional (leftward and rightward) visual motion BCI paradigm, which decreased the stimulus presentation time of single trial by 50%. Offline experiments were conducted on 5 subjects, which revealed a unique symmetrical spatial and temporal mVEP pattern. The N200 peak of mVEP first appeared on the hemisphere contralateral to the visual motion onset position of stimuli, which reflected the hemisphere transmission delay caused by the optic chiasm. Based on this observation, we developed a BCI system capable of discriminating not only target mVEP responses from non-target ones, but also response to leftward motion from rightward ones. Our new system achieved an averaged AUC 0:93 +/- 0:044 in BCI classification, and an information transfer rate (ITR) boost of 43 +/- 16% over original uni-directional mVEP BCI in offline evaluation. The results demonstrated the capacity of bi-directional visual motion paradigm in doubling the BCI spelling speed, and laid the foundation for a high speed online visual motion BCI.

J	Etard, O; Reichenbach, T				Etard, Octave; Reichenbach, Tobias			Neural Speech Tracking in the Theta and in the Delta Frequency Band Differentially Encode Clarity and Comprehension of Speech in Noise	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						envelope tracking; neural oscillations; speech comprehension; speech processing	CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; INTELLIGIBILITY; ENVELOPE; LANGUAGE; MODULATION; RESPONSES; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Humans excel at understanding speech even in adverse conditions such as background noise. Speech processing may be aided by cortical activity in the delta and theta frequency bands, which have been found to track the speech envelope. However, the rhythm of non-speech sounds is tracked by cortical activity as well. It therefore remains unclear which aspects of neural speech tracking represent the processing of acoustic features, related to the clarity of speech, and which aspects reflect higher-level linguistic processing related to speech comprehension. Here we disambiguate the roles of cortical tracking for speech clarity and comprehension through recording EEG responses to native and foreign language in different levels of background noise, for which clarity and comprehension vary independently. We then use a both a decoding and an encoding approach to relate clarity and comprehension to the neural responses. We find that cortical tracking in the theta frequency band is mainly correlated to clarity, whereas the delta band contributes most to speech comprehension. Moreover, we uncover an early neural component in the delta band that informs on comprehension and that may reflect a predictive mechanism for language processing. Our results disentangle the functional contributions of cortical speech tracking in the delta and theta bands to speech processing. They also show that both speech clarity and comprehension can be accurately decoded from relatively short segments of EEG recordings, which may have applications in future mind-controlled auditory prosthesis.

SEEG-based study in MRI-negative epileptic patients	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; MRI-negative; Focal cortical dysplasia; SEEG; Seizure-onset; Epileptogenic zone	SEIZURE-ONSET PATTERNS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; DIAGNOSTIC METHODS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; BRAIN-TISSUE; TASK-FORCE; SURGERY; STEREOELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; GABA	Objective We aimed to assess stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) seizure-onset and interictal patterns associated with MRI-negative epilepsy and investigate their possible links with histology, extent of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and surgical outcome. Methods We retrospectively analysed a cohort of 59 consecutive MRI-negative surgical candidates, who underwent SEEG recordings followed by cortectomy between 2000 and 2016. Results Most of the eight distinct seizure-onset patterns could be encountered both in confirmed focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and in histologically non-specific or normal cases. We found strong correlation (p = 0.008) between seizure-onset pattern and histology for: (1) slow-wave/DC-shift prior to low voltage fast activity (LVFA), associated with normal/non-specific histology, and (2) bursts of polyspikes prior to LVFA, exclusively observed in FCD. Three interictal patterns were identified: periodic slow-wave/gamma burst, sub-continuous rhythmic spiking and irregular spikes. Both "periodic" patterns were more frequent in but not specific to FCD. Surgical outcome depended on the EZ complete removal, regardless electrophysiological features. Conclusions Histologically normal and FCD-associated epileptogenic zones share distinct interictal and ictal electrophysiological phenotypes, with common patterns between FCD subtypes and between dysplastic and apparently normal brain. Significance Some specific seizure-onset patterns seem to be predictive of the underlying histology and may help to detect an MRI-invisible FCD.

J	Nguyen, CH; Karavas, GK; Artemiadis, P				Nguyen, Chuong H.; Karavas, George K.; Artemiadis, Panagiotis			Adaptive multi-degree of freedom Brain Computer Interface using online feedback: Towards novel methods and metrics of mutual adaptation between humans and machines for BCI	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MOTOR IMAGERY; SPEECH IMAGERY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; RECOGNITION	This paper proposes a novel adaptive online-feedback methodology for Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). The method uses ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) signals and combines motor with speech imagery to allow for tasks that involve multiple degrees of freedom (DoF). The main approach utilizes the covariance matrix descriptor as feature, and the Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) classifier. The novel contributions include, (1) a new method to select representative data to update the RVM model, and (2) an online classifier which is an adaptively-weighted mixture of RVM models to account for the users' exploration and exploitation processes during the learning phase. Instead of evaluating the subjects' performance solely based on the conventional metric of accuracy, we analyze their skill's improvement based on 3 other criteria, namely the confusion matrix's quality, the separability of the data, and their instability. After collecting calibration data for 8 minutes in the first run, 8 participants were able to control the system while receiving visual feedback in the subsequent runs. We observed significant improvement in all subjects, including two of them who fell into the BCI illiteracy category. Our proposed BCI system complements the existing approaches in several aspects. First, the co-adaptation paradigm not only adapts the classifiers, but also allows the users to actively discover their own way to use the BCI through their exploration and exploitation processes. Furthermore, the auto-calibrating system can be used immediately with a minimal calibration time. Finally, this is the first work to combine motor and speech imagery in an online feedback experiment to provide multiple DoF for BCI control applications.

The aim of this study was knowledge about the effect of the EEG-NFB training protocol on the reaction speed of judo athletes and to determine the optimal duration and frequency of training sessions directed at the improvement reaction speed in combat sport athletes. Material and Methods: The study examined 12 male athletes from the national team of the Polish Judo Association. Participants were divided into the experimental (EG, n = 6) and the control group (CG, n = 6). The NFB training protocol was performed and recorded using a Biograf Infiniti 6.0 software and the 5-channel ProComp5 decoding device with an EEG sensor. The effect of NFB training was examined by computer-based simple and complex reaction tests and selected tests of the Vienna Test System (VST). Results: One-way ANOVA showed statistically significant differences between the CG and the EG in theta and beta values after the first and the second cycle of training. There were statistically significant differences between the CG and the EG in the results of reaction speed tests after individual cycles of training. Conclusions: The highest reduction in complex reaction time was obtained after the first training cycle, when training was performed every second day and the highest reduction in simple reaction time was obtained after the second training cycle, when training was performed every day. In both cycle training lasted four minutes.

Medication is the most common treatment for all those suffering from epilepsy, however, this paper introduces the idea of designing an implantable/embedded chip that is to be fed with a machine learning algorithm, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict seizure periods prior to their occurrence to be able to notify the patient or suppress the seizure from happening. Since the system's problem is binary classification between pre-ictal and normal periods, determining the right set of features along with the SVM kernel function is the first step in designing the chip. This paper proposes two tracks, a Linear Features-Linear Kernel combination with a set of time-domain hardware-inexpensive features namely; Coastline, Absolute Mean, Root Mean Square, and Standard Deviation. In addition to the Non-Linear Feature-RBF Kernel combination with another time-domain feature namely; Hurst Exponent. This paper also introduces the concept of segmenting the testing data which showed extremely promising results in the Non-Linear Feature-RBF Kernel combination.

Distinct psychopathology profiles in patients with epileptic seizures compared to non-epileptic psychogenic seizures	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epilepsy; Epileptic seizures; Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; Psychiatric comorbidity; Psychopathology; Machine learning	PERSONALITY-ASSESSMENT INVENTORY; PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; PACKAGE; STRESS; SAMPLE; MMPI; TOOL; EEG	Objective: Similarities in clinical presentations between epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) produces a risk of misdiagnosis. Video-EEG monitoring (VEM) is the diagnostic gold standard, but involves significant cost and time commitment, suggesting a need for efficient screening tools. Methods: 628 patients were recruited from an inpatient VEM unit; 293 patients with ES, 158 with PNES, 31 both ES and PNES, and 146 non-diagnostic. Patients completed the SCL-90-R, a standardised 90-item psychopathology instrument. Bayesian linear models were computed to investigate whether SCL-90-R domain scores or the overall psychopathology factor p differed between groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to investigate the PNES classification accuracy of each domain score and p. A machine learning algorithm was also used to determine which subset of SCL-90-R items produced the greatest classification accuracy. Results: Evidence was found for elevated scores in PNES compared to ES groups in the symptom domains of anxiety (b = 0.47, 95%HDI = [0.10, 0.80]), phobic anxiety (b = 1.32, 95%HDI = [0.98, 1.69]), somatisation (b = 0.84, 95%HDI = [0.49, 1.20]), and the general psychopathology factor p (b = 1.35, 95%HDI = [0.86, 1.82]). Of the SCL-90-R domain scores, somatisation produced the highest classification accuracy (AUC = 0.74, 95%CI = [0.69, 0.79]). The genetic algorithm produced a 6-item subset from the SCL-90-R, which produced comparable classification accuracy to the somatisation scores (AUC = 0.73, 95%CI = [0.64, 0.82]). Significance: Compared to patients with ES, patients with PNES report greater symptoms of somatisation, general anxiety, and phobic anxiety against a background of generally elevated psychopathology. While self-reported psychopathology scores are not accurate enough for diagnosis in isolation, elevated psychopathology in these domains should raise the suspicion of PNES in clinical settings.

In this work, we introduce a flexible and extensible method for transforming clinical time series into new, simpler features that may aid in automated analysis and interpretation. The method is based on information extracted from locally-trained Gaussian Processes. In this work, we describe the procedure, illustrate the idea on contrived data and demonstrate its effectiveness at improving existing methods for both epilepsy detection and activity classification. We show that our feature extraction technique generalizes, and can be used as a preprocessing step for arbitrary machine learning and statistical methods. We further illustrate that the techniques evaluated in our experiments form only a small subset of a very broad class of feature extraction methods on arbitrary data that might form the basis for further study.

However, there has been debate regarding the number of items that can be concurrently represented in this active neural state, which is often called the "focus of attention." Some models propose a strict single-item limit, such that just 1 item can be neurally active at once while other items are relegated to an activity-silent state. Although past studies have decoded multiple items stored in WM, these studies cannot rule out a switching account in which only a single item is actively represented at a time. Here, we directly tested whether multiple representations can be held concurrently in an active state. We tracked spatial representations inWM using alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity, which encodes spatial positions held in WM. Human observers remembered 1 or 2 positions over a short delay while we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data. Using a spatial encoding model, we reconstructed active stimulus-specific representations (channel-tuning functions [CTFs]) from the scalp distribution of alpha-band power. Consistent with past work, we found that the selectivity of spatial CTFs was lower when 2 items were stored than when 1 item was stored. Critically, data-driven simulations revealed that the selectivity of spatial representations in the two-item condition could not be explained by models that propose that only a single item can exist in an active state at once. Thus, our findings demonstrate that multiple items can be concurrently represented in an active neural state.	[Sutterer, David W.; Foster, Joshua J.; Adam, Kirsten C.

J	Chen, ZT; Wang, ZP; Wang, K; Yi, WB; Qi, HZ				Chen, Zhitang; Wang, Zhongpeng; Wang, Kun; Yi, Weibo; Qi, Hongzhi			Recognizing Motor Imagery Between Hand and Forearm in the Same Limb in a Hybrid Brain Computer Interface Paradigm: An Online Study	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Motor imagery; event-related desynchronization (ERD); steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP); hybrid brain-computer interface	SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; STATE; BCI; ORTHOSIS	Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) play an important role in helping to improve and restore the loss of physical function. However, traditional MI-BCIs are limited to the motion intention of gross limb, which places many restrictions on their applications. This study proposes a hybrid paradigm based on MI and the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential, with the aim of improving the spatial resolution of MI recognition. Twelve subjects participated in this study. They performed MI tasks under MI and hybrid conditions. In the MI condition, subjects only performed MI tasks, whereas, in the hybrid condition, they received an electrical stimulus while performing the same tasks. Under the hybrid condition, subjects were required not to pay extra attention to the electrical stimulation. The MI task included imagining clenching the right hand and lifting the right forearm. The classifier was built using the filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm and a support vector machine, and online experiments were used to verify the recognition of two MI tasks. During the online experiments, all subjects were able to output different commands at a recognition accuracy far higher than the random level. The average classification accuracy of the hybrid condition reached 76.39%, with a maximum value of 88.34%, which was about 11% higher than that of the MI condition. Moreover, based on offline data, the classification performance using the event-related desynchronization (ERD) feature under the hybrid condition did not differ significantly from that under the MI condition, indicating that the introduction of electrical stimulation did not interfere in the separability of ERD. The proposed paradigm improved the efficiency of decoding multiple MI locations within a single limb. Despite the introduction of external stimuli, users could still drive the new system in the same way as MI in traditional MI-BCI.

Auditory sensory memory span for duration is severely curtailed in females with Rett syndrome	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; MECP2 DUPLICATION; FREQUENCY; CHILDREN; DEFICITS; DISCRIMINATION; INFORMATION; IMPAIRMENT; EXPRESSION; RECEPTORS	Rett syndrome (RTT), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, is typified by profound cognitive impairment and severe language impairment, rendering it very difficult to accurately measure auditory processing capabilities behaviorally in this population. Here we leverage the mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the event-related potential to measure the ability of Rh patients to decode and store occasional duration deviations in a stream of auditory stimuli. Sensory memory for duration, crucial for speech comprehension, has not been studied in RTT. High-density electroencephalography was successfully recorded in 18 females with Rh and 27 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 6-22 years). Data from seven Rh and three TD participants were excluded for excessive noise. Stimuli were 1 kHz tones with a standard duration of 100 ms and deviant duration of 180 ms. To assess the sustainability of sensory memory, stimulus presentation rate was varied with stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 450, 900, and 1800 ms. MMNs with maximum negativity over fronto-central scalp and a latency of 220-230 ms were clearly evident for each presentation rate in the TD group, but only for the shortest SOA in the Rh group. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant group by SOA interaction. MMN amplitude correlated with age in the TD group only. MMN amplitude was not correlated with the Rett Syndrome Severity Scale. This study indicates that while Rh patients can decode deviations in auditory duration, the span of this sensory memory system is severely foreshortened, with likely implications for speech decoding abilities.

Fast Multiway Partial Least Squares Regression	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electrocorticography; electroencephalography; fast multiway array decomposition; multilinear regression; multiway partial least squares	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; TENSOR DECOMPOSITIONS; P300; APPROXIMATION	Objective: Multiway array decomposition has been successful in providing a better understanding of the structure underlying data and in discovering potentially hidden feature dependences serving high-performance decoder applications. However, the computational cost of multiway algorithms can become prohibitive, especially when considering large datasets, rendering them unsuitable for time-critical applications. Methods: We propose a multiway regression model for large-scale tensors with optimized performance in terms of time complexity, called fast higher order partial least squares (fHOPLS). Results: We compare fHOPLS with its native version, higher order partial least squares (HOPLS), the state-of-the-art in multilinear regression, under different noise conditions and tensor dimensionalities using synthetic data. We also compare their performance when used for predicting scalp-recorded electroencephalography signals from invasively recorded electrocorticography signals in an oddball experiment. For the sake of exposition, we evaluated the performance of standard unfolded partial least squares (PLS) and linear regression. Conclusion: Our results show that fHOPLS is significantly faster than HOPLS, in particular for big data. In addition, the regression performances of fHOPLS and HOPLS are comparable and outperform both unfolded PLS and linear regression. Another interesting result is that multiway array decoding yields more accurate results than epoch-based averaging procedures traditionally used in the brain computer interfacing community.

Value of the most common ictal signs for localization and lateralization of a seizure focus, as well as their sensitivity and specificity for certain focal epilepsies, is well known. All over it, there still remain many signs and poorly described patient behaviours during a seizure whose relation to a seizure focus have yet to be specified and confirmed. Some new signs have been introduced recently but all of them have been based on data provided from just a few dozens of patients. This is no surprise since checking for presence of a specific ictal sign in a patient requires lengthy manual review of video records documenting his/her seizures. We suggest a novel approach toward identification/verification of new ictal signs based on computer supported systematic review of unique extensive dataset of Na Homolce Hospital containing approximately 1.000 seizures (representing data of 400 patients with up to 5 seizures annotated). This requires transforming the original set of patient records into a database consisting of annotated ictal video-EEG recordings in a structured form suitable for statistical analysis as well as for analysis of sequence patterns. This contribution describes our SW tool ASTEP designed and developed for this purpose and demonstrates some properties of ASTEP database, namely advantages of the used seizure description as a sequence of considered ictal signs complemented by detailed information on timing, duration, repetition and mode of appearance of these signs. Finally, some preliminary results are reported.

Supervised Relevance Analysis for Multiple Stein Kernels for Spatio-Spectral Component Selection in BCI Discrimination Tasks	PROGRESS IN PATTERN RECOGNITION, IMAGE ANALYSIS, COMPUTER VISION, AND APPLICATIONS (CIARP 2019)	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	24th Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition (CIARP)	OCT 28-31, 2019	Havana, CUBA	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, Univ Ciencias Informaticas, Cuban Assoc Pattern Recognit				Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) allow direct communication from the human brain to machines by analyzing sensorimotor activity. Within the most common paradigms of cognitive neuroscience for BCI, the Motor Imagery one relies on imaging movement of hands, feet, and tongue, usually. Standard BCI systems make use of electroencephalographic signals due to its high temporal resolution, portability, and easiness to implement. Recently, the filter-banked analysis of common spatial patterns has proved to be among the most discriminative approaches. Nonetheless, such an approach results in high dimensional spaces yielding to overtrained systems, or ill-posed spatial covariance matrices, when the number of EEG sensors increases. In this work, we propose a spatio-spectral relevance analysis, termed Multiple Stein Kernels (MSK), to simultaneously select channels and bands in a supervised criterion, so reducing the spatial and frequency dimension. We test our approach in three known BCI datasets with a varying number of subjects and channels. The attained classification results prove that MKS not only improves the classification accuracy and reduces the dimension of the representation space, but also select frequency bands that are physiologically interpretable.

Recent fMRI decoding studies have suggested that face recognition is supported by identity representations located in regions of the occipitotemporal cortex. Here, we used EEG to elucidate the temporal emergence of these representations. Human participants viewed a set of highly variable face images of 4 highly familiar celebrities (2 males and 2 females), while performing an orthogonal task. Univariate analyses of event-related EEG responses revealed a pronounced differentiation between male and female faces, but not between identities of the same sex. Using multivariate representational similarity analysis, we observed a gradual emergence of face identity representations, with an increasing degree of invariance. Face identity information emerged rapidly, starting shortly after 100 ms from stimulus onset, but was modulated by sex differences and image similarities. From 400 ms after onset and predominantly in the right hemisphere, identity representations showed 2 invariance properties: 1) they equally discriminated identities of opposite sexes and of the same sex, and 2) they were tolerant to image-based variations. These invariant representations may be a crucial prerequisite for successful face recognition in everyday situations, where the appearance of a familiar person can vary drastically.

J	Hejazi, M; Nasrabadi, AM				Hejazi, Mona; Nasrabadi, Ali Motie			Prediction of epilepsy seizure from multi-channel electroencephalogram by effective connectivity analysis using Granger causality and directed transfer function methods	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Effective connectivity; Standard deviation; Granger causality; Directed transfer function; Epilepsy seizure prediction; EEG	SCALP EEG; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; FEATURES; MEG	Epilepsy is a chronic disorder, which causes strange perceptions, muscle spasms, sometimes seizures, and loss of awareness, associated with abnormal neuronal activity in the brain. The goal of this study is to investigate how effective connectivity (EC) changes effect on unexpected seizures prediction, as this will authorize the patients to play it safe and avoid risk. We approve the hypothesis that EC variables near seizure change significantly so seizure can be predicted in accordance with this variation. We introduce two time-variant coefficients based on standard deviation of EC on Freiburg EEG dataset by using directed transfer function and Granger causality methods and compare index changes over the course of time in five different frequency bands. Comparison of the multivariate and bivariate analysis of factors is implemented in this investigation. The performance based on the suggested methods shows the seizure occurrence period is approximately 50 min that is expected onset stated in, the maximum value of sensitivity approaching similar to 80%, and 0.33 FP/h is the false prediction rate. The findings revealed that greater accuracy and sensitivity are obtained by the designed system in comparison with the results of other works in the same condition. Even though these results still are not sufficient for clinical applications. Based on the conclusions, it can generally be observed that the greater results by DTF method are in the gamma and beta frequency bands.

This paper proposed a brain switch based on code-modulated visual-evoked potential (c-VEP), in which seven 8-bit pseudorandom codes were used to modulate the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal.

Among a wide variety of existing TSK fuzzy systems, most of them are driven by special knowledge since the learned parameters of each fuzzy rule are totally different. However, common knowledge is equally important and useful in practice and hence a TSK fuzzy system embedded with common knowledge should be more intuitive and interpretable when tackling with real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a common and special knowledge-driven TSK fuzzy system (CSK-TSK-FS), in which the parameters corresponding to each feature in then-parts of fuzzy rules always keep invariant and these parameters are viewed as common knowledge. As for its modeling, except the gradient descent techniques and other existing training algorithms, we can obtain a trained CSK-TSK-FS from a trained GMM or a trained FLNN because the proposed fuzzy system CSK-TSK-FS is mathematically equivalent to a special GMM and a FLNN. CSK-TSK-FS has three characteristics: (1) with the classical centroid defuzzification strategy, the involved common knowledge can be separated from fuzzy rules such that the interpretability of CSK-TSK-FS can be enhanced; (2) it can be trained quickly by the proposed LLM-based training algorithm; (3) the equivalence relationships among CSK-TSK-FS, GMM and FLNN allow them to share some commonality in training such that the proposed LLM-based training algorithm provides a novel fast training tool for training GMM and FLNN. Experimental results on UCI, KEEL and epileptic EEG datasets demonstrate the promising classification of CSK-TSK-FS.

Methods: 60-channel EEG data of 22 subjects are acquired at wakefulness, light anesthesia and deep anesthesia. The activity of 68 cortical regions are obtained by using EEG source imaging. Sliding window analysis is employed to obtain a dynamic sequence of brain functional network. K-means clustering algorithm is then employed to identify the common brain functional network patterns. Results: Five common brain functional network patterns were identified across all conscious levels. The occurrence of each meta-stable network pattern was associated with the level of anesthesia. A transition functional network pattern was found to transfer to the anesthesia dominating or wakefulness dominating network pattern depending on the conscious level. Furthermore, a functional network pattern persisted during both wakefulness and anesthesia is found to be supported by the anatomical connectivity. Conclusions: Dynamic changes of brain functional network exist in both awaken and anesthesia state. Significance: These findings suggest that dynamic brain functional network analysis plays a critical role in decoding the mechanism of general anesthesia. The obtained five metastable network patterns may be employed for monitoring the depth of anesthesia. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The influence of image masking on object representations during rapid serial visual presentation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							ATTENTIONAL BLINK; MEMORY; RSVP; EVENTS; SPEED; EEG	Rapid image presentations combined with time-resolved multivariate analysis methods of EEG or MEG (rapid-MVPA) offer unique potential in assessing the temporal limitations of the human visual system. Recent work has shown that multiple visual objects presented sequentially can be simultaneously decoded from M/EEG recordings. Interestingly, object representations reached higher stages of processing for slower image presentation rates compared to fast rates. This fast rate attenuation is probably caused by forward and backward masking from the other images in the stream. Two factors that are likely to influence masking during rapid streams are stimulus duration and stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Here, we disentangle these effects by studying the emerging neural representation of visual objects using rapid-MVPA while independently manipulating stimulus duration and SOA. Our results show that longer SOAs enhance the decodability of neural representations, regardless of stimulus presentation duration, suggesting that subsequent images act as effective backward masks. In contrast, image duration does not appear to have a graded influence on object representations. Interestingly, however, decodability was improved when there was a gap between subsequent images, indicating that an abrupt onset or offset of an image enhances its representation. Our study yields insight into the dynamics of object processing in rapid streams, paving the way for future work using this promising approach.

J	Yan, M; Liu, L; Basodi, S; Pan, Y				Yan, Ming; Liu, Ling; Basodi, Sunitha; Pan, Yi			Multi-view learning for benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes	IET COMPUTER VISION			English	Article							CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; MRI; ABNORMALITIES; BECTS; EEG	Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECT) may be the most popular epilepsy to attack children. In recent years, more and more studies have shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are promising techniques in distinguishing BECT patients from healthy controls. However, these existing works have suffered from two limitations. On the one hand, they have paid more attention to the brain changes between BETC and healthy controls than developing machine learning methods that can recognize BECT patients. On the other hand, most of the existing approaches extract hand-crafted features from MRI or fMRI, which cannot obtain the desired performance due to the limited representative capacity of the used features. To address these issues, we propose a novel classification method by fusing the predictions of three different views: hand-crafted features view, MRI view, and fMRI view. The final result is obtained by passing through those predictions after a fusing neural network. The basic idea of our method is that multiple views could provide complementary information and thus can boost the classification performance. Extensive experiments show that the proposed multi-view method is remarkably superior to single-view methods.

Due to this, researchers have proposed several methods aimed at detecting drivers' drowsiness. These methods include subjective, physiological, behavioral, vehicle-based, and hybrid methods. However, recent reports on road safety are still indicating drowsy driving as a major cause of road accidents. This is plausible because the current driver drowsiness detection (DDD) solutions are either intrusive or expensive, thus hindering their ubiquitous nature. This research serves to bridge this gap by providing a test-bed for achieving a non-intrusive and low-cost DDD solution. A behavioral DDD solution is proposed based on tracking the face and eye state of the driver. The aim is to make this research an inception to DDD pervasiveness. To achieve this, National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) Computer Vision Lab's driver drowsiness detection video dataset was utilized. Several video and image processing operations were performed on the videos so as to detect the drivers' eye state. From the eye states, three important drowsiness features were extracted: percentage of eyelid closure (PERCLOS), blink frequency (BF), and Maximum Closure Duration (MCD) of the eyes. These features were then fed as inputs into several machine learning models for drowsiness classification. Models from the K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) machine learning algorithms were experimented. These models were evaluated by calculating their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, miss rate, and false alarm rate values. Although these five metrics were evaluated, the focus was more on getting optimal accuracies and miss rates. The result shows that the best models were a KNN model when k = 31 and an ANN model that used an Adadelta optimizer with 3 hidden layer network of 3, 27, and 9 neurons respective. The KNN model obtained an accuracy of 72.25% with a miss rate of 16.67%, while the ANN model obtained 71.61% and 14.44% accuracy and miss rate respectively.

Recently, the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has led to the discovery of a large number of genes involved in epilepsy. This may improve prompt detection of early-onset epilepsy in neonates. This study aimed at analyzing the genotype-phenotype correlations in neonates with seizures in a bid to improve the understanding of genetic diagnosis of early-onset epilepsy. Clinical features and prognosis of 15 children who underwent genetic testing having had unexplained seizures from February 2016 to May 2018 in Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were analyzed retrospectively. The salient findings were: poor response to stimulus and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) in the initial period were observed in the group with concomitant genetic abnormalities. Despite the recent progress in genetic technology, molecular diagnosis for neonatal-onset epilepsy can be challenging due to genetic and phenotypic heterogeneities. However, some genotypes are associated with specific clinical manifestations and EEG patterns. Therefore, in-depth understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations would be useful to clinicians managing neonates with early-onset seizures. Copyright (C) 2019, Chongqing Medical University.

CP and no-pain (NP) MTT signals collected from 15 young subjects are analyzed in the wavelet packet transformation (WPT) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) domains. In addition, features such as relative energy change, refined composite multiscale dispersion entropy, refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy, and autoregressive model coefficients are extracted in the WPD, VMD, VMDWPD, and WPDVMD domains. Simultaneously, support vector machine (SVM) is selected as the classifier, and feature indexes are input into the classifier by using the 10-fold cross validation method to obtain the best training and test datasets. Principal component analysis is used to reduce the feature dimensions of the training and test datasets and to improve classification accuracy. Then, the test dataset is imported into the trained classifier for the calculation and evaluation of the models classification performance. In the validation of the SVM classifier, feature extraction in the WPDVMD domain is the best pain detection algorithm. It provides high values of sensitivity (91.30), specificity (90.47), positive predictive value (91.30), accuracy (90.90), and area under curve (0.806). The microwave scattering technique can be used as a direct, objective, and experimentally stable method to detect acute CP perception, this approach has a high application prospect for clinical real-time diagnosis.

The classifier used a parallel associative memory based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Each RNN was trained to classify signals belonging to an individual class. A recurrent method based on the application of Lyapunov controlled functions served to design the training procedure of each RNN in the classifier. A parallel structure of RNN with fixed weights (obtained after training process) performed the validation stage. This structure formed a classifier assemble. The selected class assigned to a new segment of EEGI signal is estimated by the minimum value of the least mean square error among the RNNs forming the assemble. The generalization-regularization and a k-fold cross validation (k=5) were the validation methods evaluating the classifier efficiency. The confusion matrix method justified the application of the classification method introduced in this study. The EEGI obtained from two different annotated databases served to test the classifier based on RNNs. The first database contained signals divided in five different classes and collected from patients suffering from epilepsy. The second database has 90 signals divided in three classes that corresponded to EEGI signals corresponding to 3 different visual evoked potentials. The pattern classifier achieved a maximum correct classification percentage of 97.2% using the information of both databases. This value prevailed over results reported in similar studies using the first database. In comparison with other pattern recognition algorithms, the proposed RNNs based classifier attained similar or even better correct classification results.

J	Chen, LL; Zhang, A; Lou, XG				Chen, Lan-lan; Zhang, Ao; Lou, Xiao-guang			Cross-subject driver status detection from physiological signals based on hybrid feature selection and transfer learning	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Driver status; Physiological signals; Cross-subject feature evaluation; Hybrid feature selection; Transfer learning	ADAPTATION REGULARIZATION; STRESS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; MACHINE	It is a challenging and rewarding work for monitoring driving status in daily commute, which is favorable for declining the occurrence of traffic accidents and promoting driver's health. One big challenge that restricts this kind of research from real-life applications is the robustness and transfer ability of learning methods that can effectively tackle individual difference. Drawing knowledge from others through transfer learning could boost detection performance of a new driver. The present study aims to develop an efficient cross-subject transfer learning framework for driving status detection based on physiological signals. To grasp what part of knowledge was appropriate for transferring, cross-subject feature evaluation was used to measure feature quality. Then based on the evaluation score, several filtering algorithms were combined to search for better feature subsets that were not only helpful for later classification tasks but also robust to the individual difference. Finally, the framework based on hybrid feature selection and efficient transfer classifier was validated using simulated and real driving datasets. Our experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm could achieve high recognition accuracy and good transferability among individuals, which could increase the scope of application of physiological data for drive status detection during daily life, as it alleviated the need of subject specific pilot data for assessing the physiological characteristics across subjects. This scheme can be further developed into an online warning and assistant system in vehicles helping to early detect driver's unfavorable status, better manage their negative emotion and decrease the occurrence of traffic accidents.

J	Sumsky, SL; Santaniello, S				Sumsky, Stefan L.; Santaniello, Sabato			Decision Support System for Seizure Onset Zone Localization Based on Channel Ranking and High-Frequency EEG Activity	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Seizure onset zone localization; epilepsy; high frequency oscillations; intracranial EEG; support vector machine classification	OSCILLATIONS 80-500 HZ; HUMAN TEMPORAL-LOBE; FOCAL EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; RESECTION; BRAIN; HFOS; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; AREAS	Interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFO) are a promising biomarker that can help define the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and predict the surgical outcome after the epilepsy surgery. The utility of HFO in planning the surgery, though, is unclear. Reasons include the variability of the HFO across patients and brain regions and the influence of the sleep-wake cycle, which causes large fluctuations in the ratio between the HFO observed in SOZ and non-SOZ regions. To cope with these limitations, a rank-based solution is proposed to identify the SOZ by using the HFO in multichannel intracranial EEG. A time-varying index of the epileptic susceptibility of the different brain areas is derived from the HFO rate and a support vector machine is applied on this index to identify the SOZ. The solution is trained and tested on separate groups of patients to avoid the use of patient-specific information and provides optimal SOZ prediction using as little as 30 min of recordings per channel (window). Tested on 14 patients with various combinations of seizure type, epilepsy etiology, and SOZ arrangement (172.7 +/- 90.1 h/channel per patient and 75.6 +/- 23.5 channels/patient, mean +/- S.D.), our solution identified the SOZ with 0.92 +/- 0.03 accuracy and 0.91 +/- 0.03 area under the ROC curve (mean +/- S.D.) across patients. For each patient, the window onset time was varied over 72 continuous hours and the prediction of the SOZ remained insensitive to the onset time, thus showing potential for surgery planning.
