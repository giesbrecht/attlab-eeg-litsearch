Epileptic activity in neurological deterioration after ischemic stroke, a continuous EEG study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Ischemic stroke; Neurological deterioration; cEEG; Penumbra; Metabolic crisis; Periodic abnormalities	ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; PERIODIC DISCHARGES; CRITICALLY-ILL; NONCONVULSIVE SEIZURES; METABOLIC CRISIS; CARE; HEMORRHAGE; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Objective: Despite improvement in acute stroke care, almost 40% of patients with ischemic stroke present neurological deterioration. Neurological deterioration is associated with higher death and dependency rates. Neurological deterioration mechanisms are unknown, and half of neurological deterioration remains unexplained. We postulate that a substantial proportion of neurological deterioration in ischemic stroke is associated with periodic discharges/non-convulsive seizures that negatively impact the recovery of ischemic stroke and worsen symptoms. Methods: Retrospective review of 24 h continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) performed for neurological deterioration in the stroke unit of a tertiary academic centre. Results: Eighty-one patients were included. cEEG detected epileptic activities in 44% of cases (Nonconvulsive seizures/non-convulsive status epilepticus: 10/81 (12%), periodic discharges: 17/81 (21%) and sporadic epileptiform discharges in 14/81 (17%)). The proportion of patients who did not receive recanalization therapy was significantly higher in the NCSE/NCSz/PDs group than in the group devoid of NCSE/NCSz/PDs: 17/22 (77%) vs 13/59 (22%); p < 0,001. Treatment of Non-convulsive seizures/nonconvulsive status epilepticus and periodic discharges was followed by EEG improvement in respectively 7/8 and 10/16 of treated patients. Conclusions: Non-convulsive seizures/non-convulsive status epilepticus/periodic discharges are associated to neurological deterioration after ischemic stroke. Significance: Treatment of Non-convulsive seizures/non-convulsive status epilepticus and periodic discharges, if such patterns are detected, could help prevent adverse metabolic consequences of epileptic activities on ischemic brain tissue.

Combining frequency and time-domain EEG features for classification of self-paced reach-and-grasp actions	2019 41ST ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)	JUL 23-27, 2019	Berlin, GERMANY				MOTOR IMAGERY	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) might provide an intuitive way for severely motor impaired persons to operate assistive devices to perform daily life activities. Recent studies have shown that complex hand movements, such as reachand-grasp tasks, can be decoded from the low frequency of the electroencephalogram (EEG). In this work we investigated whether additional features extracted from the frequency-domain of alpha and beta bands could improve classification performance of rest vs. palmar vs. lateral grasp. We analysed two multi-class classification approaches, the first using features from the low frequency time-domain, and the second in which we combined the time-domain with frequency-domain features from alpha and beta bands. We measured EEG of ten participants without motor disability which performed self-paced reach-and-grasp actions on objects of daily life. For the timedomain classification approach, participants reached an average peak accuracy of 65 %. For the combined approach, an average peak accuracy of 75 % was reached. In both approaches and for all subjects, performance was significantly higher than chance level (38.1%, 3-class scenario). By computing the confusion matrices as well as feature rankings through the Fisher score, we show that movement vs. rest classification performance increased considerably in the combined approach and was the main responsible for the multi-class higher performance. These findings could help the development of BCIs in real-life scenarios, where decreasing false movement detections could drastically increase the end-user acceptance and usability of BCIs.

In this paper, we propose a novel content-based video emotion tagging approach augmented by users' multiple physiological responses, which are only required during training. Specifically, a better emotion tagging model is constructed by introducing similarity constraints on the classifiers from video content and multiple physiological signals available during training. Maximum margin classifiers are adopted and efficient learning algorithms of the proposed model are also developed. Furthermore, the proposed video emotion tagging approach is extended to utilize incomplete physiological signals, since these signals are often corrupted by artifacts. Experiments on four benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for implicitly integrating multiple physiological responses, and its superior performance to existing methods using both complete and incomplete multiple physiological signals.

However, most methods applied to decode SSVEPs are limited to CCA and some extended CCA-based methods. This study proposed a comparing network based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which was used to learn the relationship between EEG signals and the templates corresponding to each stimulus frequency of SSVEPs. This novel method incorporated prior knowledge and a spatial filter (task related component analysis, TRCA) to enhance detection of SSVEPs. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by comparing it with the standard CCA and other state-of-the art methods for decoding SSVEPs (i.e., CNN and TRCA) on the actual SSVEP datasets collected from 17 subjects. The comparison results indicated that the CNN-based comparing network significantly could significantly improve the classification accuracy compared with the standard CCA, TRCA and CNN. Furthermore, the comparing network with TRCA achieved the best performance among three methods based on comparing network with the averaged accuracy of 84.57% (data length: 2s) and 70.21% (data length: is). The study validated the efficiency of the proposed CNN-based comparing methods in decoding SSVEPs. It suggests that the comparing network with TRCA is a promising methodology for target identification of SSVEPs and could further improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCI system.

A comparison of feature extraction strategies using wavelet dictionaries and feature selection methods for single trial P300-based BCI	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Feature generation and selection; P300	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; COMPETITION 2003; DATA SETS; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; IIB	The P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) is widely used in the implementation of brain computer interfaces (BCI). In this context, one of the main issues to solve is the binary classification problem that entails differentiating between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals with and without P300. Given the particularly unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the single-trial detection scenario, this is a challenging problem in the pattern recognition field. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous experimental studies comparing feature extraction and selection methods for single trial P300-based BCIs using unified criteria and data. In order to improve the performance and robustness of single-trial classifiers, we analyzed and compared different alternatives for the feature generation and feature selection blocks. We evaluated different orthogonal decompositions based on the wavelet transform for feature extraction, as well as different filter, wrapper, and embedded alternatives for feature selection. Accuracies over 75% were obtained for most of the analyzed strategies with a relatively low computational cost, making them attractive for a practical BCI implementation using inexpensive hardware.

This, however, implies that the time necessary to detect the brain signals increases and then that the communication rate can be dramatically reduced. A common approach is then at first to estimate an optimal fixed number of responses to be averaged on a calibration data set and then to use this number on the online/testing dataset. In contrast to this strategy, several early stopping methods have been successfully proposed, aiming at dynamically stopping the stimulation sequence when a certain condition is met. We propose an efficient and easy to implement early stopping method that outperforms the ones proposed in the literature, showing its effectiveness on several publicly available datasets recorded from either healthy subjects or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.

However, causal evidence of brain area activation leading to a behavior is often left missing. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which can temporarily alter brain cortical excitability and activity, is a noninvasive neurophysiological tool used to study causal relationships in the human brain. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technique that produces a more focal current compared to conventional tDCS. Traditionally, the stimulation location has been roughly determined through the 10-20 EEG system, because determining precise stimulation points can be difficult. This protocol uses a 3D digitizer with HD-tDCS to increase accuracy in determination of stimulation points. The method is demonstrated using a 3D digitizer for more accurate localization of stimulation points in the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ).

Neural Activity Reveals Interactions Between Episodic and Semantic Memory Systems During Retrieval	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL			English	Article						free recall; episodic memory; semantic memory; intracranial EEG; machine learning	SPREADING ACTIVATION; DIVIDED ATTENTION; FALSE RECOGNITION; AGE-DIFFERENCES; RECALL; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS; REPRESENTATIONS; DIFFERENTIATION; PERCEPTION	Whereas numerous findings support a distinction between episodic and semantic memory, it is now widely acknowledged that these two forms of memory interact during both encoding and retrieval. The precise nature of this interaction, however, remains poorly understood. To examine the role of semantic organization during episodic encoding and retrieval, we recorded intracranial encephalographic signals as 69 neurosurgical patients studied and subsequently recalled categorized and unrelated word lists. Applying multivariate classifiers to neural recordings, we were able to reliably predict encoding success, retrieval success, and temporal and categorical clustering during recall. By assessing how these classifiers generalized across list types, we identified specific retrieval processes that predicted recall of categorized lists and distinguished between recall transitions within and between category clusters. These results particularly implicate retrieval (rather than encoding) processes in the categorical organization of episodic memories.

It is a brain disorder caused by sudden and unprovoked seizures as a result of excitation of a lot of brain cells simultaneously which may lead to physical symptoms abnormalities and deformation such as failure in concentration, memory, attention etc. therefore, proper and efficient method of continues monitoring and detection of these epileptic seizures is paramount. This work presents an effective and efficient technique suitable for smart, low cost, power and real time devices that can be easily integrated with recent 5G network IoT devices for mobile applications, home and health care centers for monitoring and alert the doctors and patients about its occurrence to prevent a sudden collapse and consciousness which may cause injury and death. We proposed a low computational cost features extraction method by utilizing the efficacy of time-frequency, statistical and non-linear features known as hybrid techniques. The efficiency and accuracy of these smart devices is highly depends on quality of feature extraction methods and classifier performance. Therefore, this work employed two machine learning classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) and feedforward neural network (FFNN) to detect and classify interictal (normal) and ictal (seizure) signals. Discrete wavelet transform (DWI) is employed to decomposes the signals into decomposition levels as sub-bands of the signals to capture the non-stationarity of the EEG signals. Mean, median, maximum, minimum etc. were calculated for each sub-band as statistical parameters, non-linear features such as sample entropy, approximate entropy and wavelet energy were also calculated. The combination of features is then fed to two classifiers for the classification. Based on the performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, our proposed approach reveals a promising result with highest accuracy of 99.6%.

An emotion is a set of reactions and experience to a given conditions, which are modeled as a linear combination of arousal and valence dimensions. Emotional pattern recognition based on physiological signals is a relatively new and fast growing area of research. Several physiological signals such as ECG, EEG, and EMG have been used for emotion recognition. Analysis of Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals is one of the popular technique for emotion state analysis. In this work, an attempt is made to discriminate arousal-valence dimensions using EDA signals and multiscale one dimensional convolution neural network (MCNN). For this, EDA signals are obtained from publically available online DEAP database. These signals are normalized using channel normalization and subjected to MCNN for event-related robust features and classification. K-fold cross validation is used to investigate the performance of classifier. The result shows that the MCNN are able to discriminate the emotional states in arousal/valence dimensions. The proposed approach obtained an overall classification accuracy of 83.75% and 81.25% for arousal and valence scale, respectively. The network yields better classification performance for arousal scale then valence diemension. This might be due to the fact that arousal represent the intensity of emotions. The result also show that the proposed approach is better than the conventional hand-crafted feature based approach. Thus, it appears that the proposed approach can be used to differentiate autonomic and clinical conditions.

The purpose of this review is to summarize information on ambulatory seizure detection, seizure prediction, and status epilepticus prevention. Method: Narrative review. Results: Seizure detection devices are currently under investigation with regards to utility and feasibility in the detection of isolated seizures, mainly in adult patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in long-term epilepsy monitoring units, and occasionally in the outpatient setting. Detection modalities include accelerometry, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electroencephalogram, mattress sensors, surface electromyography, video detection systems, gyroscope, peripheral temperature, photoplethysmography, and respiratory sensors, among others. Initial detection results are promising, and improve even further, when several modalities are combined. Some portable devices have already been U.S. FDA approved to detect specific seizures. Improved seizure prediction may be attainable in the future given that epileptic seizure occurrence follows complex patient-specific non-random patterns. The combination of multimodal monitoring devices, big data sets, and machine learning may enhance patient-specific detection and predictive algorithms. The integration of these technological advances and novel approaches into closed-loop warning and treatment systems in the ambulatory setting may help detect seizures sooner, and tentatively prevent status epilepticus in the future. Conclusions: Ambulatory monitoring systems are being developed to improve seizure detection and the quality of life in patients with epilepsy and their families.

Chronic stress is a common waking experience; however, which specific aspect of sleep is most responsive, and how sleep changes relate to behavioral disturbances and molecular correlates remain unknown. We quantified sleep, physical, endocrine, and behavioral variables, as well as the brain and blood transcriptome in mice exposed to 9 weeks of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Comparing 46 phenotypic variables revealed that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), corticosterone regulation, and coat state were most responsive to UCMS. REMS theta oscillations were enhanced, whereas delta oscillations in non-REMS were unaffected. Transcripts affected by UCMS in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and blood were associated with inflammatory and immune responses. A machine-learning approach controlling for unspecific UCMS effects identified transcriptomic predictor sets for REMS parameters that were enriched in 193 pathways, including some involved in stem cells, immune response, and apoptosis and survival. Only three pathways were enriched in predictor sets for non-REMS. Transcriptomic predictor sets for variation in REMS continuity and theta activity shared many pathways with corticosterone regulation, in particular pathways implicated in apoptosis and survival, including mitochondrial apoptotic machinery. Predictor sets for REMS and anhedonia shared pathways involved in oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. These data identify REMS as a core and early element of the response to chronic stress, and identify apoptosis and survival pathways as a putative mechanism by which REMS may mediate the response to stressful waking experiences.

Researchers have proposed and assessed different ways to measure developers' cognitive load at work and some studies have evaluated the interplay between developers' cognitive load and other attributes such as productivity and software quality. Problem: However, the body of knowledge about developers' cognitive load measurement is still dispersed. That hinders the effective use of developers' cognitive load measurements by industry practitioners and makes it difficult for researchers to build new scientific knowledge upon existing results. Objective: This work aims to pinpoint gaps providing a classification and a thematic analysis of studies on the measurement of cognitive load in the context of software engineering. Method: We carried out a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on well-established guidelines to investigate nine research questions. In total, 33 articles (out of 2,612) were selected from 11 search engines after a careful filtering process. Results: The main findings are that (1) 55% of the studies adopted electroencephalogram (EEG) technology for monitoring the cognitive load; (2) 51% of the studies applied machine-learning classification algorithms for predicting cognitive load; and (3) 48% of the studies measured cognitive load in the context of programming tasks. Moreover, a taxonomy was derived from the answers of research questions. Conclusion: This SMS highlighted that the precision of machine learning techniques is low for realistic scenarios, despite the combination of a set of features related to developers' cognitive load used on these techniques. Thus, this gap makes the effective integration of the measure of developers' cognitive load in industry still a relevant challenge.

Presently, most cancer diagnosis worked according to the visual examination process with effectively. Human visual reviewing of infinitesimal biopsy pictures is exceptionally tedious, subjective, and conflicting due to between and intra-onlooker varieties. In this manner, the malignancy and it's compose will be distinguished in a beginning time for finish treatment and fix. This brain tumor classification system using machine learning-based back propagation neural networks (MLBPNN) causes pathologists to enhance the exactness and proficiency in location of threat and to limit the entomb onlooker variety. Moreover, the technique may assist doctors with analyzing the picture cell by utilizing order and bunching calculations by recoloring qualities of the phones. The different picture preparing steps required for disease location from biopsy pictures incorporate procurement, upgrade, and division; include extraction, picture portrayal, characterization, and basic leadership. In this paper, MLBPNN is analyzed with the help of infra-red sensor imaging technology. Then, the computational multifaceted nature of neural distinguishing proof incredibly diminished when the entire framework is deteriorated into a few subsystems. The features are extracted using fractal dimension algorithm and then the most significant features are selected using multi fractal detection technique to reduce the complexity. This imaging sensor is integrated via wireless infrared imaging sensor which is produced to transmit the tumor warm data to a specialist clinician to screen the wellbeing condition and for helpful control of ultrasound measurements level, especially if there should arise an occurrence of elderly patients living in remote zones.

G.; Ang, Chee Siang			Deep learning analysis of mobile physiological, environmental and location sensor data for emotion detection	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Deep learning; Emotion recognition; Convoltutional neural network; Long short-term memory mobile sensing	RECOGNITION	The detection and monitoring of emotions are important in various applications, e.g., to enable naturalistic and personalised human-robot interaction. Emotion detection often require modelling of various data inputs from multiple modalities, including physiological signals (e.g., EEG and GSR), environmental data (e.g., audio and weather), videos (e.g., for capturing facial expressions and gestures) and more recently motion and location data. Many traditional machine learning algorithms have been utilised to capture the diversity of multimodal data at the sensors and features levels for human emotion classification. While the feature engineering processes often embedded in these algorithms are beneficial for emotion modelling, they inherit some critical limitations which may hinder the development of reliable and accurate models. In this work, we adopt a deep learning approach for emotion classification through an iterative process by adding and removing large number of sensor signals from different modalities. Our dataset was collected in a real-world study from smart-phones and wearable devices. It merges local interaction of three sensor modalities: on-body, environmental and location into global model that represents signal dynamics along with the temporal relationships of each modality. Our approach employs a series of learning algorithms including a hybrid approach using Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-LSTM) on the raw sensor data, eliminating the needs for manual feature extraction and engineering. The results show that the adoption of deep-learning approaches is effective in human emotion classification when large number of sensors input is utilised (average accuracy 95% and F-Measure=%95) and the hybrid models outperform traditional fully connected deep neural network (average accuracy 73% and F-Measure=73%).

Therefore, it might be reasonable to hypothesize correlations and similarities between electrical activities among different parts of the body. Since no works have been found in this direction, the proposed study aimed at overcoming this lack of evidence and seeking analogies between the brain activity and the electrical activity of non-cerebral locations, such as the neck and wrists, to determine if i) cerebral parameters can be estimated from non-cerebral sites, and if ii) non-cerebral sensors can replace cerebral sensors for the evaluation of the users under specific experimental conditions, such as eyes open or closed. In fact, the use of cerebral sensors requires high-qualified personnel, and reliable recording systems, which are still expensive. Therefore, the possibility to use cheaper and easy-to-use equipment to estimate cerebral parameters will allow making some brain-based applications less invasive and expensive, and easier to employ. The results demonstrated the occurrence of significant correlations and analogies between cerebral and non-cerebral electrical activity. Furthermore, the same discrimination and classification accuracy were found in using the cerebral or non-cerebral sites for the user's status assessment.

Modulations in structural and functional MRI were found after only 1 h of BCI training. Two different types of BCI (based on motor imagery or visually evoked potentials) were employed and analyses showed that the brain plastic changes are spatially specific for the respective neurofeedback. This spatial specificity promises tailored therapeutic interventions (e.g. for stroke patients). A brain-computer-interface (BCI) allows humans to control computational devices using only neural signals. However, it is still an open question, whether performing BCI also impacts on the brain itself, i.e. whether brain plasticity is induced. Here, we show rapid and spatially specific signs of brain plasticity measured with functional and structural MRI after only 1 h of purely mental BCI training in BCI-naive subjects. We employed two BCI approaches with neurofeedback based on (i) modulations of EEG rhythms by motor imagery (MI-BCI) or (ii) event-related potentials elicited by visually targeting flashing letters (ERP-BCI). Before and after the BCI session we performed structural and functional MRI. For both BCI approaches we found increased T1-weighted MR signal in the grey matter of the respective target brain regions, such as occipital/parietal areas after ERP-BCI and precuneus and sensorimotor regions after MI-BCI. The latter also showed increased functional connectivity and higher task-evoked BOLD activity in the same areas. Our results demonstrate for the first time that BCI by means of targeted neurofeedback rapidly impacts on MRI measures of brain structure and function. The spatial specificity of BCI-induced brain plasticity promises therapeutic interventions tailored to individual functional deficits, for example in patients after stroke.

The Potential for a Speech Brain-Computer Interface Using Chronic Electrocorticography	NEUROTHERAPEUTICS			English	Review						Electrocorticography (ECoG); Brain-computer interface (BCI); Neural speech decoding; Automatic speech recognition (ASR); Locked-in syndrome (LIS); Communication	DELAYED AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; SURGERY WORK-UP; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; LONG-TERM; EEG; FREQUENCY; EPILEPSY; COMPLICATIONS	A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that uses neural features to restore or augment the capabilities of its user. A BCI for speech would enable communication in real time via neural correlates of attempted or imagined speech. Such a technology would potentially restore communication and improve quality of life for locked-in patients and other patients with severe communication disorders. There have been many recent developments in neural decoders, neural feature extraction, and brain recording modalities facilitating BCI for the control of prosthetics and in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Indeed, ASR and related fields have developed significantly over the past years, and many lend many insights into the requirements, goals, and strategies for speech BCI. Neural speech decoding is a comparatively new field but has shown much promise with recent studies demonstrating semantic, auditory, and articulatory decoding using electrocorticography (ECoG) and other neural recording modalities. Because the neural representations for speech and language are widely distributed over cortical regions spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, the mesoscopic scale of population activity captured by ECoG surface electrode arrays may have distinct advantages for speech BCI, in contrast to the advantages of microelectrode arrays for upper-limb BCI. Nevertheless, there remain many challenges for the translation of speech BCIs to clinical populations. This review discusses and outlines the current state-of-the-art for speech BCI and explores what a speech BCI using chronic ECoG might entail.

Yet, the nature of such representations, their underlying neural mechanisms, and their temporal dynamics await elucidation. Here, we examine summary representations of facial identity in human adults (of both sexes) with the aid of pattern analyses, as applied to EEG data, along with behavioral testing. Our findings confirm the ability of the visual system to form such representations both explicitly and implicitly (i.e., with or without the use of specific instructions). We show that summary representations, rather than individual ensemble constituents, can be decoded from neural signals elicited by ensemble perception, we describe the properties of such representations by appeal to multidimensional face space constructs, and we visualize their content through neural-based image reconstruction. Further, we show that the temporal profile of ensemble processing diverges systematically from that of single faces consistent with a slower, more gradual accumulation of perceptual information. Thus, our findings reveal the representational basis of ensemble processing, its fine-grained visual content, and its neural dynamics.

J	Wendin, G				Wendin, Goran			Can Biological Quantum Networks Solve NP-Hard Problems?	ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						brains; cognition; cognitive science; computational complexity; philosophy of the mind; quantum networks	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; DEFAULT MODE; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; INTEGRATED INFORMATION; CONSCIOUS ACCESS; NEURAL CIRCUITS; EEG-RESPONSES; STATE; COMPLEXITY; DISORDERS	There is a widespread view that the human brain is so complex that it cannot be efficiently simulated by universal Turing machines, let alone ordinary classical computers. During the last decades the question has therefore been raised whether it is needed to consider quantum effects to explain the imagined cognitive power of a conscious mind. Not surprisingly, the conclusion is that quantum-enhanced cognition and intelligence are very unlikely to be found in biological brains. Quantum effects may certainly influence signaling pathways at the molecular level in the brain network, like ion ports, synapses, sensors, and enzymes. This might evidently influence the functionality of some nodes and perhaps even the overall intelligence of the brain network, but hardly give it any dramatically enhanced functionality. The conclusion is that biological quantum networks can only approximately solve small instances of nonpolynomial (NP)-hard problems. On the other hand, artificial intelligence and machine learning implemented in complex dynamical systems based on genuine quantum networks can certainly be expected to show enhanced performance and quantum advantage compared with classical networks. Nevertheless, even quantum networks can only be expected to solve NP-hard problems approximately. In the end it is a question of precision-Nature is approximate.

Recently, it has been shown that expectations can enhance the likelihood that a stimulus is consciously reported, but the neural mechanisms supporting this enhancement are still unclear. We manipulated stimulus expectations within the attentional blink (AB) paradigm using letters and combined visual psychophysics with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings to investigate whether prior expectations may enhance conscious access by sharpening stimulus-specific neural representations. We further explored how stimulus-specific neural activity patterns are affected by the factors expectation, stimulus relevance and conscious report. First, we show that valid expectations about the identity of an upcoming stimulus increase the likelihood that it is consciously reported. Second, using a series of multivariate decoding analyses, we show that the identity of letters presented in and out of the AB can be reliably decoded from MEG data. Third, we show that early sensory stimulus-specific neural representations are similar for reported and missed target letters in the AB task (active report required) and an oddball task in which the letter was clearly presented but its identity was task-irrelevant. However, later sustained and stable stimulus-specific representations were uniquely observed when target letters were consciously reported (decision-dependent signal). Fourth, we show that global pre-stimulus neural activity biased perceptual decisions for a 'seen' response. Fifth and last, no evidence was obtained for the sharpening of sensory representations by top-down expectations. We discuss these findings in light of emerging models of perception and conscious report highlighting the role of expectations and stimulus relevance.

It has traditionally been applied in a wide range of problems that include biological data processing, finance, and intrusion detection systems. In particular, feature selection has been successfully used in medical applications, where it can not only reduce dimensionality but also help us understand the causes of a disease. We describe some basic concepts related to medical applications and provide some necessary background information on feature selection. We review the most recent feature selection methods developed for and applied in medical problems, covering prolific research fields such as medical imaging, biomedical signal processing, and DNA microarray data analysis. A case study of two medical applications that includes actual patient data is used to demonstrate the suitability of applying feature selection methods in medical problems and to illustrate how these methods work in real-world scenarios.

The aim of this study is to propose a recognition system of pedaling motor imagery for lower-limb rehabilitation, which uses unsupervised methods to improve the feature extraction, and consequently the class discrimination of EEG patterns. Approach. After applying a spectrogram based on short-time Fourier transform (SSTFT), both sparseness constraints and total power are used on the time-frequency representation to automatically locate the subject-specific bands that pack the highest power during pedaling motor imagery. The output frequency bands are employed in the recognition system to automatically adjust the cut-off frequency of a low-pass filter (Butterworth, 2nd order). Riemannian geometry is also used to extract spatial features, which are further analyzed through a fast version of neighborhood component analysis to increase the class separability. Main results. For ten healthy subjects, our recognition system based on subject-specific bands achieved mean accuracy of 96.43% +/- 1.56% and mean Kappa of 92.85% +/- 3.12%. Significance. Our approach can be used to obtain a low-cost robotic rehabilitation system based on motorized pedal, as pedaling exercises have shown great potential for improving the muscular performance of post-stroke survivors.

EEG model stability and online decoding of attentional demand during gait using gamma band features	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Attention level; Gait; EEG; Online	PLASTICITY; REHABILITATION; CORTEX; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; ARTIFACTS; RESPONSES; RELEVANT; ALPHA; THETA	Rehabilitation therapies are evolving oriented to improve their performances in terms of functional recovery. To achieve such recovery, the patients' involvement is an important factor that correlates with the plastic properties of the brain. By evaluating electroencephalographic signals, it is possible to modify, in real time, the parameters of the rehabilitation according to the patients' cognitive state. In this paper, an online brain-machine interface to measure the attention level during gait is presented. The system is based on the measurement of selective attention mechanisms manifested as power synchronization and desynchronization in the gamma band. A Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier is used to provide an attention index between 0 and 1 in real time. Robust techniques for artifact rejection and signal standardization are used in order to deal with the problems associated to the measurement of cortical signals during walking. The final interface is validated with 4 incomplete Spinal Cord Injury patients and 4 healthy participants. The system shows an average success rate of 68.1% in the classification of 3 attention levels and a stable behavior of these results during time. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When the stimulus is a single speaker, it is usually assumed that the listener actively attends to and understands the stimulus. However, as the level of attention of the listener is inherently variable, we investigated how this affected neural envelope tracking. Using a movie as a distractor, we varied the level of attention while we estimated neural envelope tracking. We varied the intelligibility level by adding stationary noise. We found a significant difference in neural envelope tracking between the condition with maximal attention and the movie condition. This difference was most pronounced in the right-frontal region of the brain. The degree of neural envelope tracking was highly correlated with the stimulus signal-to-noise ratio, even in the movie condition. This could be due to residual neural resources to passively attend to the stimulus. When envelope tracking is used to measure speech understanding objectively, this means that the procedure can be made more enjoyable and feasible by letting participants watch a movie during stimulus presentation.

Connectivity across frequencies, but most prevalent in alpha/beta, was increased in APOE-epsilon 4 in a set of mostly right-hemisphere connections, including lateral parietal and precuneus regions of the Default Mode Network. Similar regions also demonstrated hyperactivity, but only in gamma (40-160 Hz). In a separate study of AD patients, hypoconnectivity was seen in an extended bilateral network that partially overlapped with the hyperconnected regions seen in young APOE-epsilon 4 carriers. Using machine-learning, AD patients could be distinguished from elderly controls with reasonable sensitivity and specificity, while young APOE-e4 carriers could also be distinguished from their controls with above chance performance. These results support theories of initial hyperconnectivity driving eventual profound disconnection in AD and suggest that this is present decades before the onset of AD symptomology.

Perceptual processing of environmental stimuli induces architectural changes in network topology with higher specialized modules. Evidence shows that, during cognitive tasks, network topology is reconfigured and information is broadcast from modular processors to a connective core, promoting efficient information integration. In this study, we explored how the brain adapts its effective connectivity within the connective core and across behavioral states. We used complex network metrics to identify hubs and proposed a method of classification based on the effective connectivity patterns of information flow. Finally, we interpreted the role of the connective core and each type of hub on the network effectiveness. We also calculated the complexity of electroencephalography microstate sequences across different tasks. We observed that divergent hubs contribute significantly to the network effectiveness and that part of this contribution persists across behavioral states, forming an invariant structure. Moreover, we found that a large quantity of multiple types of hubs may be associated with transitions of functional networks.

To help resolve this debate, we recorded from 17 subjects with intracranial electrodes implanted in face sensitive patches of the fusiform. Multivariate classification analysis showed that facial expression information is represented in fusiform activity and in the same regions that represent identity, though with a smaller effect size. Examination of the spatiotemporal dynamics revealed a functional distinction between posterior fusiform and midfusiform expression coding, with posterior fusiform showing an early peak of facial expression sensitivity at around 180 ms after subjects viewed a face and midfusiform showing a later and extended peak between 230 and 460 ms. These results support the hypothesis that the fusiform plays a role in facial expression perception and highlight a qualitative functional distinction between processing in posterior fusiform and midfusiform, with each contributing to temporally segregated stages of expression perception.

ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM-BASED EMOTION RECOGNITION USING A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK	BULLETIN OF RUSSIAN STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY			Russian	Article						machine learning; artificial neural network; electroencephalogram; emotional state; valence; deep learning; convolutional networks	SELECTION	The existing emotion recognition techniques based on the analysis of the tone of voice or facial expressions do not possess sufficient specificity and accuracy. These parameters can be significantly improved by employing physiological signals that escape the filters of human consciousness. The aim of this work was to carry out an EEG-based binary classification of emotional valence using a convolutional neural network and to compare its performance to that of a random forest algorithm. A healthy 30-year old male was recruited for the experiment. The experiment included 10 two-hour-long sessions of watching videos that the participant had selected according to his personal preferences. During the sessions, an electroencephalogram was recorded. Then, the signal was cleared of artifacts, segmented and fed to the model. Using a neural network, we were able to achieve a F1 score of 87%, which is significantly higher than the F1 score for a random forest model (67%). The results of our experiment suggest that convolutional neural networks in general and the proposed architecture in particular hold great promise for emotion recognition based on electrophysiological signals. Further refinement of the proposed approach may involve optimization of the network architecture to include more classes of emotions and improvement of the network's generalization capacity when working with a large number of participants.

Artificial Intelligence based prediction of seizures for Epileptic Patients: IoT based Cost effective Solution	2019 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICOICT)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICOICT)	JUL 24-26, 2019	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	IEEE, Multimedia Univ Malaysia, Telkom Univ Indonesia		Modified cuckoo search; seizures; epilepsy; Artificial Intelligence; Cost effective		Epilepsy prediction in epileptic patients are considered as the most crucial issue since decades. According to the world health organization (WHO) around fifty million people are suffering from epilepsy which is caused by the neurological disorder. Sudden and abrupt seizures are acknowledged as epilepsy. Seventy percent of the epileptic patients belong to the lower and middle-class countries. Seizures are very complex to predict as they are very sudden and it is very hard to discriminate the neurological signals. Seizures are due to the redundant discharge of electrical signals from brain cells. Several artificial intelligence based and deep learning based methodologies have been applied to detect seizures as they are dangerous to the growth of the brain. Classification and patterns of brain signals were classified using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain has also been performed to identify the flash floods. The identification of seizures in hospitals is acknowledged as expensive as the EEG signals and MRI testing equipment are very costly. According to the WHO mostly the epileptic patients belong to the poor countries therefore a cost-effective solution is needed. Seventy percent of the epileptic patients can live a normal life if it was properly diagnosed and treated. In this research paper a novel cost-effective solution has been presented for the vigorous prediction of the seizures in epileptic patients. Several methodologies and case studies have been studied by researchers but cannot be acknowledged as cost-effective as researchers used EEG and MRI signals. In this research paper a cost-effective hardware model has been designed and Modified cuckoo search has been applied to predict the seizures. Results have proved that the proposed research can be acknowledged as cost effective solution with higher accuracy and less false alarm rate.

Epilepsy is marked by intermittent seizures, the detection of which can be a challenging problem. Therefore, reliably detecting the onset of seizures has evoked the interest of researchers over the last few years. Major leaps in the domain of machine learning, signal processing methods, and computational capabilities have made it a tractable task. In this paper, we apply multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition (MRDMD), which is a data-driven dimensionality reduction technique, on the problem of epileptic seizure detection. This method can effectively separate a complex non-linear system into a collection of time-scale components at different resolutions. We have applied this algorithm on two different scalp EEG datasets, i.e., CHB-MIT and KU Leaven datasets. We have applied necessary post-processing steps to reduce the false alarm rate and boost the sensitivity and specificity. A detailed analysis of the results has been presented for the proposed method applied to both the datasets. The algorithm achieves a sensitivity of 0.937 and 0.96, a specificity of 0.99 and 0.99, a false alarm rate of 0.587 and 0.413 per hour, and a latency of 3.12 and 2.75 s for CHB-MIT and KU Leuven, respectively. The results indicate that the multi-resolution analysis yields a significant improvement in sensitivity compared with the basic dynamic mode decomposition.

J	Razi, S; Mollaei, MRK; Ghasemi, J				Razi, Sara; Mollaei, Mohammad Reza Karami; Ghasemi, Jamal			A novel method for classification of BCI multi-class motor imagery task based on Dempster-Shafer theory	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Dempster-Shafer theory; Brain-computer interfaces; Common spatial patterns; Multi-class; Motor imagery	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; INFORMATION FUSION; UNCERTAINTY; FILTERS; ENSEMBLE; PATTERNS; SETS	Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a promising technology to help disabled people to interact with the world only through their brain signals. These systems are designed based on recognizing the patient's intention by processing his brain signal measurements. The essence of Motor-Imagery (MI) BCI systems is to train a model which classifies the brain signals into several major motions using several training sessions. Current methods mainly employ common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm to extract meaningful features from the brain signals. Since the CSP algorithm primarily is designed for a two-class paradigm, often data fusion techniques are used to combine the results of CSP-based binary classifiers in multi-class problems. Noting the critical drawback of current data fusion methods due to losing information when combining the results of binary classifiers, here we propose a novel method based on Dempster-Shafer theory to fuse the results of constituent binary classifiers. We applied the proposed method to the benchmark BCI competition iv set 2a data set. The results show a significant improvement, which prove success of our method in modeling uncertainty. More specifically, the average kappa value is 75% which is higher than other competing methods. The proposed method is general and applicable to a wide range of applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns can be difficult to interpret, and the absence of an EEG correlate does not rule out the diagnosis of NCSE. In this setting, neuroimaging tools to help in the diagnosis are crucial. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and quantitative HMPAO-SPECT (QtSPECT) in patients with clinical suspicion of NCSE, and to evaluate their value in the final diagnosis of NCSE. Methods: We recruited consecutive patients admitted in our center with suspicion of NCSE, and selected those who underwent an HMPAO-SPECT. All patients were admitted to the neurology ward and underwent an EEG. We divided the patients into those who were finally with diagnosed NCSE (NCSE-p) and those who were not (non-NCSE) according to the Salzburg Diagnostic EEG criteria. Sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tools were calculated. The SPECTs were acquired in a Skylight SPECT (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam). The injections were done during the clinical episode suspected of being an NCSE. The HMPAO-SPECT was analyzed by two experts and was also quantified. All data were normalized to the SPM SPECT template. We used an external healthy normal database to obtain a Z-score map for each individual versus the normal database. The Z-score maximum (Z(max)) was extracted from each region of the AAL atlas as was the percentage of voxels with a Z-score higher than 2.5 (N(%)). A logistic regression combining the Z(max), N(%), and the effect of patient age was fitted to predict the final NCSE diagnosis. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the classification performance. Results: We included 55 patients, 21 of them women (38.9%), with a median age of 62.1 years old (range 25-84). Thirty-six patients were with diagnosed NCSE (62.9%). Initial EEG had a sensitivity of 61.1% and a specificity of 89%. Most of the patients were critically ill with diagnostic difficulties, and it could be one of the main reasons to find low sensitivity of the Salzburg diagnostic EEG criteria. The Zmax and N(%) were significantly higher in NCSE-p than in non-NCSE (p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). The HMPAO-SPECT qualitative analysis had a sensitivity of 80.5% and specificity of 89.5% while QtSPECT had a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 81%. Conclusion: Both 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT and QtSPECT can be useful in the diagnosis of NCSE.

It has been increasingly used in neuroscience because of its ability to detect unknown non-linear interactions, which makes it well suited for exploratory brain effective connectivity analyses. Like all information theoretic quantities, TE is defined regarding the probability distributions of the system under study, which in practice are unknown and must be estimated from data. Commonly used methods for TE estimation rely on a local approximation of the probability distributions from nearest neighbor distances, or on symbolization schemes that then allow the probabilities to be estimated from the symbols' relative frequencies. However, probability estimation is a challenging problem, and avoiding this intermediate step in TE computation is desirable. In this work, we propose a novel TE estimator using functionals defined on positive definite and infinitely divisible kernels matrices that approximate Renyi's entropy measures of order alpha. Our data-driven approach estimates TE directly from data, sidestepping the need for probability distribution estimation. Also, the proposed estimator encompasses the well-known definition of TE as a sum of Shannon entropies in the limiting case when alpha -> 1. We tested our proposal on a simulation framework consisting of two linear models, based on autoregressive approaches and a linear coupling function, respectively, and on the public electroencephalogram (EEG) database BCI Competition IV, obtained under a motor imagery paradigm. For the synthetic data, the proposed kernel-based TE estimation method satisfactorily identifies the causal interactions present in the data. Also, it displays robustness to varying noise levels and data sizes, and to the presence of multiple interaction delays in the same connected network. Obtained results for the motor imagery task show that our approach codes discriminant spatiotemporal patterns for the left and right-hand motor imagination tasks, with classification performances that compare favorably to the state-of-the-art.

There are so many experiences a visually impaired person fails to witness in his/her life, the colors, the imagery, faces of their loved ones and many more. So many visually impaired people go through the course of their life without ever witnessing a vision of a smile or happiness in the eyes of their loved ones. Encountering instances of smiling faces of loved ones bring out an inner joy in every being's soul. Warmth of a smile and glee of happiness can only be felt truly if shared with a loved one. In an effort to aid visually impaired people feel this warmth and help them experience a fulfilled version of life, a template emotion detection system is proposed. This model attempts to bridge the emotional gap between a visually impaired individual and his/her adored one by utilizing a wearable to impart the sentiments of bliss and happiness. For the scope of this system, the visually impaired individual as our essential subject and are on the other hand utilizing the word - primary subject alternatively is being considered. Elaborately, this wearable recognizes the electrical activity in a third individual's cerebrum and predicts utilizing machine learning the happy quotient and buzzes the primary subject's wearable identifying vicinity and context in the surroundings at whatever point the third person smiles or is happy with regards to that conversation. This paper intends to outline a reasonable template for discovery of electrical activity in the third person's brain and detect pleasant feelings in him/her utilizing a headgear to notify the primary subject of a pleasant/happy feeling in other individual's mind trying to enhance nature of discussions and thus improve quality of life.

To tackle this problem, we use a limited labelled set and a relatively large unlabelled set from the same subject for training based on the transductive support vector machine (TSVM) framework. We first introduce an improved TSVM (ITSVM) method, in which a comprehensive feature of each sample consists of its common spatial patterns (CSP) feature and its geometric feature. Moreover, we use the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) to solve the optimization problem of TSVM under a new balancing constraint that can address the unknown distribution of the unlabelled set by considering various possible distributions. In addition, we propose an improved self-training TSVM (IST-TSVM) method that can iteratively perform CSP feature extraction and ITSVM classification using an expanded labelled set. Extensive experimental results on dataset IV-a from BCI competition III and dataset II-a from BCI competition IV show that our algorithms outperform the other competing algorithms, where the sizes and distributions of the labelled sets are variable. In particular, IST-TSVM provides average accuracies of 63.25% and 69.43% with the abovementioned two datasets, respectively, where only four positive labelled samples and sixteen negative labelled samples are used. Therefore, our algorithms can provide an alternative way to reduce the calibration time.

The representational dynamics of visual objects in rapid serial visual processing streams	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							CATEGORY REPRESENTATIONS; LEVEL CATEGORIZATION; TEMPORAL CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; PATTERNS; ANIMACY; ORGANIZATION; POPULATION	In our daily lives, we are bombarded with a stream of rapidly changing visual input. Humans have the remarkable capacity to detect and identify objects in fast-changing scenes. Yet, when studying brain representations, stimuli are generally presented in isolation. Here, we studied the dynamics of human vision using a combination of fast stimulus presentation rates, electroencephalography and multivariate decoding analyses. Using a presentation rate of 5 images per second, we obtained the representational structure of a large number of stimuli, and showed the emerging abstract categorical organisation of this structure. Furthermore, we could separate the temporal dynamics of perceptual processing from higher-level target selection effects. In a second experiment, we used the same paradigm at 20Hz to show that shorter image presentation limits the categorical abstraction of object representations. Our results show that applying multivariate pattern analysis to every image in rapid serial visual processing streams has unprecedented potential for studying the temporal dynamics of the structure of representations in the human visual system.

EEG Analysis of the Music Effect on Lecture Comprehension	2019 IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SYMPOSIUM (SPMB)	IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium (SPMB)	DEC 07, 2019	Temple Univ, Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Philadelphia, PA	IEEE, Neural Engn Data Consortium, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Reg 2, Signal Proc Soc Philadelphia Sect	Temple Univ, Sci Educ & Res Ctr		BACKGROUND MUSIC	Human concentration depends on many volatile environmental factors and its quantification has been a recurrent research topic. One way to quantify concentration is to record and analyze electrical activity in the cerebral cortex. Music is one factor that significantly influences concentration, both positively and negatively, so we studied the influence of music on the electrical activity generated by the frontal lobe during lecture comprehension. Sixteen subjects were recruited to carry out a lecture with or without music. Frontal lobe electrical activity was recorded during the readings. After each reading, a brief test was applied to quantify the level of lecture comprehension. Subsequently, cortical electrical signals were processed in two frequency bands: alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz). Our results suggest that individuals tend to increase their level of lecture comprehension when listening to their favorite music, reflecting a higher level of attention and better focus during the reading decoding process.

Cognitive and Physiological Measures in Well-Being Science: Limitations and Lessons	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						positive affect; negative affect; well-being; interventions; prosocial behavior; cognition; EEG; physiology	LOVING-KINDNESS MEDITATION; FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; LIFE-EVENTS; SUBJECTIVE HAPPINESS; EMOTION RECOGNITION; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; BRAIN ASYMMETRY; BASIC EMOTIONS; SELF-REPORTS	Social and personality psychology have been criticized for overreliance on potentially biased self-report variables. In well-being science, researchers have called for more "objective" physiological and cognitive measures to evaluate the efficacy of well-being-increasing interventions. This may now be possible with the recent rise of cost-effective, commercially available wireless physiological recording devices and smartphone-based cognitive testing. We sought to determine whether cognitive and physiological measures, coupled with machine learning methods, could quantify the effects of positive interventions. The current 2-part study used a college sample (N = 245) to contrast the cognitive (memory, attention, construe!) and physiological (autonomic, electroencephalogram) effects of engaging in one of two randomly assigned writing activities (i.e., prosocial or "antisocial"). In the prosocial condition, participants described an interaction when they acted in a kind way, then described an interaction when they received kindness. In the "antisocial" condition, participants wrote instead about an interaction when they acted in an unkind way and received unkindness, respectively. Our study replicated previous research on the beneficial effects of recalling prosocial experiences as assessed by self-report. However, we did not detect an effect of the positive or negative activity intervention on either cognitive or physiological measures. More research is needed to investigate under what conditions cognitive and physiological measures may be applicable, but our findings lead us to conclude that they should not be unilaterally favored over the traditional self-report approach.

While several studies have suggested a role for frontal brain areas in enhancing task-related representations in visual cortices, especially in the lateral-occipital cortex, they have remained silent about the type of information transferred to visual areas. However, the recently developed methods of representational connectivity analysis, allowed us to track the movement of different types of information in the brain. Accordingly, we designed an EEG object detection experiment and inspected the spatiotemporal dynamics of category- and target-related information across the brain. Results showed that the prefrontal area initiated the processing of target-related information. This information was then transferred to posterior brain areas during stimulus presentation probably to facilitate object detection and to direct the decision-making procedure. We also observed that, as compared to category-related information, the target-related information could predict the behavioral performance more accurately, suggesting the dominant representation of internal compared to external information in brain signals. These results provided new evidence about the role of prefrontal cortices in the processing of task-related information in the brain during object detection.

For such a reason, accurate measurements of stress level can be helpful to provide mechanisms for prevention and treatment. This paper proposes a procedure for the classification of different mental stress levels by using physiological signals provided by low invasive wearable devices. 17 healthy volunteers participated in this study. Three different mental states were elicited in them: a resting condition, a stressful cognitive state, and a sustained attention task. The acquired physiological signals were: a one lead electrocardiogram (ECG), a respiratory signal, a blood volume pulse (BVP), and 14 channels of a 10-20 electroencephalogram (EEG). For all subjects, 59 time series of 300 samples each were structured by including the RR series, the respiratory series, the pulse arrival time (PAT) series, and the delta, theta, alpha, beta power series of the 14 EEG channels. Different classifiers were implemented to assess the mental stress level starting from a pool of 3481 features computed from the aforementioned physiological quantities, using the Network Physiology paradigm. The highest achieved accuracy was 84.6%, from logistic regression and random forest classifiers, cross validated by mean of leave-one-person-out analysis. A further analysis was carried out to evaluate the classification accuracy using only cardio-respiratory signals, since the latter are more suitable to be used in real-life scenarios. In this case, the highest achieved accuracy was 76.5% obtained by the random forest classifier.

Systematic extraction of individual slow waves is not trivial. New method: In this study, we used the neural network pattern recognition to detect individual slow waves in LFP recorded from mice as well as other commonly used methods that are based on fast frequencies modulation, amplitude, or duration. Results: The number and quality of events detected as slow waves depended on the chosen method of detection, level of thresholds, or on combination of methods. Each individual method yields some false-positive and false-negative detections. Typically, the fast frequency-method has a higher false discovery rate, but almost no missing waves; amplitude-based method has relatively high false-positive and false-negative rates; duration-based method has low false-negative rates; neural network pattern recognition approach has the lowest false-positive rate among individual methods, often rejecting waves that were falsely detected by other approaches. Combining all 4 detection methods practically eliminated false-positive errors, but a large number of slow waves remained undetected. Conclusions: The use of a particular method of slow wave detection needs to be adjusted to the objectives of a given study: to detect all slow waves, but also numerous false positives can be achieved using the fast frequency approach. Neural network pattern recognition method alone can detect slow waves with the lowest false-positive rate, that can be further minimized with the use of combination of other methods.

Finding the P3 in the P600: Decoding shared neural mechanisms of responses to syntactic violations and oddball targets	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						ERP; Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA); Language; Syntax; P3; P600; Domain specificity	BRAIN POTENTIALS; FACE PERCEPTION; POSITIVE SHIFT; LANGUAGE; SPECIFICITY; TUTORIAL; DYNAMICS; LATENCY; REVEAL; MEMORY	The P600 Event-Related Brain Potential, elicited by syntactic violations in sentences, is generally interpreted as indicating language-specific structural/combinatorial processing, with far-reaching implications for models of language. P600 effects are also often taken as evidence for language-like grammars in non-linguistic domains like music or arithmetic. An alternative account, however, interprets the P600 as a P3, a domain-general brain response to salience. Using time-generalized multivariate pattern analysis, we demonstrate that P3 EEG patterns, elicited in a visual Oddball experiment, account for the P600 effect elicited in a syntactic violation experiment P3 pattern-trained MVPA can classify P600 trials just as well as P600-trained ones. A second study replicates and generalizes this finding, and demonstrates its specificity by comparing it to face- and semantic mismatch-associated EEG responses. These results indicate that P3 and P600 share neural patterns to a substantial degree, calling into question the interpretation of P600 as a language-specific brain response and instead strengthening its association with the P3. More generally, our data indicate that observing P600-like brain responses provides no direct evidence for the presence of language-like grammars, in language or elsewhere.

There are very few BCI studies based on these mobile devices and, to the best of our knowledge, none of them supports networking applications or are focused on an assistive context, failing to test their systems with motor-disabled users. Therefore, the aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to design and develop an asynchronous P300-based BCI system that allows users to control Twitter and Telegram in an Android device; and (ii) to test the usefulness of the developed system with a motor-disabled population in order to meet their daily communication needs. Row-col paradigm (RCP) is used in order to elicitate the P300 potentials in the scalp of the user, which are immediately processed for decoding the user's intentions. The expert system integrates a decision-making stage that analyzes the attention of the user in real-time, providing a comprehensive and asynchronous control. These intentions are then translated into application commands and sent via Bluetooth to the mobile device, which interprets them and provides visual feedback to the user. During the assessment, both qualitative and quantitative metrics were obtained, and a comparison among other state-ofthe-art studies was performed as well. The system was tested with 10 healthy control subjects and 18 motor-disabled subjects, reaching average online accuracies of 92.3% and 80.6%, respectively. Results suggest that the system allows users to successfully control two socializing features of a smartphone, bridging the accessibility gap in these trending devices. Our proposal could become a useful tool within households, rehabilitation centers or even companies, opening up new ways to support the integration of motor-disabled people, and making an impact in their quality of life by improving personal autonomy and self-dependence.

Thus, ensuring the reliability of the decisions becomes essential in biomedical applications, while representing a major challenge considering battery-powered wearable technologies. Transferring the complex and energy-consuming computations to fogs or clouds can significantly reduce the energy consumption of wearable devices and result in a longer lifetime of these systems with a single battery charge. In this work, we aim to distribute the complex and energy-consuming machine-learning computations between the edge, fog, and cloud, based on the notion of self-awareness that takes into account the complexity and reliability of the algorithm.

Telepresence is a subfield of the robotic-assisted route, where human plays the role of an operator, sending high-level instructions to an as sistive robot while receiving sensory feedback. However, for severely motor-impaired people, conventional interaction modalities may not be suitable due to their complete paralysis. Thus, designing alternative ways of interaction such as Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) is essential for a telepresence capability. We propose a novel framework that integrates a BCI system and a humanoid robot to develop a brain-controlled telepresence system with multimodal control features. In particular, the low-level control is executed by Programming by Demonstration (PbD) models, and the higher-level cognitive commands are produced by a BCI system to perform vital ADLs. The presented system is based on real-time decoding of attention-modulated neural responses elicited in the brain electroencephalographic signals and generating multiple control commands. As a result, the system allows a user to interact with a humanoid robot while receiving auditory and visual feedback from the robot's sensors. We validated our system across ten subjects in a realistic scenario. The experimental results show the feasibility of the approach in the design of a telepresence robot with high BCI decoding performances.

To achieve seizure freedom without side effects, accurate localization of the epileptogenic tissue is crucial before its resection. We investigate an automated, fast, objective mapping process that uses only interictal data. Methods: We propose a novel approach based on multiple iEEG features, which are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) model for classification of iEEG electrodes as normal or pathologic using 30 min of inter-ictal recording. Results: The tissue under the iEEG electrodes, classified as epileptogenic, was removed in 17/18 excellent outcome patients and was not entirely resected in 8/10 poor outcome patients. The overall best result was achieved in a subset of 9 excellent outcome patients with the area under the receiver operating curve = 0.95. Conclusion: SVM models combining multiple iEEG features show better performance than algorithms using a single iEEG marker. Multiple iEEG and connectivity features in presurgical evaluation could improve epileptogenic tissue localization, which may improve surgical outcome and minimize risk of side effects. Significance: In this study, promising results were achieved in localization of epileptogenic regions by SVM models that combine multiple features from 30 min of inter-ictal iEEG recordings.

J	Parhi, KK; Zhang, ZS				Parhi, Keshab K.; Zhang, Zisheng			Discriminative Ratio of Spectral Power and Relative Power Features Derived via Frequency-Domain Model Ratio With Application to Seizure Prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Time-series; ratio of band power; relative band power; discriminability; frequency-domain model ratio (FDMR); auto-regressive model; prediction error filter; seizure prediction; classification	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; EEG; ONSET; SERIES; SIGNAL; DECOMPOSITION; ARCHITECTURES; PATTERNS; SYSTEM; FFT	The ratio of spectral power in two different bands and relative band power have been shown to be sometimes more discriminative features than the spectral power in a specific band for binary classification of a time series for seizure prediction. However, why and which ratio of spectral power and relative power features are better discriminators than a band power have not been understood. While general answers to why and which are difficult, this paper partially addresses the answer to these questions. Using auto-regressive modeling, this paper, for the first time, theoretically explains that for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases, the ratio features may sometime amplify the discriminability of one of the two states in a time series, as compared with a band power. This paper, also for the first time, introduces a novel frequency-domain model ratio (FDMR) that can be used to select the two frequency bands. The FDMR computes the ratio of the frequency responses of the two auto-regressive model filters that correspond to two different states. It is shown that the ratio implicitly cancels the effect of change of variance of the white noise that is input to the auto-regressive model in a non-stationary environment for high SNR conditions. It is also shown that under certain sufficient but not necessary conditions, the ratio of the spectral power and the relative band power, i.e., the band power divided by the total power spectral density, can be better discriminators than band power. Synthesized data and scalp EEG data from the MIT Physionet for patient-specific seizure prediction are used to explain why the ratios of spectral power obtained by a ranking algorithm in the prior literature satisfy the sufficient conditions for amplification of the ratio feature derived in this paper.

Event-related responses are broadly categorized into evoked and induced responses, but those are analyzed commonly in the time and the time-frequency domain, respectively. To facilitate a comparison of evoked and induced responses, a unified method for analyzing both evoked and induced responses is desired. Here we propose a method of cross-correlation task-related component analysis (xTRCA) as an extension of our previous method. xTRCA constructs a linear spatial filter and then optimizes trial timings of single trials based on trial reproducibility as an objective function. The spatial filter enhances event-related responses, and the temporal optimization compensates trial-by-trial latencies that are inherent to ERPs. We first applied xTRCA to synthetic data of induced responses whose phases varied from trial to trial, and found that xTRCA could realign the induced responses by compensating the phase differences. We then demonstrated with mismatch negativity data that xTRCA enhanced the event-related-potential waveform observed at a single channel. Finally, a classification accuracy was improved when trial timings were optimized by xTRCA, suggesting a practical application of the method for a brain computer interface. We conclude that xTRCA provides a unified framework to analyze and enhance event-related evoked and induced responses in the time domain by objectively maximizing trial reproducibility.

JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Intracranial EEG; Physiology; Noise removal; Multivariate; Episodic memory	FREQUENCY GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY FORMATION; THETA; CORTEX; STIMULATION; RECORDINGS; DISTANCE; RECALL; POWER	Background: Neuroscientists routinely seek to identify and remove noisy or artifactual observations from their data. They do so with the belief that removing such data improves power to detect relations between neural activity and behavior, which are often subtle and can be overwhelmed by noise. Whereas standard methods can exclude certain well-defined noise sources (e.g., 50/60 Hz electrical noise), in many situations there is not a clear difference between noise and signals so it is not obvious how to separate the two. Here we ask whether methods routinely used to "clean" human electrophysiological recordings lead to greater power to detect brain behavior relations. New method: This, to the authors' knowledge, is the first large-scale simultaneous evaluation of multiple commonly used methods for removing noise from intracranial EEG recordings. Results: We find that several commonly used data cleaning methods (automated methods based on statistical signal properties and manual methods based on expert review) do not increase the power to detect univariate and multivariate electrophysiological biomarkers of successful episodic memory encoding, a well-characterized broadband pattern of neural activity observed across the brain. Comparison with existing methods: Researchers may be more likely to increase statistical power to detect physiological phenomena of interest by allocating resources away from cleaning noisy data and toward collecting more within-patient observations. Conclusions: These findings highlight the challenge of partitioning signal and noise in the analysis of brain-behavior relations, and suggest increasing sample size and numbers of observations, rather than data cleaning, as the best approach to improving statistical power.

In this study, we addressed the question if and how preparing to ignore an anticipated distractor differs from preparing for an anticipated target. We measured EEG while participants memorized a laterally presented color, which was cued to be either a target or a distractor in two subsequent visual search tasks. Decoding the location of items in the search display from EOG channels revealed that, initially, the anticipated distractor attracted attention and could only be ignored later during the trial. This suggests that distractors could not be suppressed in advance but were represented in an active, attention-guiding format. Consistent with this, lateralized posterior alpha power did not dissociate between target and distractor templates during the delay periods, suggesting similar encoding and maintenance. However, distractor preparation did lead to relatively enhanced nonlateralized posterior alpha power, which appeared to gate sensory processing at search display onset to prevent attentional capture in general. Finally, anticipating distractors also led to enhanced midfrontal theta power during the delay period, a signal that was predictive of how strongly both target and distractor were represented in the search display. Together, our results speak against a distractor-specific advance inhibitory template, thus contrary to the preactivation of specific target templates. Rather, we demonstrate a general selection suppression mechanism, which serves to prevent initial involuntary capture by anticipated distracting input.	[de Vries, Ingmar E.

J	Lee, MH; Williamson, J; Kee, YJ; Fazli, S; Lee, SW				Lee, Min-Ho; Williamson, John; Kee, Young-Jin; Fazli, Siamac; Lee, Seong-Whan			Robust detection of event-related potentials in a user-voluntary short-term imagery task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; ERP COMPONENTS; P300 DEVELOPMENT; SPELLING SYSTEM; HABITUATION	Event-related potentials (ERPs) represent neuronal activity in the brain elicited by external visual or auditory stimulation and are widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The ERP responses are elicited a few milliseconds after attending to an oddball stimulus; target and non-target stimuli are repeatedly flashed, and the ERP trials are averaged over time in order to improve their decoding accuracy. To reduce this time-consuming process, previous studies have attempted to evoke stronger ERP responses by changing certain experimental parameters like color, size, or the use of a face image as a target symbol. Since these exogenous potentials can be naturally evoked by merely looking at a target symbol, the BCI system could generate unintended commands while subjects are gazing at one of the symbols in a non-intentional mental state. We approached this problem of unintended command generation by assuming that a greater effort by the user in a short-term imagery task would evoke a discriminative ERP response. Three tasks were defined: passive attention, counting, and pitch-imagery. Users were instructed to passively attend to a target symbol, or to perform a mental tally of the number of target presentations, or to perform the novel task of imagining a high-pitch tone when the target symbol was highlighted. The decoding accuracy were 71.4%, 83.5%, and 89.2% for passive attention, counting, and pitch-imagery, respectively, after the fourth averaging procedure. We found stronger deflections in the N500 component corresponding to the levels of mental effort (passive attention: -1.094 +/- 0.88 mu V, counting: -2.226 +/- 0.97 mu V, and pitch -imagery: -2.883 +/- 0.74 mu V), which highly influenced the decoding accuracy. In addition, the rate of binary classification between passive attention and pitch-imagery tasks was 73.5%, which is an adequate classification rate that motivated us to propose a two-stage classification strategy wherein the target symbols are estimated in the first stage and the passive or active mental state is decoded in the second stage. In this study, we found that the ERP response and the decoding accuracy are highly influenced by the user's voluntary mental tasks. This could lead to a useful approach in practical ERP systems in two respects. Firstly, the user-voluntary tasks can be easily utilized in many different types of BCI systems, and performance enhancement is less dependent on the manipulation of the system's external, visual stimulus parameters. Secondly, we propose an ERP system that classifies the brain state as intended or unintended by considering the measurable differences between passively gazing and actively performing the pitch-imagery tasks in the EEG signal thus minimizing unintended commands to the BCI system.

Using medial temporal lobe (MTL) recordings from 96 neurosurgical patients, we show that time series models with volatility described by a multivariate stochastic latent-variable process and lagged interactions between signals in different brain regions provide new insights into the dynamics of brain function. The implied volatility inferred from our process positively correlates with high-frequency spectral activity, a signal that correlates with neuronal activity. We show that volatility features derived from our model can reliably decode memory states, and that this classifier performs as well as those using spectral features. Using the directional connections between brain regions during complex cognitive process provided by the model, we uncovered perirhinal-hippocampal desynchronization in the MTL regions that is associated with successful memory encoding.

This paper explores the possibility of combining a residual neural network (ResNet), brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and human participants to create "cyborgs" that improve decision making. Human participants and a ResNet undertook the same face-recognition experiment. BCIs were used to decode the decision confidence of humans from their EEG signals. Different types of cyborg groups were created, including either only humans (with or without the BCI) or groups of humans and the ResNet. Cyborg groups decisions were obtained weighing individual decisions by confidence estimates. Results show that groups of cyborgs are significantly more accurate (up to 35%) than the ResNet, the average participant, and equally-sized groups of humans not assisted by technology. These results suggest that melding humans, BCI, and machine-vision technology could significantly improve decision-making in realistic scenarios.

In the traditional PSG-based OSA detection, people's sleep may be disturbed, meanwhile the electrode slices are easily to fall off. In this paper, we study a sleep apnea detection method based on non-contact mattress, which can detect OSA accurately without disturbing sleep. Piezoelectric ceramics sensors are used to capture pressure changes in the chest and abdomen of the human body. Then heart rate and respiratory rate are extracted from impulse waveforms and respiratory waveforms that converted by filtering and processing of the pressure signals. Finally, the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is obtained by processing the obtained heartbeat signals. The features of the heartbeat interval signal and the respiratory signal are extracted over a fixed length of time, wherein a classification model is used to predict whether sleep apnea will occur during this time interval. Model fusion technology is adopted to improve the detection accuracy of sleep apnea. Results show that the proposed algorithm can be used as an effective method to detect OSA.

Here we examined whether these biomarkers may aid in the classification of unknown subjects into the target class MDD. The aforementioned biomarkers were assayed in 60 first-episode, drug-naive depressed patients and 30 controls. We used joint principal component analysis (PCA) performed on all subjects to check whether subjects cluster by classes; support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold validation; and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and SIMCA performed on calibration and validation sets and we computed the figures of merit and learnt from the data. PCA shows that both groups were well separated using the first three PCs, while correlation loadings show that all five biomarkers have discriminatory value. SVM and LDA yielded an accuracy of 100% in validation samples. Using SIMCA, there was a highly significant discrimination of both groups (model-to-model distance = 110.2); all biomarkers showed a significant discrimination and modeling power, while 100% of the patients were authenticated as MDD cases with a specificity of 93.3%. We have delineated that MDD is a distinct class with respect to neuro-immune and opioid biomarkers and that future unknown subjects can be authenticated as having MDD using this SIMCA fingerprint. Precision psychiatry should employ SIMCA to (a) authenticate patients as belonging to the claimed target class and identify other subjects as outsiders, members of another class, or aliens; and (b) acquire knowledge through learning from the data by constructing a biomarker fingerprint of the target class.

In recent years, many machine learning-based automatic MR brain image segmentation methods have been proposed as auxiliary methods of medical image analysis in clinical treatment. Nevertheless, many problems regarding precise medical images, which cannot be effectively utilized to improve partition performance, remain to be solved. Due to the poor contrast in grayscale images, the ambiguity and complexity of MR images, and individual variability, the performance of classic algorithms in medical image segmentation still needs improvement. In this paper, we introduce a distributed multitask fuzzy c-means (MT-FCM) clustering algorithm for MR brain image segmentation that can extract knowledge common among different clustering tasks. The proposed distributed MT-FCM algorithm can effectively exploit information common among different but related MR brain image segmentation tasks and can avoid the negative effects caused by noisy data that exist in some MR images. Experimental results on clinical MR brain images demonstrate that the distributed MT-FCM method demonstrates more desirable performance than the classic signal task method.

J	Chelaru, MI; Slater, JD				Chelaru, Mircea, I; Slater, Jeremy D.			A Continuous Clustering Algorithm for Detection of Local Sleep in Humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article								Objective: Research in animal models has shown that many EEG sleep features reflect local conditions, which is a consequence of relative inactivity of neuronal clusters. In humans, the authors previously reported that focal sleep patterns appear on the cortex during the wake state and suggested that this underlies the condition described as drowsiness. The focal changes at individual electrodes appeared as a combination of increased instantaneous amplitude in the delta band and decreased instantaneous frequency in the theta-alpha band during non-REM sleep, with the opposite occurring during the wake state, permitting their categorization as "active" and "inactive." A limitation of the previous work was the use of a binary k-means clustering algorithm, which created the possibility that the findings were biased toward a predominantly inactive state while the study subject was still awake. The present study tested the hypothesis that analyzing the same data by using a continuous rather than binary classifier would overcome this limitation. Methods: An analysis was performed on records from six patients with refractory epilepsy who were undergoing video-electrocorticographic monitoring with implanted subdural grid electrodes. A fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm was utilized after feature extraction from the recordings to create state classifications for each moment in each recording. A subsequent analysis was performed to determine the relative contributions of instantaneous amplitude versus instantaneous frequency to the classification. Results: Localized state changes consistent with the hypothesis were observed. The contributions from instantaneous frequency and amplitude appeared roughly equal. Conclusions: This study reveals evidence of local sleep during the wake state in humans.

J	Chen, JM; Valehi, A; Razi, A				Chen, Jiaming; Valehi, Ali; Razi, Abolfazl			Smart Heart Monitoring: Early Prediction of Heart Problems Through Predictive Analysis of ECG Signals	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Biomedical signal processing; electrocardiography; smart devices; remote monitoring; smart connected community	CLASSIFICATION; PATIENT; ARRHYTHMIAS; MORPHOLOGY; SELECTION; FAILURE; PCA	Health monitoring devices are integral parts of smart health in the era of smart connected communities. In recent years, remote heart monitoring systems are developed to harness advanced machine learning methods to identify heart disorders by processing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, current technologies suffer from two important drawbacks: i) the lack of prediction capacity to predict heart abnormalities ahead of time, and ii) failure in capturing inter-patient variability. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step predictive framework for ECG signal processing, where a global classifier recognizes severe abnormalities (red alarms) by comparing the signal against a universal reference model. The seemingly normal signal samples undergo a subsequent deviation analysis and yellow alarms are called by identifying mild and yet informative signal morphology distortions comparing to the learned patient-specific baseline that can be indicative of upcoming heart conditions. To facilitate an accurate deviation analysis, a controlled nonlinear transformation with optimized parameters is proposed to increase the symmetry of signals for different abnormality classes in the feature space. The proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 96.6% and provides a unique feature of predictive analysis by generating precaution warning messages about the elevated risk of heart abnormalities to take preventive actions according to physician orders. In particular, the chance of observing a severe problem (in terms of a red alarm) is raised by about 5% to 10% after observing a yellow alarm of the same type. The main goal of this technology is providing quality healthcare for elderly and high-risk heart-patients, however, the developed methodology is general and applicable to other biomedical signals such as EEG, Pleth, and PPG.

Changes in calbindin (CB) expression have been reported in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with controversial implications on hippocampal functions. The aim of this study was to determine the CB immunoreactivity in hippocampal dentate gyrus of patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for drug-resistant TLE with and without comorbid depression and/or memory deficits. Methods. Selected hippocampal samples from patients with TLE who underwent epilepsy surgery were included. Clinical and complementary assessment: EEG, video-EEG, MRI, psychiatric assessment (structured clinical interview, DSM-IV), and memory assessment (Rey auditory verbal learning test, RAVLT; Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, RCFT), were determined before surgery. Hippocampal sections were processed using immunoperoxidase with the anti-calbindin antibody. The semiquantitative analysis of CB immunoreactivity was determined in dentate gyrus by computerized image analysis (ImageJ). Results. Hippocampal sections of patients with TLE and HS (n=24) and postmortem controls (n=5) were included. A significant reduction of CB+ cells was found in patients with TLE (p<0.05, Student's t-test). Among TLE cases (n=24), depression (n=12) and memory deficit (n=17) were determined. Depression was associated with a higher % of cells with the CB dendritic expression (CB-sprouted cells) (F>1,20=11.81, p=0.003, hp2=0.37), a higher CB+ area (m(2)) (F>1,20=5.33, p=0.032, hp2=0.21), and a higher optical density (F>1,20=15.09, p=0.001, hp2=0.43) (two-way ANOVA). The GAF scale (general assessment of functioning) of DSM-IV inversely correlated with the % of CB-sprouted cells (r=-0.52, p=0.008) and with the CB+ area (r=-0.46, p=0.022). Conclusions. In this exploratory study, comorbid depression was associated with a differential pattern of CB cell loss in dentate gyrus combined with a higher CB sprouting. These changes may indicate granular cell dysmaturation associated to the epileptic hyperexcitability phenomena. Further investigations should be carried out to confirm these preliminary findings.

As any obtrusive measure should be avoided in preterm infants because of their immature skin development, we investigated the possibility of automated sleep staging using electrocardiograph signals from non-adhesive capacitive electrocardiography. Approach: Capacitive electrocardiography data from eight different patients with a mean gestational age of 30 +/- 2.5 weeks are compared to manually annotated reference signals from classic adhesive electrodes. The sleep annotations were performed by two trained observers based on behavioral observations. Main results: Based on these annotations, classification performance of the preterm infant active and quiet sleep states, based on capacitive electrocardiography signals, showed a kappa value of 0.56 +/- 0.20. Adding wake and caretaking into the classification, a performance of kappa 0.44 +/- 0.21 was achieved. In-between sleep state performance showed a classification performance of kappa 0.36 +/- 0.12. Lastly, a performance for all sleep states of kappa 0.35 +/- 0.17 was attained. Significance: Capacitive electrocardiography signals can be utilized to classify the central preterm infant sleep states, active and quiet sleep. With further research based on our results, automated classification of sleep states can become an essential instrument in future intensive neonatal care for continuous brain maturation monitoring. In particular, being able to use capacitive electrocardiography for continuous monitoring is a significant contributor to reducing disruption and harm for this extremely fragile patient group.

In this paper, we develop a novel event-related potential (ERP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) to detect human intention for continuously controlling dynamic systems. First, channel selection is performed by using the improved forward floating search algorithm (ISFFS). Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for feature extraction and a linear discrimination analysis or support vector machine classifier is used to decode intention for each subject. The experimental results of eight subjects show that the proposed system based on the optimal channels selected by the ISFFS algorithm and features extracted by the CNN performs well. Compared to other similar BCI systems, the proposed one can issue a command more quickly and accurately. This work not only facilitates the research of brain-controlled dynamic systems, but it also provides some new insights into the research of BCIs.

Change in stimuli proximity has been shown to have an influence on the performance of SSVEP-based BCI, where the inter-stimulus distance has a positive correlation with the overall performance. This limits the flexibility in stimulus design by imposing a constraint on the acceptable inter-stimulus distance, consequently limiting the range of applicability for SSVEP-based BCIs in real-world applications. Another limitation that needs to be addressed is the required number of EEG channels. In this study, we investigated these two challenges. A process of selecting optimal user-specific channel set was proposed. We demonstrated that the user-specific channel set is more robust against variable inter-stimulus distance. A significant improvement in accuracy (p=10(-3)) of 5% and a reduction in variation (p=10(-3)) of 55% was achieved on average when compared to the performance using the classic 3-channel set (O1, O2, Oz) and 6-channel set (O1, O2, Oz, PO3, PO4, POz).

Neuroprosthetics are being developed to manage this condition and thus improve the lives of patients. We aimed to test the feasibility of a semi-invasive technique that uses brain signals to drive an exoskeleton. Methods We recruited two participants at Clinatec research centre, associated with Grenoble University Hospital, Grenoble, France, into our ongoing clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were age 18-45 years, stability of neurological deficits, a need for additional mobility expressed by the patient, ambulatory or hospitalised monitoring, registration in the French social security system, and signed informed consent. The exclusion criteria were previous brain surgery, anticoagulant treatments, neuropsychological sequelae, depression, substance dependence or misuse, and contraindications to magnetoencephalography (MEG), EEG, or MRI. One participant was excluded because of a technical problem with the implants. The remaining participant was a 28-year-old man, who had tetraplegia following a C4-C5 spinal cord injury. Two bilateral wireless epidural recorders, each with 64 electrodes, were implanted over the upper limb sensorimotor areas of the brain. Epidural electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals were processed online by an adaptive decoding algorithm to send commands to effectors (virtual avatar or exoskeleton). Throughout the 24 months of the study, the patient did various mental tasks to progressively increase the number of degrees of freedom. Findings Between June 12,2017, and July 21,2019, the patient cortically controlled a programme that simulated walking and made bimanual, multi-joint, upper-limb movements with eight degrees of freedom during various reach-andtouch tasks and wrist rotations, using a virtual avatar at home (64.0% [SD 5.1] success) or an exoskeleton in the laboratory (70.9% [11.6] success). Compared with rnicroelectrodes, epidural ECoG is semi-invasive and has similar efficiency. The decoding models were reusable for up to approximately 7 weeks without recalibration. Interpretation These results showed long-term (24-month) activation of a four-limb neuroprosthetic exoskeleton by a complete brain-machine interface system using continuous, online epidural ECoG to decode brain activity in a tetraplegic patient. Up to eight degrees of freedom could be simultaneously controlled using a unique model, which was reusable without recalibration for up to about 7 weeks. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed and implemented a biofeedback system based on oculometrics using continuous recordings of eye movements and pupil dilations to moderate fatigue development in its early stages. Twenty healthy young participants (10 males and 10 females) performed a cyclic computer task for 31-35 min over two sessions: 1) self-triggered micro-breaks (manual sessions), and 2) biofeedback-triggered micro-breaks (automatic sessions). The sessions were held with one-week inter-session interval and in a counterbalanced order across participants. Each session involved 180 cycles of the computer task and after each 20 cycles (a segment), the task paused for 5-s to acquire perceived fatigue using Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Following the pause, a 25-s microbreak involving seated exercises was carried out whether it was triggered by the biofeed-back system following the detection of fatigue (KSS >= 5) in the automatic sessions or by the participants in the manual sessions. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) was administered after sessions. The functioning core of the biofeed-back system was based on a Decision Tree Ensemble model for fatigue classification, which was developed using an oculometrics dataset previously collected during the same computer task. The biofeedback system identified fatigue with a mean accuracy of approx. 70%. Perceived workload obtained from NASA-TLX was significantly lower in the automatic sessions compared with the manual sessions, p = 0.01 Cohen's d(z) = 0.89. The results give support to the effectiveness of integrating oculometrics-based biofeedback in timing plan of micro-breaks to impede fatigue development during computer work.

To understand this phenomenon in Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) based BCIs, data from a large-scale screening study conducted on 80 novice participants with the Berlin BCI system and its standard machine-learning approach were investigated. Each participant performed one BCI session with resting state Encephalography, Motor Observation, Motor Execution and Motor Imagery recordings and 128 electrodes. A significant portion of the participants (40%) could not achieve BCI control (feedback performance > 70%). Based on the performance of the calibration and feedback runs, BCI users were stratified in three groups. Analyses directed to detect and elucidate the differences in the SMR activity of these groups were performed. Statistics on reactive frequencies, task prevalence and classification results are reported. Based on their SMR activity, also a systematic list of potential reasons leading to performance drops and thus hints for possible improvements of BCI experimental design are given. The categorization of BCI users has several advantages, allowing researchers 1) to select subjects for further analyses as well as for testing new BCI paradigms or algorithms, 2) to adopt a better subject-dependent training strategy and 3) easier comparisons between different studies.

Investigation of the mirrored-word reading paradigm for BCI implementation	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK			English	Article						BCI; BLDA; EEG; FLDA; machine learning; mirrored-word reading paradigm	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EVOKED POTENTIALS; P300-BASED BCI; MENTAL FATIGUE; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; WHEELCHAIR; RHYTHMS; DESIGN; MODEL	Brain-computer interface (BCI) applications such as keyboard control and vehicular navigation present significant assistive merit for disabled individuals. However, there are limitations associated with BCI paradigms which restrict a wider adoption of BCI technology. For example, rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigms can induce seizures in photosensitive epileptic subjects. This paper evaluates the novel mirrored-word reading paradigm (MWRP) for BCI implementation using an offline experimental study. The offline study obtained an average single-trial classification accuracy of 74.10%. The results also demonstrate that the use of multiple trials for classification can increase the accuracy as is common with BCIs. The developed MWRP-based BCI also utilized a low presentation frequency which averts the possibility of paradigm induced photosensitivity. However, there are multiple avenues for future work. The MWRP can be implemented in the online format for real-time device control. For example, a vehicular application platform can be used where the word orientation represents directions for travel. The MWRP can also be investigated across a wider range of stimulus presentation parameters such as timing, color and stimulus size. Such studies can be used to suggest further improvements to the paradigm which can enhance its applicability for online device control.	[Harnarinesingh, Randy E.

Learning What Is Irrelevant or Relevant: Expectations Facilitate Distractor Inhibition and Target Facilitation through Distinct Neural Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; brain; EEG; expectation; inhibition; statistical learning	WORKING-MEMORY; SUPPRESSION; ATTENTION; LOCATION; CORTEX; PROBABILITY; MEG	It is well known that attention can facilitate performance by top-down biasing processing of task-relevant information in advance. Recent findings from behavioral studies suggest that distractor inhibition is not under similar direct control but strongly dependent on expectations derived from previous experience. Yet, how expectations about distracting information influence distractor inhibition at the neural level remains unclear. The current study addressed this outstanding question in three experiments in which search displays with repeating distractor or target locations across trials allowed human observers (male and female) to learn which location to selectively suppress or boost. Behavioral findings demonstrated that both distractor and target location learning resulted in more efficient search, as indexed by faster response times. Crucially, distractor learning benefits were observed without target location foreknowledge, unaffected by the number of possible target locations, and could not be explained by priming alone. To determine how distractor location expectations facilitated performance, we applied a spatial encoding model to EEG data to reconstruct activity in neural populations tuned to distractor or target locations. Target location learning increased neural tuning to target locations in advance, indicative of preparatory biasing. This sensitivity increased after target presentation. By contrast, distractor expectations did not change preparatory spatial tuning. Instead, distractor expectations reduced distractor-specific processing, as reflected in the disappearance of the Pd event-related potential component, a neural marker of distractor inhibition, and decreased decoding accuracy. These findings suggest that the brain may no longer process expected distractors as distractors, once it has learned they can safely be ignored.

MOBILE DEVELOPMENTS TO SUPPORT LEARNERS IN MAINSTREAM EDUCATION	EDULEARN19: 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES	EDULEARN Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 01-03, 2019	Palma, SPAIN			innovative use of technologies; primary school; secondary school; pedagogical innovation	CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE-TEST; DISABILITIES; VIGILANCE; CHILDREN	This paper will present findings from the second phase of an Erasmus+ funded project which addresses at its very core inclusive education, thus affecting and supporting every teacher in the European countries that ratified the UNCRPD, 2008, as well as beyond Europe. Inclusive education is a major concern globally. The project supports teachers and teacher educators who have learners with mainstream or special educational needs in mainstream classrooms, facilitating inclusive education. The countries involved in the project are Belgium, Bulgaria, Serbia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. To date the project has analyzed 74 case studies and 90 interviews with teacher educators across the countries involved to develop a pedagogical framework. This has informed the development of a mobile technology that will measure the engagement levels of learners and provide useful information to the teachers for appropriate pedagogical adaptations to planned learning content. This will promote differentiation, improve teacher understanding of different learning material impact and improve teacher and learner experience, thus leading to enhanced progression and a change in school's practice. The mobile technology, now in beta testing stage, collects and analyses the multimodal data of engagement via five specially developed computer games to test a learner's engagement level inside their comfort zone. The project draws on Swanson's standardization of signal detection theory in a continuous performance test [1][2]. The learner's performance in the game (errors and reaction time) provides objective criteria for labelling multimodal sensory data (body posture, eye gaze, facial expressions, head posture and EEG data). Machine learning methods are utilized to create a model of attention from the fused multimodal sensory data features. The learner's attention and performance levels are presented to the teacher as a method to choose best practices and teaching methods that sustain learner engagement - which encourages deep learning [3] and meaningful outcomes [4]. This paper will present findings from data collected from the beta testing phase, explain the process that has been developed, share the mobile games and associated application, and provide examples of use in schools across the partner countries. There will be opportunity for delegates to use the toolkit.

Existing wireless systems often require intracranial wires to connect implanted electrodes to an external head stage or/and deploy an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which is battery-powered or externally power-transferred, raising safety concerns such as infection, electronics failure, or heat-induced tissue damage. This work presents a biocompatible, flexible, implantable neural recorder capable of wireless acquisition of neuropotentials without wires, batteries, energy harvesting units, or active electronics. The recorder, fabricated on a thin polyimide substrate, features a small footprint of 9 mm x 8 mm x 0.3 mm and is composed of passive electronic components. The absence of active electronics on the device leads to near zero power consumption, inherently avoiding the catastrophic failure of active electronics. We performed both in vitro validation in a tissue-simulating phantom and in vivo validation in an epileptic rat. The fully passive wireless recorder was implanted under rat scalp to measure neuropotentials from its contact electrodes. The implanted wireless recorder demonstrated its capability to capture low voltage neuropotentials, including somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Wirelessly recorded SSEP and IED signals were directly compared to those from wired electrodes to demonstrate the efficacy of the wireless data. In addition, a convoluted neural network-based machine learning algorithm successfully achieved IED signal recognition accuracy as high as 100 and 91% in wired and wireless IED data, respectively. These results strongly support the fully passive wireless neural recorder's capability to measure neuropotentials as low as tens of microvolts. With further improvement, the recorder system presented in this work may find wide applications in future brain machine interface systems.

J	Bocincova, A; Johnson, JS				Bocincova, Andrea; Johnson, Jeffrey S.			The time course of encoding and maintenance of task-relevant versus irrelevant object features in working memory	CORTEX			English	Article						Working memory; Feature binding; Top-down control; Support-vector machine classifier	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATIONS; STORAGE; FOCUS; INFORMATION; TOPOGRAPHY	Access to WM can be restricted on the basis of goal-relevant properties such as spatial location. However, the extent of voluntary control over which features of an attended multi-feature object are encoded and maintained in WM is debated. Some evidence suggests that attending to an object leads to obligatory storage of all of its features, whereas other evidence suggests that access to WM can be restricted to only goal-relevant features. Another possibility is that all features are initially encoded, but irrelevant features are removed from WM over time. To address these various possibilities, we used pattern classification of EEG signals to track the temporal evolution of representations reflecting the encoding and storage of task-relevant and irrelevant features in WM. In different blocks, participants remembered the orientation, color or both orientation and color of a colored, oriented grating. The color and orientation of the grating was randomly drawn from two distinct feature bins on each trial. To examine trial-specific activity reflecting storage of the object's features, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to classify what bin the stimulus features came from. Importantly, for orientation, the classifier produced reliably above-chance classification across the delay when orientation was task-relevant but not when it was task-irrelevant. Interestingly, orientation could be accurately classified on trials for which both orientation and color were remembered. Moreover, a separate measure corresponding to the probability of a feature belonging to the correct bin was significantly higher when orientation was task-relevant compared to task-irrelevant during encoding. Above-chance classification for color was only present during the initial 500 msec across all conditions. Our results suggest that although information about all of an object's features is present in the initial stimulus-evoked neural response, information about the task-irrelevant features is attenuated during stimulus encoding and is largely absent throughout the delay.

Pre-training is common to carry out before each experiment, which affects the practicability of the EEC system. In order to solve this problem, the most feasible method is to design a unified framework for deep learning optimization, which could capture the spatial and spectral dependence of original motor imagery EEC signals according to the features extracted by CNN and the temporal dependence extracted by RNN-LSTM. The framework is superimposed from both end-to-end and time-frequency domains so as to retain and learn interpretable motor imagery features. In addition, artificial EEC signals can be automatically generated by training the generated adversarial network, which can generate the feature distribution similar to the original EEC signals, increase the capacity of EEC samples, and ultimately improve the classification performance and robustness of EEC motor imagery recognition. This deep learning framework can improve the classification accuracy of motor imagery for different subjects. In addition, the network can learn from the original data with the least amount of preprocessing, thus eliminating the time-consuming data preparation process.

To address the neurofeedback inefficacy problem, the present study is aimed to design and implement a new neurofeedback system that can more effectively and consistently regulate users' brain activities than the conventional way of training users to voluntarily regulate brain activities. The new neurofeedback system delivers external visual stimuli continuously at a specific alpha phase, which is real-time decoded from ongoing alpha wave, to regulate the alpha wave. Experimental results show that the proposed training-free externally-regulated neurofeedback (ER-NF) system can achieve consistent (effective in almost all sessions for almost all users), flexible (either increasing or decreasing peak alpha frequency and alpha power), and immediate (taking or losing effect immediately after stimulation is on or off) modulation effects on alpha wave. Therefore, the ER-NF system holds great potential to be able to more reliably and flexibly modulate cognition and behavior.

Hence, extensive studies have been conducted to establish the physiological data-based vigilance model for objectively monitoring or detecting vigilance decrement. Nevertheless, most of them using intrusive devices to collect physiological data and failed to consider context information. Consequently, these models can be used in a laboratory environment while cannot adapt to dynamic working conditions of traffic controllers. The goal of this research is to develop an adaptive vigilance model for monitoring vigilance objectively and non-intrusively. In recent years, with advanced information and communication technology, a massive amount of data can be collected from connected daily use items. Hence, we proposed a hybrid data-driven approach based on connected objects for establishing vigilance model in the traffic control center and provide an elaborated case study to illustrate the method. Specifically, eye movements are selected as the primary inputs of the proposed vigilance model; Bagged trees technique is adapted to generate the vigilance model. The results of case study indicated that (1) eye metrics would be correlated with the vigilance performance subjected to the mental fatigue levels, (2) the bagged trees with the fusion features as inputs achieved a relatively stable performance under the condition of data loss, (3) the proposed method could achieve better performance than the other classic machine learning methods.

Therefore, automated systems for epilepsy detection are required to help neurologists in diagnosing epilepsy. These automated systems act as supporting systems for the neurologists to diagnose epilepsy with good accuracy in less time. In this paper an attempt is made to develop an automated seizure detection method using deep neural network using the dataset collected from Bonn University, Germany. The results of the experiment are compared with the existing machine learning method. Our model gives better results compared to ML methods without the need of feature extraction. It is important to perform normalization of the dataset using feature scaling techniques to obtain good accuracy in the results. In this experiment we also worked on feature scaling of the dataset. At first we tried using StandardScaler and calculated loss using mean squared error. For this we achieved an accuracy of 97.21%, Sensitivity 98.17%, Specificity 94.93%, F1_score 98.48%, MCC 91.96% and ROC 97.55%. Experiment was continued to compare the performance of four different feature scaling techniques and four different loss functions. From the experimental results it was observed that StandardScaler and RobustScaler are equally good and are the best feature scaling techniques. Loss computed using Mean squared error works better in combination with all feature scaling techniques. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Thara, D.

Anti-epileptogenic and Anti-convulsive Effects of Fingolimod in Experimental Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Disease-modifying therapy; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Epileptogenesis; Experimental epilepsy models; Video-EEG	HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; INFLAMMATION; CLASSIFICATION; FREQUENCY; EFFICACY; TARGETS; SAFETY; MODEL	Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) represents a devastating neurological condition, in which approximately 4/5 of patients remain refractory for anti-convulsive drugs. Epilepsy surgery biopsies often reveal the damage pattern of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) characterized not only by neuronal loss but also pronounced astrogliosis and inflammatory changes. Since TLE shares distinct pathogenetic aspects with multiple sclerosis (MS), we have here scrutinized therapeutic effects in experimental TLE of the immunmodulator fingolimod, which is established in MS therapy. Fingolimod targets sphingosine-phosphate receptors (S1PRs). mRNAs of fingolimod target S1PRs were augmented in two experimental post status epilepticus (SE) TLE mouse models (suprahippocampal kainate/pilocarpine). SE frequently induces chronic recurrent seizures after an extended latency referred to as epileptogenesis. Transient fingolimod treatment of mice during epileptogenesis after suprahippocampal kainate-induced SE revealed substantial reduction of chronic seizure activity despite lacking acute attenuation of SE itself. Intriguingly, fingolimod exerted robust anti-convulsive activity in kainate-induced SE mice treated in the chronic TLE stage and had neuroprotective and anti-gliotic effects and reduced cytotoxic T cell infiltrates. Finally, the expression profile of fingolimod target-S1PRs in human hippocampal biopsy tissue of pharmacoresistant TLE patients undergoing epilepsy surgery for seizure relief suggests repurposing of fingolimod as novel therapeutic perspective in focal epilepsies.

In the case of medical and healthcare, extensive research has focused on the development of brain-computer interface systems, particularly those utilizing steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEPs). However, the conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis is associated with the low-frequency resolution because of the length of the analysis window, resulting in sidelobe artifacts. In this paper, we utilized the non-harmonic analysis (NHA), which does not depend on the length of the analysis window, to analyze the continuous changes in and determine the classification accuracy of SSVEPs. Moreover, our experiments utilized the gray-scale images, allowing for the presentation of the stimulus as a sinusoidal pattern and reducing the effect of frequency distortion associated with the refresh rate of the liquid-crystal display. Our findings indicated that NHA resulted in exponential improvements in time-frequency resolution when compared with the STFT analysis. As the accuracy of NHA was high, our results suggest that this method is effective for examining SSVEPs and changes in brain waves during experiments conducted using liquid-crystal displays.

It is therefore important to analyze the security and privacy threats these devices may introduce to their users. In this paper, we explore how malicious access to brainwave signals may surreptitiously reveal users' privacy-sensitive medical conditions and personal information, while they are browsing the web (or interacting with an app). At a conceptual level, we investigate the potential of brainwave signals, captured during a user's normal interactions with visual stimuli (e.g., images and audio-visuals) through a website or computer, in exposing whether the user is suffering from a given medical disorder (e.g., drug abuse or autism) and to which demographics group the user belongs (e.g., young vs. elderly or male vs. female). At an empirical level, as two representative case studies into such conceptual attacks, we present a concrete brainwave privacy attack, (Brain) Hemorrhage(1), focusing on the leakage of Alcohol Usage Disorder (AUD) and users' age group. Hemorrhage is designed using machine learning techniques to identify the users suffering from AUD and age group by analyzing the seemingly innocuous brainwave signals leaked online in response to users' viewing of simple images or watching of videos. Based on the publicly available EEG datasets on AUD and aging, our study shows that Hemorrhage can predict the presence or absence of alcohol usage disorder with the precision of 96% and the presence or absence of aging condition with 94% accuracy. We also analyze, visualize and interpret the differences in the brainwave signals corresponding to AUD and aging, which serves to justify why our attack succeeds. While the use of neuroimaging devices to diagnose medical disorders in clinical settings is a common practice in the medical field, our study constitutes one of the first steps towards exploring the malicious use of brainwave devices in compromising people's health information privacy in an online setting (otherwise protected under the HIPAA law) as well as their age privacy. Given any website can have unfettered, permission-less access to the signals captured by the current BCI devices, we believe that our work raises a serious online health privacy and age privacy issues as these devices get widely deployed.

However, the effects of short-term fasting upon brain functioning are still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect of skipping breakfast on cognitive processing by studying the electrical brain activity of young healthy indiviouals while performing several working memory tasks. Accordingly, the behavioral results and evert-related brain potentials (ERPs) of 20 healthy university students (10 males) were obtained and compared through analysis of variances (ANOVAs), during the performance of three n-back working memory (AVM) tasks in two morning sessions on both normal (after breakfast) and 12-hour fasting conditions. Significantly fewer correct responses were achieved during fasting, mainly affecting the higher WM load task. In addition, there were prolonged reaction times with increased task difficulty, regardless of breakfast intake. ERP showed a significant voltage decrement for N200 and P300 during fasting, while the amplitude of P200 notably increased. The results suggest skipping breakfast oisturbs earlier cognitive processing steps, particularly attention allocation, early decoding in working memory, and stimulus evaluation, and this effect increases with task difficulty.

Autistic and alexithymic traits modulate distinct aspects of face perception	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Autism; Alexithymia; EEG; Face perception; N170	FACIAL AFFECT RECOGNITION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; EMOTION RECOGNITION; BRAIN RESPONSES; GENERAL-POPULATION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; EXPRESSIONS; VALIDITY; N170	Background: Atypical face processing is a prominent feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but is not universal and is subject to individual variability. This heterogeneity could be accounted for by reliable yet unidentified subgroups within the diverse population of individuals with ASD. Alexithymia, which is characterized by difficulties in emotion recognition and identification, serves as a potential grouping factor. Recent research demonstrates that emotion recognition impairments in ASD are predicted by its comorbidity with alexithymia. The current study assessed the relative influence of autistic versus alexithymic traits on neural indices of face and emotion perception. Methods: Capitalizing upon the temporal sensitivity of event-related potentials (ERPs), it investigates the distinct contributions of alexithymic versus autistic traits at specific stages of emotional face processing in 27 typically developing adults (18 female). ERP components reflecting sequential stages of perceptual processing (P100, N170 and N250) were recorded in response to fear and neutral faces. Results: The results indicated that autistic traits were associated with structural encoding of faces (N170), whereas alexithymic traits were associated with more complex emotion decoding (N250). Conclusions: These findings have important implications for deconstructing heterogeneity within ASD.

J	Duman, AN; Tatar, AE; Pirim, H				Duman, Ali Nabi; Tatar, Ahmet Emin; Pirim, Harun			Uncovering Dynamic Brain Reconfiguration in MEG Working Memory n-Back Task Using Topological Data Analysis	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						working memory; topological data analysis; dynamic functional connectivity; mapper; MEG	CONNECTIVITY; NETWORKS; PATTERNS	The increasing availability of high temporal resolution neuroimaging data has increased the efforts to understand the dynamics of neural functions. Until recently, there are few studies on generative models supporting classification and prediction of neural systems compared to the description of the architecture. However, the requirement of collapsing data spatially and temporally in the state-of-the art methods to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data cause loss of important information. In this study, we addressed this issue using a topological data analysis (TDA) method, called Mapper, which visualizes evolving patterns of brain activity as a mathematical graph. Accordingly, we analyzed preprocessed MEG data of 83 subjects from Human Connectome Project (HCP) collected during working memory n-back task. We examined variation in the dynamics of the brain states with the Mapper graphs, and to determine how this variation relates to measures such as response time and performance. The application of the Mapper method to MEG data detected a novel neuroimaging marker that explained the performance of the participants along with the ground truth of response time. In addition, TDA enabled us to distinguish two task-positive brain activations during 0-back and 2-back tasks, which is hard to detect with the other pipelines that require collapsing the data in the spatial and temporal domain. Further, the Mapper graphs of the individuals also revealed one large group in the middle of the stimulus detecting the high engagement in the brain with fine temporal resolution, which could contribute to increase spatiotemporal resolution by merging different imaging modalities. Hence, our work provides another evidence to the effectiveness of the TDA methods for extracting subtle dynamic properties of high temporal resolution MEG data without the temporal and spatial collapse.

Current means to help with mental health include counseling, drug medications, and relaxation techniques such as meditation or breathing exercises to improve mental status. The theory of human touch that causes the body to release hormone oxytocin to effectively alleviate anxiety shed light on a potential alternative to assist existing methods. Wearable robots that generate affective touch have the potential to improve social bonds and regulate emotion and cognitive functions. In this study, we used a wearable robotic tactile stimulation device, AffectNodes2, to mimic human affective touch. The touch-stimulated brain waves were captured from 4 EEG electrodes placed on the parietal, prefrontal and left and right temporal lobe regions of the brain. The novel Deep MSCNN with emotion polling structure had been developed to extract Affective touch, Non-affective touch and Relaxation stimuli with over 95% accuracy, which allows the robot to grasp the current human affective status. This sensing and decoding structure is our first step towards developing a self-adaptive robot to adjust its touch stimulation patterns to help regulate affective status.

Identification of different patient subgroups with distinct audiological, psychophysical, and neurophysiological characteristics will facilitate the management of patients with tinnitus as well as the design and execution of drug development and clinical trials, which, for the most part, have not yielded conclusive results. An alternative outcome of a precision medicine approach in tinnitus would be that additional mechanistic phenotyping might not lead to the identification of distinct drivers in each individual, but instead, it might reveal that each individual may display a quantitative blend of causal factors. Therefore, a precision medicine approach towards identifying these causal factors might not lead to subtyping these patients but may instead highlight causal pathways that can be manipulated for therapeutic gain. These two outcomes are not mutually exclusive, and no matter what the final outcome is, a mechanistic-driven precision medicine approach is a win-win approach for advancing tinnitus research and treatment. Although there are several controversies and inconsistencies in the tinnitus field, which will not be discussed here, we will give a few examples, as to how the field can move forward by exploring the major neurophysiological tinnitus models, mostly by taking advantage of the common features supported by all of the models. Our position stems from the central concept that, as a field, we can and must do more to bring studies of mechanisms into the realm of neuroscience.

Error-related potential has been adopted as a signature for natural communication and performance monitoring, among others. In this work, we investigate the use of error-related potential as an input channel to transfer human preference of a strategical advisory to a computer. Air traffic control task was used as a case study to make an empirical inquiry of error-related potential for higher level cognitive tasks (i.e. situation awareness in air traffic control tasks). The experimental task requires the subjects to monitor and assess air traffic scenarios presented on a simulated environment that provides conflict resolution advisories. The task is known to be highly mental demanding as it requires continuous situation awareness of the traffic. An interface and experimental protocol were developed for this experiment to validate that error-related potential can be used a new channel for preference. The implementation of the complete design was described together with the experimental evidence of error-related potential. According to the results, we found error-related potential that is in line with existing literature. We also discussed how the preliminary findings of this work can be used as an integral part of an intelligent conflict resolution advisory system that can learn from human preference and duplicate the decision making.

Recent work has shown that prognostic implications of some key electroencephalogram features change over time. We explore whether time dependence exists for an expanded selection of quantitative electroencephalogram features and whether accounting for this time dependence enables better prognostic predictions. Design: Retrospective. Setting: ICUs at four academic medical centers in the United States. Patients: Comatose patients with acute hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We analyzed 12,397 hours of electroencephalogram from 438 subjects. From the electroencephalogram, we extracted 52 features that quantify signal complexity, category, and connectivity. We modeled associations between dichotomized neurologic outcome (good vs poor) and quantitative electroencephalogram features in 12-hour intervals using sequential logistic regression with Elastic Net regularization. We compared a predictive model using time-varying features to a model using time-invariant features and to models based on two prior published approaches. Models were evaluated for their ability to predict binary outcomes using area under the receiver operator curve, model calibration (how closely the predicted probability of good outcomes matches the observed proportion of good outcomes), and sensitivity at several common specificity thresholds of interest. A model using time-dependent features outperformed (area under the receiver operator curve, 0.83 +/- 0.08) one trained with time-invariant features (0.79 +/- 0.07; p < 0.05) and a random forest approach (0.74 +/- 0.13; p < 0.05). The time-sensitive model was also the best-calibrated. Conclusions: The statistical association between quantitative electroencephalogram features and neurologic outcome changed over time, and accounting for these changes improved prognostication performance.

Fusing Near-Infrared Spectroscopy With Wearable Hemodynamic Measurements Improves Classification of Mental Stress	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Sensor fusion; mental stress classification; near-infrared spectroscopy; wearable sensing	HEART-RATE; EEG; METAANALYSIS; FREQUENCY; BCI	Human-computer interaction technology, and the automatic classification of a person's mental state, are of interest to multiple industries. In this paper, the fusion of sensing modalities that monitor the oxygenation of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cardiovascular physiology was evaluated to differentiate between rest, mental arithmetic, and N-back memory tasks. A flexible headband to measure near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for quantifying PFC oxygenation, and forehead photo-plethysmography for assessing peripheral cardiovascular activity was designed. Physiological signals such as the electrocardiogram and seismocardiogram were collected, along with the measurements obtained using the headband. The setup was tested and validated with a total of 16 human subjects performing a series of arithmetic and N-back memory tasks. Features extracted were related to cardiac and peripheral sympathetic activity, vasomotor tone, pulse wave propagation, and oxygenation. Machine learning techniques were utilized to classify rest, arithmetic, and N-back tasks, using leave-one-subject-out cross validation. Macro-averaged accuracy of 85%, precision of 84%, recall rate of 83%, and F1 score of 80% were obtained from the classification of the three states. Statistical analyses on the subject-based results demonstrate that the fusion of NIRS and peripheral cardiovascular sensing significantly improves the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, compared to using NIRS sensing alone. Moreover, the fusion significantly improves the precision compared to peripheral cardiovascular sensing alone. The results of this paper can be used in the future to design a multi-modal wearable sensing system for classifying mental state for applications such as acute stress detection.

Mayer's cognitive model was examined, wherein the topic integration process of a user evoked by a visual stimulus can be associated with long-latency ERP components. We determined that long-latency ERP components are suitable for measuring a user's neuronal response through a literature review. We hypothesized that N300 is specific to the categorization of all shots regardless of topic relevance, N400 is specific for the semantic mismatching process for topic-irrelevant shots, and P600 is specific for the context updating process for topic-relevant shots. In our experiment, the N400 component led to more negative ERP signals in response to topic-irrelevant shots than to topic-relevant shots and showed a fronto-central scalp pattern. P600 elicited more positive ERP signals for topic-relevant shots than for topic-irrelevant shots and showed a fronto-central scalp pattern. We used discriminant and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses to decode video shot relevance and observed that the ANN produced particularly high success rates: 91.3% from the training set and 100% from the test set.

Facial expressions and social touch, for example, influence affinity and conformity. To understand the interaction between nonverbal and verbal information, we studied how the psychophysiological time-course of semiotics-the decoding of the meaning of a message-is altered by interpersonal touch and facial expressions. A virtual-reality-based economic decision-making game, ultimatum, was used to investigate how participants perceived, and responded to, financial offers of variable levels of fairness. In line with previous studies, unfair offers evoked medial frontal negativity (MFN) within the N2 time window, which has been interpreted as reflecting an emotional reaction to violated social norms. Contrary to this emotional interpretation of the MFN, however, nonverbal signals did not modulate the MFN component, only affecting fairness perception during the P3 component. This suggests that the nonverbal context affects the late, but not the early, stage of fairness perception. We discuss the implications of the semiotics of the message and the messenger as a process by which parallel information sources of "who says what" are integrated in reverse order: of the message, then the messenger.

Neural correlates of unstructured motor behaviors	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-machine interfaces; neural decoding; naturalistic behavior; ECoG; sEEG	CORTEX; POTENTIALS; INTEGRATION; ACTIVATION; INTERFACE; REGIONS; SYSTEM; ECOG; EEG; ARM	Objective. We studied the relationship between uninstructed, unstructured movements and neural activity in three epilepsy patients with intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings. Approach. We used a custom system to continuously record high definition video precisely time-aligned to clinical iEEG data. From these video recordings, movement periods were annotated via semi-automatic tracking based on dense optical flow. Main results. We found that neural signal features (8-32 Hz and 76-100 Hz power) previously identified from task-based experiments are also modulated before and during a variety of movement behaviors. These movement behaviors are coarsely labeled by time period and movement side (e.g. 'Idle' and 'Move', 'Right' and 'Left'); movements within a label can include a wide variety of uninstructed behaviors. A rigorous nested cross-validation framework was used to classify both movement onset and lateralization with statistical significance for all subjects. Significance. We demonstrate an evaluation framework to study neural activity related to natural movements not evoked by a task, annotated over hours of video. This work further establishes the feasibility to study neural correlates of unstructured behavior through continuous recording in the epilepsy monitoring unit. The insights gained from such studies may advance our understanding of how the brain naturally controls movement, which may inform the development of more robust and generalizable brain-computer interfaces.

Small Sample Motor Imagery Classification Using Regularized Riemannian Features	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); motor imagery; Riemannian geometry; dimensionality reduction; electroencephalography; signal processing	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN	Motor imagery-based electroencephalogram brain-computer interface (BCI) performance suffers from huge variations within and across subjects. This is due to different spatial and temporal characteristics among the subjects. To address these variabilities, a large number of labeled subject specific training trials are collected to calibrate systems for new subjects. This results in long calibration time that limits the BCI usage in practice. One major challenge in the development of brain computer interface is to reduce calibration time or completely eliminate it. The existing approaches rise up to this challenge by incorporating inter-subject and intra-subject variations through covariance matrices from other subject's training trials. Current approaches use covariance matrices but do not consider the geometry of the covariance matrices, which lies in the space of symmetric positive definite matrices. This inevitably limits their performance. We focus on reducing calibration time by introducing a Riemannian approach. However, in Riemannian approach the performance degrades in small sample scenario as the dimensionality of covariance matrices is large in comparison to the number of trials. To overcome this limitation, we proposed a new framework that transforms covariance matrices into a lower dimension through spatial filter regularized by data from other subjects. The efficacy of the proposed approach was validated on the small sample scenario dataset IVa from BCI competition III. The proposed approach has achieved 87.21% mean accuracy and 0.74 mean kappa on dataset IVa. The proposed method outperforms the conventional method and other existing studies on dataset IVa. To ensure the robustness of the proposed method we evaluated on dataset Ma from BCI competition III and dataset Ha from BCI competition IV. The proposed method has achieved mean accuracy 90.93% and 80.98% on dataset Ma and dataset Ha, respectively.

Feedback, one of the main elements of a closed-loop BCI, is used to enhance the user's performance. The present work aimed to compare the effect of two different feedback sources; congruent anatomical visual hand representation and passive hand movement on BCI performance and cortical activations. Electroencephalography of 12 healthy right-handed subjects was recorded to set a BCI activated by right-hand motor imagery. Afterward, the subjects were asked to control the system by imagining the movement. The system provided either visual feedback, shown on a computer screen or kinesthetic feedback, provided by a robotic hand orthosis. Differences in performance and cortical activations were assessed, using classification accuracy and event-related desynchronization/synchronization in mu and beta bands, respectively. Performance was significantly better with kinesthetic feedback as it allowed for higher correct classification of motor imagery. Cortical activations in the ipsilateral central channel in mu were different between the two feedback modalities. Our results imply that healthy subjects can achieve a greater degree of control using a motor imagery-based BCI with kinesthetic feedback than with anatomically congruent visual feedback. Furthermore, cortical activation differences show that kinesthetic feedback seems to elicit higher recruitment of sensorimotor cortex brain cells, which probably reflects enhanced local information modulation related to fine motor processing. Therefore, kinesthetic feedback provided by a robotic orthosis could be a more suitable feedback strategy for BCI systems designed for neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation.

J	Yang, T; Kim, SP				Yang, Taeyang; Kim, Sung-Phil			Group-Level Neural Responses to Service-to-Service Brand Extension	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brand extension; event-related potential; P300; neuromarketing; EEG decoding	CATEGORIZATION; PRODUCT; CORTEX	Brand extension is a marketing strategy leveraging well-established brand to promote new offerings provided as goods or service. The previous neurophysiological studies on goods-to-goods brand extension have proposed that categorization and semantic memory processes are involved in brand extension evaluation. However, it is unknown whether these same processes also underlie service-to-service brand extension. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate neural processes in consumers underlying their judgment of service-to-service brand extension. Specifically, we investigated human electroencephalographic responses to extended services that were commonly considered to fit well or badly with parent brand among consumers. For this purpose, we proposed a new stimulus grouping method to find commonly acceptable or unacceptable service extensions. In the experiment, participants reported the acceptability of 56 brand extension pairs, consisting of parent brand name (S1) and extended service name (S2). From individual acceptability responses, we assigned each pair to one of the three fit levels: high- (i.e., highly acceptable), low-, and mid-fit. Next, we selected stimuli that received high/low-fit evaluations from a majority of participants (i.e., >85%) and assigned them to a high/low population-fit group. A comparison of event-related potentials (ERPs) between population-fit groups through a paired t-test showed significant differences in the fronto-central N2 and fronto-parietal P300 amplitudes. We further evaluated inter-subject variability of these ERP components by a decoding analysis that classified N2 and/or P300 amplitudes into a high, or low population-fit class using a support vector machine. Leave-one-subject-out validation revealed classification accuracy of 60.35% with N2 amplitudes, 78.95% with P300, and 73.68% with both, indicating a relatively high inter-subject variability of N2 but low for P300. This validation showed that fronto-parietal P300 reflected neural processes more consistent across subjects in service-to-service brand extension. We further observed that the left frontal P300 amplitude was increased as fit-level increased across stimuli, indicating a semantic retrieval process to evaluate a semantic link between S1 and S2. Parietal P300 showed a higher amplitude in the high population-fit group, reflecting a similarity-based categorization process. In sum, our results suggest that service-to-service brand extension evaluation may share similar neural processes with goods-to-goods brand extension.

This study proposes a new BCI technique to increase the number of commands in a single BCI system without loss of accuracy. New method: We expected that a flickering action video with left and right elbow movements could simultaneously activate the different pattern of event-related desynchronization (ERD) according to the video contents (e.g., left or right) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). The classification accuracy to discriminate left, right, and rest states was compared under the three following feature combinations: SSVEP power (19-21 Hz), Mu power (8-13 Hz), and simultaneous SSVEP and Mu power. Results: The SSVEP feature could discriminate the stimulus condition, regardless of left or right, from the rest condition, while the Mu feature discriminated left or right, but was relatively poor in discriminating stimulus from rest. However, combining the SSVEP and Mu features, which were evoked by the stimulus with a single frequency, showed superior performance for discriminating all the stimuli among rest, left, or right. Comparison with the existing method: The video contents could activate the ERD differently, and the flickering component increased its accuracy, such that it revealed a better performance to discriminate when considering together. Conclusions: This paradigm showed possibility of increasing performance in terms of accuracy and number of commands with a single frequency by applying flickering action video paradigm and applicability to rehabilitation systems used by patients to facilitate their mirror neuron systems while training.

Polysomnographic recordings in eight patients in CLIS, however, revealed the presence of regular episodes of deep sleep during night time in all patients. It was also possible to distinguish an alpha-like state and a wake-like state. Classification of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is difficult because of absent eye movements and absent muscular activity. Four out of eight patients did not show any sleep spindles. Those who have spindles also show K-complexes and thus regular phases of sleep stage 2. Thus, despite some irregularities, we found a surprisingly healthy sleep pattern in these patients. Statement of Significance The presence of circadian variation in EEG activity points to a conserved sleep-wake cycle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients in completely locked-in state (CLIS). There are marked differences between these patients and healthy participants, e.g. a complete loss of sleep spindles in some patients and the presence of sinusoid, high-amplitude theta activity instead of alpha activity. Slow-wave generation, on the other hand, seems intact in all patients. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is present in at least some patients, but it cannot be ascertained in all patients. The existence of intact sleep in patients in CLIS is another important sign that their wakefulness is likewise intact. It also indicates that providing undisturbed sleep opportunity will be important for the patients' mental well-being.

Experimental data was recorded from eyes-opened volunteers during listening the musical chords by piano. Complexity estimation methods were compared to each other for classification of groups (professional musicians and non-musicians) by using both classifiers (support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB)) and statistical tests (one-way ANOVA) with respect to electrode locations. Permutation entropy (PermEn) is found to be the best metric (p << 0.0001, 98.37% and 98.41% accuracies for tonal and atonal ensembles) at fronto-temporal regions which are responsible for cognitive task evaluation and perception of sound. PermEn also provides the meaningful results at the whole cortex (p << 0.0001, 99.81% accuracy for both tonal and atonal ensembles) through SVM with Radial Basis kernels superior to Gaussians. Almost the similar performance is also obtained for temporal features. Although, performance improvements are observed for spectral methods with NB, the considerable better results are obtained with SVM. The results indicate that musical stimuli cause pattern variations instead of spectral variations on STABO due to relatively higher neuronal activities around auditory cortex. In conclusion, temporal regions produce response to auditory stimuli, while frontal area integrates the auditory task at the same time. As well, the parietal cortex produces neural information according to the degree of attention generated by environmental changes such as atonal stimuli. It can be clearly stated that musical experience enhances the neural encoding performance of sound tonality at mostly fronto-temporal regions.

Whether and how these methodological choices affect emotion-sensitive components of the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) is yet unclear. Therefore, this pre-registered study examined ERP modulations to close-up full-coloured and grey-scaled faces as well as cutout fearful and neutral facial expressions, while attention was directed to no-face oddballs. Results revealed no interaction of face naturalness and emotion for any ERP component, but showed, however, large main effects for both factors. Specifically, fearful faces and decreasing face naturalness elicited substantially enlarged N170 and early posterior negativity amplitudes and lower face naturalness also resulted in a larger P1.This pattern reversed for the LPP, showing linear increases in LPP amplitudes with increasing naturalness. We observed no interaction of emotion with face naturalness, which suggests that face naturalness and emotion are decoded in parallel at these early stages. Researchers interested in strong modulations of early components should make use of cutout grey-scaled faces, while those interested in a pronounced late positivity should use close-up coloured faces.

This is achieved in two main steps. In the first step, we take EEG response to color stimuli from the scalp using the standard 10-20 electrode system. Experiments undertaken using Exact Low Resolution Electromagnetic Topographic (eLORETA) software reveal that there exist long term (around 1 second) correlations between activated brain regions and the perceptual process of specific color stimulus. For instance, the parietal and the occipital lobe activations have long duration correlations with the blue color stimuli; whereas the prefrontal and the occipital lobe activations have correlations with the red color, while the temporal and the occipital lobe activations have correlations with the green color. In the second step, we classify the perceived color of the brain signals acquired from the selected brain regions. A one dimensional based Convolutional Neural Network (1DCNN) classifier has been designed to perform the classification process by utilizing the brain signals from the activated lobes. The present classifier model has also been compared with other primitive classifiers. Performance analysis followed by statistical tests undertaken reveals that the 1D CNN classifier outperforms its traditional counterparts by a wide margin. The proposed technique is expected to have interesting applications to explain the malfunctioning in recognition of colored stimuli due to damage in certain brain lobes like occipital, temporal etc.	[Laha, Mousumi; Ghosh, Sayantani; Bagchi, Anurag; Pramanick, Shraman; Konar, Amit] Jadavpur Univ, ETCE Dept, Artificial Intelligence Lab, Kolkata, India		Laha, M (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, ETCE Dept, Artificial Intelligence Lab, Kolkata, India.	lahamou@gmail.com; sayantani.sonrisa25@gmail.com; miccooper9@gmail.com; konaramit@yahoo.co.in			University Grant Commission (UGC)	University Grant Commission (UGC)(University Grants Commission, India)	Authors gratefully acknowledge the support they received from the University Grant Commission (UGC) funded Project: UPE Phase-II granted to Jadavpur University.		12	0	0	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-5386-9279-0				2019							425	429						5	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Telecommunications	BS9UY					2022-08-02	WOS:000784179900090

MULTISAB: A Web Platform for Analysis of Multivariate Heterogeneous Biomedical Time-Series	WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2018, VOL 1	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IUPESM World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering	JUN 03-08, 2018	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	CSBMEMI, Czech Assoc Med Physicists, Varian, RaySearch Labs, Elekta, Int Union Phys & Engn Sci Med, Czech Med Assoc J E Purkyne, Int Org Med Phys, Int Federat Med & Biol Engn		Biomedical time series; Web platform; Analysis	HRV	There is a growing need for efficient and accurate biomedical software in healthcare community. In this paper, we present MULTISAB, a web platform whose goal is to provide users with detailed analysis capabilities for heterogeneous biomedical time series. We describe the system architecture, including its subprojects: fron-tend, backend and processing. Emphasis is placed on the processing subproject, implemented in Java, which incorporates data analysis methods. The subproject is divided into several frameworks: record input handling, preprocessing, signal visualization, general time series features extraction, specific (domain) time series features extraction, expert system recommendations, data mining, and reporting. Common signal features extraction framework includes a great number of features in time (both linear and nonlinear), frequency and time-frequency domain. Currently, domain specific frameworks for heart rate variability, ECG and EEG feature extraction are supported, which also include preprocessing techniques for noise reduction and detection methods for characteristic waveforms (like QRS complexes, P and T waves in ECG). Parallelization is implemented for feature extraction to increase performance. It is realized using multi-threading on several levels: for multiple records, traces, and segments. Expert system is implemented, which provides automatic recommendation of the set of significant expert features that should be extracted from the analyzed signals, depending on the analysis scenario. The expert system, apart from the role in recommending features, can also participate in automatic diagnosis, after the features are extracted. Current expert system prototype contains diagnostic rules for acute myocardial ischemia, based on medical guidelines. Data mining framework contains dimensionality reduction methods and machine learning classifiers used to construct accurate and interpretable disorder models. A report is produced at the end of the process using openly available libraries. The platform includes best practices from medicine, biomedical engineering, and computer science in order to deliver detailed biomedical time series analysis services to its users.

J	Shen, L; Han, B; Chen, LH; Chen, Q				Shen, Lu; Han, Biao; Chen, Lihan; Chen, Qi			Perceptual inference employs intrinsic alpha frequency to resolve perceptual ambiguity	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							VISUAL-PERCEPTION; EEG ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; APPARENT MOTION; REACTION-TIME; DEFAULT-MODE; AREA MT; PHASE	The brain uses its intrinsic dynamics to actively predict observed sensory inputs, especially under perceptual ambiguity. However, it remains unclear how this inference process is neurally implemented in biasing perception of ambiguous inputs towards the predicted percepts. The process of perceptual inference can be well illustrated by the phenomenon of bistable apparent motion in the Ternus display, in which subjective perception spontaneously alternates between element motion (EM) and group motion (GM) percepts depending on whether two consecutively presented frames are grouped over time or not. The frequency of alpha-band oscillations has long been hypothesized to gate the temporal window of perceptual grouping over time. Under this hypothesis, variation in the intrinsic alpha frequency should predict perceptual outcome of the bistable Ternus display. Moreover, we hypothesize that the perception system employs this prior knowledge on intrinsic alpha frequency to resolve perceptual ambiguity, by shifting perceptual inference towards the predicted percepts. Using electroencephalography and intracranial recordings, we showed that both between and within subjects, lower prestimulus alpha frequencies (PAFs) predicted the EM percepts since the two frames fell in the same alpha cycle and got temporally integrated, while higher PAFs predicted the GM percepts since the two frames fell in different alpha cycles. Multivariate decoding analysis between the EM percepts with lower PAFs and the GM percepts with higher PAFs further revealed a representation of the subsequently reported bistable percept in the neural signals shortly before the actual appearance of the second frame. Therefore, perceptual inference, based on variation in intrinsic PAFs, biases poststimulus neural representations by inducing preactivation of the predicted percepts. In addition, enhanced prestimulus blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and network dynamics in the frontoparietal network, together with reduced prestimulus alpha power, upon perceiving the EM percepts suggest that temporal grouping is an attention-demanding process. Author summary Our subjective perception of the external world is constantly shaped not only by sensory inputs but also by the real-time internal status of our own brain. Upon facing an ambiguous sensory input, our brain employs its intrinsic dynamics to bias perception towards the predicted percept, resolving in this manner perceptual ambiguity. However, it remains poorly understood how this process is implemented in the brain. Using electroencephalogram and functional MRI in healthy participants and intracranial recordings in epileptic patients, we show that neural rhythms in the alpha frequency (8-13 Hz)one of the predominant neural oscillations in the visual systemgate the time window for perceptual grouping: two consecutively presented frames in a constant ambiguous dynamic visual scene will be temporally integrated if they fall in the same alpha cycle but spatially integrated if they fall in different alpha cycles. Moreover, our brain employs the real-time speed of its intrinsic alpha oscillations to actively predict the most possibly observed percepts by inducing preactivation of neural representations that resemble the one evoked by the actual stimuli, even before it is presented.

MCI patients have a high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and for that reason the introduction of novel and reliable biomarkers is of significant clinical importance. Motivated by recent findings on the rich information of dynamic functional connectivity graphs (DFCGs) about brain (dys) function, we introduced a novel approach of identifying MCI based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting state recordings. The activity of different brain rhythms {delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 1, gamma 2} was first beamformed with linear constrained minimum norm variance in the MEG data to determine 90 anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). A DFCG was then estimated using the imaginary part of phase lag value (iPLV) for both intra-frequency coupling (8) and cross-frequency coupling pairs (28). We analyzed DFCG profiles of neuromagnetic resting state recordings of 18 MCI patients and 22 healthy controls. We followed our model of identifying the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DICM) across MEG sources and temporal segments, which further leads to the construction of an integrated DFCG (iDFCG). We then filtered statistically and topologically every snapshot of the iDFCG with data-driven approaches. An estimation of the normalized Laplacian transformation for every temporal segment of the iDFCG and the related eigenvalues created a 2D map based on the network metric time series of the eigenvalues (NMTSeigs). The NMTSeigs preserves the non-stationarity of the fluctuated synchronizability of iDCFG for each subject. Employing the initial set of 20 healthy elders and 20 MCI patients, as training set, we built an overcomplete dictionary set of network microstates (n mu states). Afterward, we tested the whole procedure in an extra blind set of 20 subjects for external validation. We succeeded in gaining a high classification accuracy on the blind dataset (85%), which further supports the proposed Markovian modeling of the evolution of brain states. The adaptation of appropriate neuroinformatic tools that combine advanced signal processing and network neuroscience tools could properly manipulate the non-stationarity of time-resolved FC patterns revealing a robust biomarker for MCI.

Cortical activation in generalized seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						electroencephalogram; GABA(A) receptor; generalized; signal analysis	SPIKE-WAVE DISCHARGES; ABSENCE SEIZURES; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; GENERATED SEIZURES; ILAE COMMISSION; FAST COMPONENTS; POSITION PAPER; GENETIC MODEL; EPILEPSY; CLASSIFICATION	Objective Patients with generalized epilepsy exhibit different epileptiform events including asymptomatic interictal spikes (IS), absence seizures with spike-wave discharges (SWDs), and myoclonic seizures (MS). Our objective was to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical activation in SWDs, IS, and MS in the Gabra1(+/A322D) juvenile myoclonic epilepsy mouse. Methods We fabricated affordable, flexible high-density electroencephalography (HdEEG) arrays and recorded spontaneous SWD, IS, and MS with video/HdEEG. We determined differences among the events in amplitude spectral density (ASD) in the delta/theta/alpha/beta/gamma frequency bands at baseline (3.5-4.0 seconds before the first spike time, t(0)) and the prespike period (0.1-0.5 seconds before t(0)), and we elucidated the spatiotemporal activation during the t(0) spike. Results All three events had an increase in ASD between baseline and prespike in at least one frequency band. During prespike, MS had the largest delta-band ASD, but SWD had the greatest alpha/beta/gamma band ASD. For all three events, the ASD was largest in the anterior regions. The t(0) spike voltage was also greatest in the anterior regions for all three events and IS and MS had larger voltages than SWD. From 7.5 to 17.5 msec after t(0), MS had greater voltage than IS and SWD, and maximal voltage was in the posterior parietal region. Significance Changes in spectral density from baseline to prespike indicate that none of these generalized events are instantaneous or entirely unpredictable. Prominent engagement of anterior cortical regions during prespike and at t(0) suggest that common anterior neural circuits participate in each event. Differences in prespike ASD signify that although the events may engage similar brain regions, they may arise from distinct proictal states with different neuronal activity or connectivity. Prolonged activation of the posterior parietal area in MS suggests that posterior circuits contribute to the myoclonic jerk. Together, these findings identify brain regions and processes that could be specifically targeted for further recording and modulation.

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether electrographic effects of responsive neurostimulation (RNS), identified in electrocorticographic (ECOG) recordings from the device, are associated with patient outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective review of ECOG recordings and accompanying clinical meta-data from 11 consecutive patients with focal epilepsy who were implanted with a neurostimulation system between January 28, 2015, and June 6, 2017, with 22 to 112 weeks of follow-up. Recorded ECOG data were obtained from the manufacturer; additional system-generated meta-data, including recording and detection settings, were collected directly from the manufacturer's management system using an in-house, custom-built platform. Electrographic seizure patterns were identified in RNS recordings and evaluated in the time-frequency domain, which was locked to the onset of the seizure pattern. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patterns of electrophysiological modulation were identified and then classified according to their latency of onset in relation to triggered stimulation events. Seizure control after RNS implantation was assessed by 3 main variables: mean frequency of seizure occurrence, estimated mean severity of seizures, and mean duration of seizures. Overall seizure outcomes were evaluated by the extended Personal Impact of Epilepsy Scale questionnaires, a patient-reported outcome measure of 3 domains (seizure characteristics, medication adverse effects, and quality of life), with a range of possible scores from 0 to 300 in which lower scores indicate worse status, and the Engel scale, which comprises 4 classes (I-IV) in which lower numbers indicate greater improvement. RESULTS Electrocorticographic data from 11 patients (8 female; mean [range] age, 35 [19-65] years; mean [range] duration of epilepsy, 19 [5-37] years) were analyzed. Two main categories of electrophysiological signatures of stimulation-induced modulation of the seizure network were discovered: direct and indirect effects. Direct effects included ictal inhibition and early frequency modulation but were not associated with improved clinical outcomes (odds ratio [OR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.06-7.35; P>.99). Only indirect effects-those occurring remote from triggered stimulation-were associated with improved clinical outcomes (OR, infinity; 95% CI, -infinity to infinity; P=.02). These indirect effects included spontaneous ictal inhibition, frequency modulation, fragmentation, and ictal duration modulation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that RNS effectiveness may be explained by long-term, stimulation-induced modulation of seizure network activity rather than by direct effects on each detected seizure.

Epidemiology and Resource Utilization of Simple Febrile Seizure-associated Hospitalizations in the United States, 2003-2012	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Biennial Symposium on Pediatric Anesthesia Neurodevelopmental Assessment (PANDA) - Anesthesia and Neurodevelopment in Children	APR 14-15, 2018	Columbia Univ Med Ctr, New York, NY	New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Childrens Hosp New York	Columbia Univ Med Ctr	seizure; children; imaging; EEG; lumbar puncture	NEURODIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION; AAP GUIDELINES; CHILD; MANAGEMENT	Background: Simple febrile seizure (SFS) affects 2% to 4% of children under 6 years of age. The purpose of this study is to examine the epidemiologic patterns and resource utilization of SFS-associated hospitalizations in children aged younger than 6 years of age in the United States. Materials and Methods: This study is a serial, retrospective analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Databases for the years 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012. SFS-associated hospitalizations were identified based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis code 780.31. We calculated the proportion of hospitalizations in pediatric patients under 6 years of age due to SFS and all other nonbirth causes, the rate of SFS-associated hospitalizations per 100,000 population, the mean length of stay and inflation-adjusted hospital costs of SFS-associated hospitalizations, as well as patient demographics and hospital characteristics. Results: From 2003 to 2012, the weighted proportion of hospitalizations due to SFS declined from 0.83% to 0.41% (P<0.01) and the annual rate of SFS-associated hospitalizations per 100,000 population decreased from 48.0 to 18.7 (P<0.01). However, use of computed tomography, electroencephalogram, and lumbar puncture in SFS-associated hospitalizations decreased significantly (all P<0.001), but the utilization rate of magnetic resonance imaging remained stable (P=0.53). The mean length of stay for SFS-associated hospitalizations decreased from 2.03 days in 2003 to 1.74 days in 2012, and the mean hospital costs (exclusive of professional payment) decreased from $3830 in 2003 to $3223 in 2012 (both P<0.001). Conclusions: SFS-associated hospitalizations and resource utilization in children under 6 years of age have decreased markedly in the United States, probably due to improved clinical adherence to the practice parameters set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics for managing patients with SFS.

However, only a limited number of mental tasks have been previously investigated and classified. This study aimed to investigate two motor imagery (MI) commands, moving forward and moving backward, using a small number of EEG channels, to be used in a neurofeedback context. This study also aimed to simulate a BCI and investigate the offline classification between MI movements in forward and backward directions, using different features and classification methods. Ten healthy people participated in a two-session (48 min each) experiment. This experiment investigated neurofeedback of navigation in a virtual tunnel. Each session consisted of 320 trials where subjects were asked to imagine themselves moving in the tunnel in a forward or backward motion after a randomly presented (forward versus backward) command on the screen. Three electrodes were mounted bilaterally over the motor cortex. Trials were conducted with feedback. Data from session 1 were analyzed offline to train classifiers and to calculate thresholds for both tasks. These thresholds were used to form control signals that were later used online in session 2 in neurofeedback training to trigger the virtual tunnel to move in the direction requested by the users brain signals. After 96 min of training, the online band-power neurofeedback training achieved an average classification of 76%, while the offline BCI simulation using power spectral density asymmetrical ratio and AR-modeled band power as features, and using LDA and SVM as classifiers, achieved an average classification of 80%.

Here, we investigated the impact of prestimulus neural fluctuations on the content of perception-that is, whether one or another object is perceived. We recorded neural activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) before and while participants briefly viewed an ambiguous image, the Rubin face/vase illusion, and required them to report their perceived interpretation in each trial. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we showed robust decoding of the perceptual report during the poststimulus period. Applying source localization to the classifier weights suggested early recruitment of primary visual cortex (V1) and similar to 160-ms recruitment of the category-sensitive fusiform face area (FFA). These poststimulus effects were accompanied by stronger oscillatory power in the gamma frequency band for face vs. vase reports. In prestimulus intervals, we found no differences in oscillatory power between face vs. vase reports in V1 or in FFA, indicating similar levels of neural excitability. Despite this, we found stronger connectivity between V1 and FFA before face reports for low-frequency oscillations. Specifically, the strength of prestimulus feedback connectivity (i.e., Granger causality) from FFA to V1 predicted not only the category of the upcoming percept but also the strength of poststimulus neural activity associated with the percept. Our work shows that prestimulus network states can help shape future processing in category-sensitive brain regions and in this way bias the content of visual experiences.

Recent work, however, suggests that viewing changing expressions more robustly evokes physiological responses. Here, we examined the sensitivity of steady-state visual evoked potentials and intrinsic oscillatory brain activity to transient emotional changes in facial expressions. Twenty-two participants viewed sequences of grayscale faces periodically turned on and off at a rate of 17.5 Hz, to evoke flicker steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) in visual cortex. Each sequence began with a neutral face (flickering for 2290 msec), immediately followed by a face from the same actor (also flickering for 2290 msec) with one of four expressions (happy, angry, fearful, or another neutral expression), followed by the initially presented neutral face (flickering for 1140 msec). The amplitude of the ssVEP and the power of intrinsic brain oscillations were analyzed, comparing the four expression-change conditions. We found a transient perturbation (reduction) of the ssVEP that was more pronounced after the neutral-to-angry change compared to the other conditions, at right posterior sensors. Induced alpha-band (8-13 Hz) power was reduced compared to baseline after each change. This reduction showed a central-occipital topography and was strongest in the subtlest and rarest neutral-to-neutral condition. Thus, the ssVEP indexed involvement of face-sensitive cortical areas in decoding affective expressions, whereas mid-occipital alpha power reduction reflected condition frequency rather than expression-specific processing, consistent with the role of alpha power changes in selective attention.

While animal models have verified this idea extensively, there is still no clear evidence in humans. Here we test this hypothesis, evaluating the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease in a longitudinal study. We compared the functional resting state eyes-closed magnetoencephalographic networks of 54 patients with MCI who were followed-up every 6 months. According to their clinical outcome, they were split into: (i) the 'progressive' MCI (n = 27) group; and (ii) the 'stable' MCI group (n = 27). They did not differ in gender or educational level. For all participants, two magnetoencephalographic recordings were acquired. Functional connectivity was evaluated using the phase locking value. To extract the functional connectivity network with significant changes between both magnetoencephalographic recordings, we evaluated the functional connectivity ratio, defined as functional connectivity post-/pre-condition, in a network-based statistical model with an ANCOVA test with age as covariate. Two significant networks were found in the theta and beta bands, involving fronto-temporal and fronto-occipital connections, and showing a diminished functional connectivity ratio in the progressive MCI group. These topologies were then evaluated at each condition showing that at baseline, patients with progressive MCI showed higher synchronization than patients with stable MCI, while in the post-condition this pattern was reversed. These results may be influenced by two main factors in the post-condition: the increased synchrony in the stable MCI patients and the network failure in the progressive MCI patients. These findings may be explained as an 'X' form model where the hypersynchrony predicts conversion, leading subsequently to a network breakdown in progressive MCI. Patients with stable MCI showed an opposite phenomenon, which could indicate that they were a step beyond in the Alzheimer's disease continuum. This model would be able to predict the risk for the conversion to dementia in MCI patients.

Can absence seizures be predicted by vigilance states?: Advanced analysis of sleep-wake states and spike-wave discharges' occurrence in rats	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Spike-wave discharges; Sleep-wake states; WAG/Rij rats; Predictability; Conditional Shannon entropy; Absence epilepsy	CATEGORICAL-DATA; SLOW-WAVE; EPILEPSY; PATTERNS; DYNAMICS; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Spike-wave discharges (SWDs) are the main manifestation of absence epilepsy. Their occurrence is dependent on the behavioral state, and they preferentially occur during unstable vigilance periods. The present study investigated whether the occurrence of SWDs can be predicted by the preceding behavioral state and whether this relationship is different between the light and the dark phases of the 24-h day. Twenty-four-hour (12:12 light/dark phases) electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of 12 Wistar Albino Glaxo, originally bred in Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats, a well-known genetic model of absence epilepsy, were analyzed and transformed into sequences of 2-s length intervals of the following 6 possible states: active wakefulness (AW), passive wakefulness (PW), deep slow-wave sleep (DSWS). light slow-wave sleep (LSWS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and SWDs, given discrete series of categorical data. Probabilities of all transitions between states and Shannon entropy of transitions were calculated for the light and dark phases separately and statistically analyzed. Common differences between the light and the dark phases were found regarding the time spent in AW, LSWS, DSWS, and SWDs. The most probable transitions were that AW was preceded and followed by PW and vice versa regardless of the phase of the photoperiod. A similar relationship was found for light and deep slow-wave sleep. The most probable transitions to and from SWDs were AW and LSWS, respectively, with these transition likelihoods being consistent across both circadian phases. The second most probable transitions around SWDs appeared more variable between light and dark. During the light phase, SWDs occurred around PW and participated exclusively in sleep initiation: in the dark phase. SWDs were seen on both, ascending and descending steps towards and from sleep. Conditional Shannon entropy showed that AW and DSWS are the most predictable events, while the possible prediction horizon of SWDs is not larger than 4 s and despite the higher occurrence of SWDs in the dark phase, did not differ between phases. It can be concluded that although SWDs show a stable, strong circadian rhythm with a peak in number during the dark phase, their occurrence cannot be reliably predicted by the preceding behavioral state, except at a very short time base.
