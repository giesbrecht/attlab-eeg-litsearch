J	Chen, JJ; Yu, ZL; Gu, ZH; Li, YQ				Chen, Junjian; Yu, Zhuliang; Gu, Zhenghui; Li, Yuanqing			Deep Temporal-Spatial Feature Learning for Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Training; Band-pass filters; Decoding; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Brain-computer interfaces; Motor imagery (MI); electroencephalography (EEG); deep learning; convolutional neural network (CNN); triplet loss	NEURAL-NETWORKS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; EEG/MEG; FILTERS	Motor imagery (MI) decoding is an important part of brain-computer interface (BCI) research, which translates the subject's intentions into commands that external devices can execute. The traditional methods for discriminative feature extraction, such as common spatial pattern (CSP) and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP), have only focused on the energy features of the electroencephalography (EEG) and thus ignored the further exploration of temporal information. However, the temporal information of spatially filtered EEG may be critical to the performance improvement of MI decoding. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach termed filter-bank spatial filtering and temporal-spatial convolutional neural network (FBSF-TSCNN) for MI decoding, where the FBSF block transforms the raw EEG signals into an appropriate intermediate EEG presentation, and then the TSCNN block decodes the intermediate EEG signals. Moreover, a novel stage-wise training strategy is proposed to mitigate the difficult optimization problem of the TSCNN block in the case of insufficient training samples. Firstly, the feature extraction layers are trained by optimization of the triplet loss. Then, the classification layers are trained by optimization of the cross-entropy loss. Finally, the entire network (TSCNN) is fine-tuned by the back-propagation (BP) algorithm. Experimental evaluations on the BCI IV 2a and SMR-BCI datasets reveal that the proposed stage-wise training strategy yields significant performance improvement compared with the conventional end-to-end training strategy, and the proposed approach is comparable with the state-of-the-art method.

One of the main assumptions of machine learning is that training and test data belong to the same feature space and are subject to the same probability distribution. However, this may be violated in EEG processing. Variations across sessions/subjects result in a deviation of the feature distribution of EEG signals in the same task, which reduces the accuracy of the decoding model for mental tasks. Recently, transfer learning (TL) has shown great potential in processing EEG signals across sessions/subjects. In this work, we reviewed 80 related published studies from 2010 to 2020 about TL application for EEG decoding. Herein, we report what kind of TL methods have been used (e.g., instance knowledge, feature representation knowledge, and model parameter knowledge), describe which types of EEG paradigms have been analyzed, and summarize the datasets that have been used to evaluate performance. Moreover, we discuss the state-of-the-art and future development of TL for EEG decoding. The results show that TL can significantly improve the performance of decoding models across subjects/sessions and can reduce the calibration time of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. This review summarizes the current practical suggestions and performance outcomes in the hope that it will provide guidance and help for EEG research in the future.

In this method, a multilevel machine learning method is presented to diagnose epilepsy disease. The proposed multilevel EEG classification method consists of pre-processing, feature extraction, feature concatenation, feature selection and classification phases. In order to create levels, Tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is chosen and 25 frequency coefficients sub-bands are calculated by using TQWT in the pre-processing. In the feature extraction phase, quadruple symmetric pattern (QSP) is chosen as feature extractor and extracts 256 features from the raw EEG signal and the extracted 25 sub-bands. In the feature selection phase, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is used. The 128, 256, 512 and 1024 most significant features are selected in this phase. In the classification phase, k nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier is utilized as classifier. The proposed method is tested on seven cases using Bonn EEG dataset. The proposed method achieved 98.4% success rate for 5 classes case. Therefore, our proposed method can be used in bigger datasets for more validation.

The set of relevant and discriminative features plays an important role in the classification scheme. This paper presents a supervised approach to select discriminative features for the enhancement of MI classification using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) signal. The dimension of multiband feature space is reduced using the feature selection method. Each trial of the multichannel EEG signal representing MI tasks is decomposed into a finite set of narrowband signals. The common spatial pattern-based features are extracted from each subband. The features obtained from the multiple subbands are combined to derive a high-dimensional feature vector. The neighborhood component analysis-based feature selection method is implemented to select the features that are relevant in performing an accurate classification. It is a nearest-neighbor-based approach to learn the feature weights with regularization by maximizing the average leave-one-out classification accuracy over the labeled training data. The selected features are used to train the support vector machine for classification. The features relatively irrelevant to the classification task are discarded, yielding a reduction of feature dimension. The evaluation of the proposed method is performed using BCI Competition III dataset 4a and IV dataset 2b. Both are publicly available datasets and are used as types of benchmark data to evaluate the MI classification algorithm to implement BCI. The obtained simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed method compared to the recently developed algorithms.

J	Borra, D; Fantozzi, S; Magosso, E				Borra, Davide; Fantozzi, Silvia; Magosso, Elisa			Interpretable and lightweight convolutional neural network for EEG decoding: Application to movement execution and imagination	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Convolutional neural network; Sinc-convolutional layer; Feature learning; Interpretability	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; COMPUTER; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; RHYTHM; TIME	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for EEG decoding: these techniques, by automatically learning relevant features for class discrimination, improve EEG decoding performances without relying on handcrafted features. Nevertheless, the learned features are difficult to interpret and most of the existing CNNs introduce many trainable parameters. Here, we propose a lightweight and interpretable shallow CNN (Sinc-ShallowNet), by stacking a temporal sinc-convolutional layer (designed to learn band-pass filters, each having only the two cut-off frequencies as trainable parameters), a spatial depthwise convolutional layer (reducing channel connectivity and learning spatial filters tied to each band-pass filter), and a fully-connected layer finalizing the classification. This convolutional module limits the number of trainable parameters and allows direct interpretation of the learned spectral-spatial features via simple kernel visualizations. Furthermore, we designed a post-hoc gradient-based technique to enhance interpretation by identifying the more relevant and more class-specific features. Sinc-ShallowNet was evaluated on benchmark motor-execution and motor-imagery datasets and against different design choices and training strategies. Results show that (i) Sinc-ShallowNet outperformed a traditional machine learning algorithm and other CNNs for EEG decoding; (ii) The learned spectral-spatial features matched well-known EEG motor-related activity; (iii) The proposed architecture performed better with a larger number of temporal kernels still maintaining a good compromise between accuracy and parsimony, and with a trialwise rather than a cropped training strategy. In perspective, the proposed approach, with its interpretative capacity, can be exploited to investigate cognitive motor aspects whose EEG correlates are yet scarcely known, potentially characterizing their relevant features.

Despite significant progress has been made in decoding emotion using supervised machine-learning methods, few studies applied data-driven, unsupervised approaches to explore the underlying EEG dynamics during an emotion experiment and examine how such dynamics correlate with subjective reports of emotion. This study employs the adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA), an unsupervised approach, to EEG data from the DEAP dataset where 32 subjects watched emotional videos. Empirical results showed that AMICA could learn distinct models that separated EEG date collected in the emotion experiment. The identified changes in EEG patterns were weakly-correlated with the four reported emotion scales, indicating the underlying EEG dynamics partially reflected the emotional activities as well as the emotion-irrelevant brain dynamics. Further, the correlations between EEG dynamics and individuals' subjective emotional ratings were significantly higher than those between the EEG and the average ratings from online raters. Finally, building an emotion-decoding model based on the EEG dynamics revealed a significantly better classification performance for valence ratings compared to arousal. This study demonstrated the use of AMICA in characterizing the EEG dynamics in emotion experiments and provided insight into the relationship between EEG and the reported emotional experiences. The unsupervised learning approach can be applied to studying emotion and other confounding factors such as emotion irrelevant EEG artifacts, thereby improving the performance of emotion decoding for EEG-based affective computing.

Deep learning (DL) has been utilized with great success across several domains. However, it remains an open question whether DL methods provide significant advances over traditional machine learning (ML) approaches for classification of imagined speech. Furthermore, hyperparameter (HP) optimization has been neglected in DL-EEG studies, resulting in the significance of its effects remaining uncertain. In this study, we aim to improve classification of imagined speech EEG by employing DL methods while also statistically evaluating the impact of HP optimization on classifier performance. We trained three distinct convolutional neural networks (CNN) on imagined speech EEG using a nested cross-validation approach to HP optimization. Each of the CNNs evaluated was designed specifically for EEG decoding. An imagined speech EEG dataset consisting of both words and vowels facilitated training on both sets independently. CNN results were compared with three benchmark ML methods: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis. Intra- and inter-subject methods of HP optimization were tested and the effects of HPs statistically analyzed. Accuracies obtained by the CNNs were significantly greater than the benchmark methods when trained on both datasets (words: 24.97%,p< 1 x 10(-7), chance: 16.67%; vowels: 30.00%,p< 1 x 10(-7), chance: 20%). The effects of varying HP values, and interactions between HPs and the CNNs were both statistically significant. The results of HP optimization demonstrate how critical it is for training CNNs to decode imagined speech.

Speech perception, production, and imagination often constitute phases of human communication. The primary goal of this article is to analyze the similarity between these three phases by studying electroencephalogram(EEG) patterns across these modalities, in order to establish their usefulness for brain computer interfaces. Neural decoding of speech using such non-invasive techniques necessitates the optimal choice of signal analysis and translation protocols. By employing selection-by-exclusion based temporal modeling algorithms, we discover fundamental syllable-like units that reveal similar set of signal signatures across all the three phases. Significantly higher than chance accuracies are recorded for single trial multi-unit EEG classification using machine learning approaches over three datasets across 30 subjects. Repeatability and subject independence tests performed at every step of the analysis further strengthens the findings and holds promise for translating brain signals to speech non-invasively.

However, it is a challenge to find a robust method supporting high-dimensional EEG data with low signal-to-noise ratios from multiple objects and multiple channels. To address this issue, a new ETR energy calculation method for learning the EEG patterns of brain activities using a convolutional neural network is reported. It is able to customize temporal ETR training and recognize multiple objects within a common learning model. Specifically, an open-access dataset from the 2008 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Competition IV-2a is used for classification of five classes containing four Motor Imagery actions and one relax action. The proposed classification framework outperforms the best state-of-the-art classification method by 10.11% in average subject accuracy. Furthermore, by studying the ETR parameter optimization, a user interface for BCI applications is obtained and a real-time method implemented. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because the cognitive mechanisms such as human sensation and perception from cognitive science are fast responses ranging from a few milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds, the method of pattern recognition and analysis of these brain signals must be done and it is necessary to derive some information. In this paper, we investigated time-series data of cognitive function of the brain obtained using a non-invasive technique on multiple channels via signal classification and analysis, using a cognitive science approach and experiments. The test dataset was collected in 19 channels using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) techniques with multiple rests and working conditions on eight subjects. From this perspective, the main contributions of this paper are that it completes the collection and analysis of cognitive-scientific time-series data and has scientific implications that extend to other integrated domains, energy, manufacturing, bioinformatics, and finance area. The use of Shapelet and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) classification techniques on brain signal time-series shows the potential to identify neuro-biological phenomena that can proactively signal a disease or disorder. EEG bandwidth and frequency-specific data have also been categorized as machine learning algorithms and have shown accurate patterns and trends in measuring cognitive functions of scientific, biological and academic importance.

Ever since that time, many researchers where captivated by the huge potential and list of possibilities that can be achieved if simply a digital machine can interpret human thoughts. In this work, we explore electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification, specifically for motor imagery (MI) tasks. Classification of MI tasks can be carried out by using machine learning and deep learning models, yet there is a trade between accuracy and computation time that needs to be maintained. The objective is to create a machine learning model that can be optimized for real-time classification while having a relatively acceptable classification accuracy. The proposed model relies on common spatial patter (CSP) for feature extraction as well as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification.

In electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs, a variety of physiological responses including P300, motor imagery, movement-related potential, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and slow cortical potential have been utilized. Because of the superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) together with quicker information transfer rate (ITR), the intentness of SSVEP-based BCIs is progressing significantly. This paper represents the feature extraction and classification frameworks to detect five classes EEG-SSVEP responses. The common-spatial pattern (CSP) has been employed to extract the features from SSVEP responses and these features have been classified through the support vector machine (SVM). The proposed architecture has achieved the highest classification accuracy of 88.3%. The experimental result proves that the proposed architecture could be utilized for the detection of SSVEP responses to develop any BCI applications.

At the same time, advances in information and sensor technologies have reduced caring costs, providing a potential pathway for developing healthcare services for AD patients. For instance, if a virtual reality (VR) system can provide emotion-adaptive content, the time that AD patients spend interacting with VR content is expected to be extended, allowing caregivers to focus on other tasks. As the first step towards this goal, in this study, we develop a classification model that detects AD patients' emotions (e.g., happy, peaceful, or bored). We first collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 30 Korean female AD patients who watched emotion-evoking videos at a medical rehabilitation center. We applied conventional machine learning algorithms, such as a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine, along with deep learning models of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. The best performance was obtained from MLP, which achieved an average accuracy of 70.97%; the RNN model's accuracy reached only 48.18%. Our study results open a new stream of research in the field of EEG-based emotion detection for patients with neurological disorders.

Nonetheless, the electroencephalography (EEG) pattern variations among different subjects necessitates collecting a large amount of labeled individual data for model training, which prolongs the calibration session. From the perspective of transfer learning, the model knowledge inherent in reference subjects incorporating few target EEG data have the potential to solve the above issue. Thus, a novel knowledge-leverage-based support matrix machine (KL-SMM) was developed to improve the classification performance when only a few labeled EEG data in the target domain (target subject) were available. The proposed KL-SMM possesses the powerful capability of a matrix learning machine, which allows it to directly learn the structural information from matrix-form EEG data. In addition, the KL-SMM can not only fully leverage few labeled EEG data from the target domain during the learning procedure but can also leverage the existing model knowledge from the source domain (source subject). Therefore, the KL-SMM can enhance the generalization performance of the target classifier while guaranteeing privacy protection to a certain extent. Finally, the objective function of the KL-SMM can be easily optimized using the alternating direction method of multipliers method. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the KL-SMM on publicly available MI-based EEG datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that the KL-SMM outperformed the comparable methods when the EEG data were insufficient.

J	van Vliet, M; Salmelin, R				van Vliet, Marijn; Salmelin, Riitta			Post-hoc modification of linear models: Combining machine learning with domain information to make solid inferences from noisy data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multivariate analysis; Linear model; Prior knowledge; Event-related potentials; N400; EEG	BRAIN; EEG; MEG; COMPONENT; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; PATTERNS; ARTIFACT; INVERSE	Linear machine learning models "learn" a data transformation by being exposed to examples of input with the desired output, forming the basis for a variety of powerful techniques for analyzing neuroimaging data. However, their ability to learn the desired transformation is limited by the quality and size of the example dataset, which in neuroimaging studies is often notoriously noisy and small. In these cases, it is desirable to fine-tune the learned linear model using domain information beyond the example dataset. To this end, we present a framework that decomposes the weight matrix of a fitted linear model into three subcomponents: the data covariance, the identified signal of interest, and a normalizer. Inspecting these subcomponents in isolation provides an intuitive way to inspect the inner workings of the model and assess its strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the three subcomponents may be altered, which provides a straightforward way to inject prior information and impose additional constraints. We refer to this process as "post-hoc modification" of a model and demonstrate how it can be used to achieve precise control over which aspects of the model are fitted to the data through machine learning and which are determined through domain information. As an example use case, we decode the associative strength between words from electroencephalography (EEG) reading data. Our results show how the decoding accuracy of two example linear models (ridge regression and logistic regression) can be boosted by incorporating information about the spatio-temporal nature of the data, domain information about the N400 evoked potential and data from other participants.

Prognosis may vary among patients depending on their seizure semiology, age of onset, seizure onset location, and features of electroencephalogram (EEG). Several researchers have focused on EEG patterns and demonstrated that EEG patterns of individuals with epilepsy can be used to predict prognosis and treatment responses. However, accurate EEG analysis requires an experienced epileptologist with several years of training, who are often unavailable in small or medium sized hospitals. In this paper, a novel machine learning (ML) model that accurately distinguishes Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS) from Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is proposed. BECTS and TLE show different seizure types and age of onset, but differential diagnosis can be challenging due to the similar location and patterns of the EEG spikes. The proposed hybrid machine learning (HML) model processes the diagnosis in the order of (1) creating feature matrices using statistical indexes after signal decomposition, (2) processing feature selection using Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology, and (3) classifying the results through ensemble learning based on decision trees. Simulation was performed using real patient data of 112 BECTS and 112 TLE EEG signals, where training was performed using 80% of the data and 20% of the data was used in the performance analysis comparison with the actual labeled data based on the diagnosis of medical doctors. The performance of the hybrid classification model is compared with other representative ML algorithms, which include logistic regression, KNN, SVM, and ensemble learning based decision tree. The model proposed in this paper shows an accuracy performance exceeding 99%, which is higher than the performance obtainable from the other ML classification models. The purpose of this study is to introduce a novel EEG diagnostic system that shows maximum efficiency to support clinical real-time diagnosis that can accurately distinguish epilepsy types. Future research will focus on expanding this ML model to categorize other types of epilepsies beyond BECTS and TLE and implement the HML diagnostic blockchain database into the hospital system.

They can be categorized into feature-based (with handcrafted features), and end-to-end approaches (with learned features). Previous studies on EEG pathology decoding have typically analyzed a limited number of features, decoders, or both. For a I) more elaborate feature-based EEG analysis, and II) in-depth comparisons of both approaches, here we first develop a comprehensive feature-based framework, and then compare this framework to state-of-the-art end-to-end methods. To this aim, we apply the proposed feature-based framework and deep neural networks including an EEG-optimized temporal convolutional network (TCN) to the task of pathological versus non-pathological EEG classification. For a robust comparison, we chose the Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG Corpus (v2.0.0), which contains approximately 3000 EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that the proposed featurebased decoding framework can achieve accuracies on the same level as state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find accuracies across both approaches in an astonishingly narrow range from 81 to 86%. Moreover, visualizations and analyses indicated that both approaches used similar aspects of the data, e.g., delta and theta band power at temporal electrode locations. We argue that the accuracies of current binary EEG pathology decoders could saturate near 90% due to the imperfect inter-rater agreement of the clinical labels, and that such decoders are already clinically useful, such as in areas where clinical EEG experts are rare. We make the proposed feature-based framework available open source and thus offer a new tool for EEG machine learning research.	[Gemein, Lukas A.

The present study was among the first to adopt a multivariate pattern classification analysis to decode electroencephalographic signals recorded for primary school children (N = 236) while performing a Chinese character decision task. Chinese is an ideal script for studying the relationship between neural discriminability (i.e., decodability) of the orthography and behavioral word reading skills since the mapping from orthography to phonology is relatively arbitrary in Chinese. This was also among the first empirical attempts to examine the extent to which decoding performance can predict current and subsequent word reading skills using a longitudinal design. Results showed that neural activation patterns of real characters can be distinguished from activation patterns for pseudo-characters, non-characters, and random stroke combinations in both younger and older children. Topography of the transformed classifier weights revealed two distinct cognitive sub-processes underlying single character recognition, but temporal generalization analysis suggested common neural mechanisms between the distinct cognitive sub-processes. Suggestive evidence from correlational and hierarchical regression analyses showed that decoding performance, assessed on average 2 months before the year 2 behavioral testing, predicted both year 1 word reading performance and the development of word reading fluency over the year. Results demonstrate that decoding performance, one indicator of how the neural system is functionally organized in processing characters and character-like stimuli, can serve as a useful neural marker in predicting current word reading skills and the capacity to learn to read.

Due to low spatial resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio of electroencephalogram (EEG), high accuracy classifications still suffer from lots of obstacles in the context of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-machine interface (BMI) systems. Particularly, it is extremely challenging to decode multiclass MI EEG from the same upper limb. This research proposes a novel feature learning approach to address the classification problem of 6-class MI tasks, including imaginary elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation, and hand close/open within the unilateral upper limb.Approach. Instead of the traditional common spatial pattern (CSP) or filter-bank CSP (FBCSP) manner, the Riemannian geometry (RG) framework involving Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean was directly adopted to extract tangent space (TS) features from spatial covariance matrices of the MI EEG trials. Subsequently, to reduce the dimensionality of the TS features, the algorithm of partial least squares regression was applied to obtain more separable and compact feature representations.Main results. The performance of the learned RG feature representations was validated by a linear discriminative analysis and support vector machine classifier, with an average accuracy of 80.50% and 79.70% on EEG dataset collected from 12 participants, respectively.Significance. These results demonstrate that compared with CSP and FBCSP features, the proposed approach can significantly increase the decoding accuracy for multiclass MI tasks from the same upper limb. This approach is promising and could potentially be applied in the context of MI-based BMI control of a robotic arm or a neural prosthesis for motor disabled patients with highly impaired upper limb.

Using machine learning techniques, we explored whether abnormalities in microstates can be used to classify patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We applied multivariate pattern analysis of microstate features to create a specified feature set to represent microstate characteristics. Machine learning approaches using these features for classification of patients with schizophrenia were compared with prior EEG based machine learning studies. Our microstate segmentation in both patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls yielded topographies that were similar to the normative database established earlier by Koenig et al. Our machine learning model was based on large sample size, low number of features and state-of-art K-fold cross-validation technique. The multivariate analysis revealed three patterns of correlated features, which yielded an AUC of 0.84 for the group separation (accuracy: 82.7%, sensitivity/specificity: 83.5%/85.3%). Microstate segmentation of resting state EEG results in informative features to discriminate patients with schizophrenia from healthy individuals. Moreover, alteration in microstate measures may represent disturbed activity of networks in patients with schizophrenia.

Specifically, we propose an EEG-based approach for decoding visually imagined objects by using the Choi-Williams time-frequency distribution to analyze the EEG signals in the joint time-frequency domain and extract a set of twelve time-frequency features (TFFs). The extracted TFFs are used to construct a multi-class support vector machine classifier to decode various visually imagined objects. To validate the performance of our proposed approach, we have recorded an EEG dataset for 16 healthy subjects while imagining objects that belong to four different categories, namely nature (fruits and animals), decimal digits, English alphabet (capital letters), and arrow shapes (arrows with different colors and orientations). Moreover, we have designed two performance evaluation analyses, namely the channel-based analysis and feature-based analysis, to quantify the impact of utilizing different groups of EEG electrodes that cover various regions on the scalp and the effect of reducing the dimensionality of the extracted TFFs on the performance of our proposed approach in decoding the imagined objects within each of the four categories. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in decoding visually imagined objects. Particularly, the average decoding accuracies obtained for each of the four categories were as high as 96.67%, 93.64%, 88.95%, and 92.68%.

Here, we show that MEG decoding accuracy improves significantly with the addition of feature selection methods to the analysis pipeline. We compare one unsupervised and two supervised feature reduction methods in the current study. Our results show that supervised feature selection methods like statistical dependency and mutual information improve decoding performance and attain higher session-to-session reliability compared to unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods like principal component analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the selected sensors in the data related to a visual task at each time point are consistent with the pattern reflecting the sweep of information in the ventral visual pathway.

Towards this, wearable technology, camera-based biophysical signals like electroencephalogram (EEG) approaches are utilised. In this Letter, the EEG-based approach is proposed to detect drowsiness. The proposed method consists of random sampling-based artificial signal augmentation, wavelet packet transform decomposition, logarithmic energy entropy, and one-dimensional region mean local binary pattern (1d-RMLBP) based feature extraction and classifier. k-Nearest neighbour and support vector machine classifiers are employed to detect the drowsiness. The MIT/BIH polysomnographic dataset has been used to test the proposed model. The proposed method has superior performance than the other methods using the same data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model could efficiently detect drowsiness from polysomnographic EEG signals.	[Alcin, OE.

Classifying creativity: Applying machine learning techniques to divergent thinking EEG data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Alpha; Classification; EEG; Creativity; AUT	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; EMOTION RECOGNITION; OSCILLATIONS; CONVERGENT; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS; MUSIC; STAGE	Prior research has shown that greater EEG alpha power (8-13 Hz) is characteristic of more creative individuals, and more creative task conditions. The present study investigated the potential for machine learning to classify more and less creative brain states. Participants completed an Alternate Uses Task, in which they thought of Normal or Uncommon (more creative) uses for everyday objects (e.g., brick). We hypothesized that alpha power would be greater for Uncommon (vs. Common) uses, and that a machine learning (ML) approach would enable the reliable classification data from the two conditions. Further, we expected that ML would be successful at classifying more (vs. less) creative individuals. As expected, alpha power was significantly greater for the Uncommon than for the Normal condition. Using spectrally weighted common spatial patterns to extract EEG features, and quadratic discriminant analysis, we found that classification accuracy for the two conditions varied widely among individuals, with a mean of 63.9%. For more vs. less creative individuals, 82.3% classification accuracy was attained. These findings indicate the potential for broader adoption of machine learning in creativity research.

However, the decoding of gait patterns from brain signals remains an open challenge. The aim of this work is to propose and validate a deep learning model to decode gait phases from Electroenchephalography (EEG).Approach.A Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network has been trained to deal with time-dependent information within brain signals during locomotion. The EEG signals have been preprocessed by means of Artifacts Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Reliable Independent Component Analysis (RELICA) to ensure that classification performance was not affected by movement-related artifacts.Main results.The network was evaluated on the dataset of 11 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. The proposed decoding approach shows a robust reconstruction (AUC > 90%) of gait patterns (i.e. swing and stance states) of both legs together, or of each leg independently.Significance.Our results support for the first time the use of a memory-based deep learning classifier to decode walking activity from non-invasive brain recordings. We suggest that this classifier, exploited in real time, can be a more effective input for devices restoring locomotion in impaired people.

However, the visual analysis of long-term EEG recordings is characterized by its subjectivity, time-consuming procedure and its erroneous detection. Various epileptic seizure detection algorithms have been proposed to deal with such issues. In this study, a novel automatic seizure-detection approach is proposed. Three different strategies are suggested to the user whereby he/she could choose the appropriate one for a given classification problem. Indeed, the feature extraction step, including both linear and nonlinear measures, is performed either directly from the EEG signals, or from the derived sub-bands of tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT), or even from the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). The classification procedure is executed using a support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a publicly available database from which six binary classification cases are formulated to discriminate between healthy, seizure and non-seizure EEG signals. Our results show high performance in terms of accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Thus, the proposed approach for automatic seizure detection can be considered as a valuable alternative to existing methods, able to alleviate the overload of visual analysis and accelerate the seizure detection.

MI EEG decoding has a core problem which is extracting as many multiple types of features as possible from the multi-channel time series of EEG to understand brain activity accurately. Recently, deep learning technology has been widely used in EEG decoding. However, the variability of the simple network framework is insufficient to satisfy the complex task of EEG decoding. A multi-scale fusion convolutional neural network based on the attention mechanism (MS-AMF) is proposed in this paper. The network extracts spatio temporal multi-scale features from multi-brain regions representation signals and is supplemented by a dense fusion strategy to retain the maximum information flow. The attention mechanism we added to the network has improved the sensitivity of the network. The experimental results show that the network has a better classification effect compared with the baseline method in the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset. We conducted visualization analysis in multiple parts of the network, and the results show that the attention mechanism is also convenient for analyzing the underlying information flow of EEG decoding, which verifies the effectiveness of the MS-AMF method.

A novel method of motor imagery classification using eeg signal	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; BCI; Principal component analysis; ELM; Fisher's linear discriminant	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE	A subject of extensive research interest in the Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) niche is motor imagery (MI), where users imagine limb movements to control the system. This interest is owed to the immense potential for its applicability in gaming, neuro-prosthetics and neuro-rehabilitation, where the user's thoughts of imagined movements need to be decoded. Electroencephalography (EEG) equipment is commonly used for keeping track of cerebrum movement in BCI systems. The EEG signals are recognized by feature extraction and classification. The current research proposes a Hybrid-KELM (Kernel Extreme Learning Machine) method based on PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and FLD (Fisher's Linear Discriminant) for MI BCI classification of EEG data. The performance and results of the method are demonstrated using BCI competition dataset III, and compared with those of contemporary methods. The proposed method generated an accuracy of 96.54%.

In recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on electroencephalography (EEG) have developed rapidly. However, the decoding of voluntary finger pre-movements from EEG is still a challenge for BCIs. This study aimed to analyze the pre-movement EEG features in time and frequency domains and design an efficient method to decode the movement-related patterns. Approach. In this study, we first investigated the EEG features induced by the intention of left and right finger movements. Specifically, the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) features were extracted using discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM) and common spatial patterns (CSP), respectively. Then, the two types of features were classified by two fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) classifiers, respectively. Their decision values were further assembled to facilitate the classification. To verify the validity of the proposed method, a private dataset containing 12 subjects and a public dataset from BCI competition II were used for estimating the classification accuracy. Main results. As a result, for the private dataset, the combination of DCPM and CSP achieved an average accuracy of 80.96%, which was 5.08% higher than the single DCPM method (p < 0.01) and 10.23% higher than the single CSP method (p < 0.01). Notably, the highest accuracy could achieve 91.5% for the combination method. The test accuracy of dataset IV of BCI competition II was 90%, which was equal to the best result in the existing literature. Significance. The results demonstrate the MRCP and ERD features of pre-movements contain significantly discriminative information, which are complementary to each other, and thereby could be well recognized by the proposed combination method of DCPM and CSP. Therefore, this study provides a promising approach for the decoding of pre-movement EEG patterns, which is significant for the development of BCIs.

At the same time, optimizing the EEG channel combinations is another key issue that substantially affects the SMR feature representations. Although numerous algorithms have been developed to find channels that record important characteristics of MI, most of them select channels in a cumbersome way with low computational efficiency, thereby limiting the practicality of MI-based BCI systems. In this study, we propose the multi-scale optimization (MSO) of spatial patterns, optimizing filter bands over multiple channel sets within CSPs to further improve the performance of MI-based BCI. Specifically, several channel subsets are first heuristically predefined, and then raw EEG data specific to each of these subsets bandpass-filtered at the overlap between a set of filter bands. Further, instead of solving learning problems for each channel subset independently, we propose a multi-view learning based sparse optimization to jointly extract robust CSP features with L-2,L-1-norm regularization, aiming to capture the shared salient information across multiple related spatial patterns for enhanced classification performance. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is then trained on these optimized EEG features for accurate recognition of MI tasks. Experimental results on three public EEG datasets validate the effectiveness of MSO compared to several other competing methods and their variants. These superior experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSO method has promising potential in MI-based BCIs.

By identifying brain activity patterns and their correspondence between symptoms and diseases, it is possible to give an accurate diagnosis and appropriate drug therapy to patients. This work aims to categorize electroencephalography signals on different channels' recordings for classifying and predicting epileptic seizures. The collection of the electroencephalography recordings contained in the dataset attributes 179 information and 11,500 instances. Instances are of five categories, where one is the symptoms of epilepsy seizure. We have used traditional, ensemble methods and deep machine learning techniques highlighting their performance for the epilepsy seizure detection task. One dimensional convolutional neural network, ensemble machine learning techniques like bagging, boosting (AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and XG boosting), and stacking is implemented. Traditional machine learning techniques such as decision tree, random forest, extra tree, ridge classifier, logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes (gaussian), and Kernel Support Vector Machine (polynomial, gaussian) are used for classifying and predicting epilepsy seizure. Before using ensemble and traditional techniques, we have preprocessed the data set using the Karl Pearson coefficient of correlation to eliminate irrelevant attributes. Further accuracy of classification and prediction of the classifiers are manipulated using k-fold cross-validation methods and represent the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve for each classifier. After sorting and comparing algorithms, we have found the convolutional neural network and extra tree bagging classifiers to have better performance than all other ensemble and traditional classifiers.

It is therefore of great importance to reduce this risky factor by detecting the driver's drowsiness condition. This study aimed to detect drivers' drowsiness using an advanced electroencephalography (EEG)-based classification technique. We first collected EEG data from six healthy adults under two different awareness conditions (wakefulness and drowsiness) in a virtual driving experiment. Five different machine learning techniques, including the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM), and the proposed modified hierarchical extreme learning machine algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO-H-ELM), were applied to classify the subject's drowsiness based on the power spectral density (PSD) feature extracted from the EEG data. The mean accuracies of the five classifiers were 79.31%, 79.31%, 74.08%, 81.67%, and 83.12%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of our new PSO-H-ELM algorithm in detecting drivers' drowsiness, compared to the other techniques.

In this study, existing linear models that learn the mapping from neural activity to an attended speech envelope are replaced by a non-linear neural network (NN). The proposed architecture takes into account the temporal context of the estimated envelope and is evaluated using EEG data obtained from 20 normal-hearing listeners who focused on one speaker in a two-speaker setting. The network is optimized with respect to the frequency range and the temporal segmentation of the EEG input, as well as the cost function used to estimate the model parameters. To identify the salient cues involved in auditory attention, a relevance algorithm is applied that highlights the electrode signals most important for attention decoding. In contrast to linear approaches, the NN profits from a wider EEG frequency range (1-32 Hz) and achieves a performance seven times higher than the linear baseline. Relevant EEG activations following the speech stimulus after 170 ms at physiologically plausible locations were found. This was not observed when the model was trained on the unattended speaker. Our findings therefore indicate that non-linear NNs can provide insight into physiological processes by analyzing EEG activity.

However, individual differences of cortical responses from the BCI users has become an obstacle to inter-subject emotion recognition. In this study, a locally-robust feature selection (LRFS) method has been proposed to find generic feature subsets of the electroencephalography (EEG) within a group of accessible subjects. The LRFS first modeled EEG features by using different probability densities. By quantitatively measuring the similarity of the estimated density functions, inter-intersubject consistency of each EEG feature is represented. By ordering the values of the consistency, the locally-robust EEG features can be properly selected. To fuse the selected features, we follow the ensemble learning principle to build a classification committee. Based on the public DEAP database, the inter-subject classification accuracy of arousal and valence dimensions for the LRFS-based classifier is achieved by 0.65 and 0.68, respectively. The competiveness of the LRFS has been demonstrated when we compared it with the several existing feature selection methods.

In this work, a channel selection method is proposed to achieve efficient spatial pattern. First,it extracts the linear and nonlinear multi-features of the entire brain EEG signal and applies the Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF) multiple classifiers for classification. It is found that the nonlinear feature has a better classification performance in the memory material classification task (images vs characters) based on scalp EEG signals of the working memory maintenance procedure. Then the SVM is applied for classification on each channel by using the nonlinear feature. The top-10 channels with better classification performance are proved as the specific spatial pattern of the working memory maintenance procedure based on working memory materials. The channel selection method proposed in this paper can be extended to other classification analysis of cognitive tasks to extract the efficient spatial patterns.

Motor imagery (MI) paradigm is widely used in non-invasive BCI to control external devices by decoding user intentions. The traditional MI-BCI problem is to obtain enough EEG data samples for adopting deep learning techniques, as electroencephalography (EEG) data have intricate and non-stationary properties that can cause a discrepancy between different sessions of data. Because of the discrepancy, the recorded EEG data with different sessions cannot be treated as the same. In this study, we recorded a large intuitive EEG dataset that contained nine types of movements of a single-arm across 12 subjects. We proposed a SessionNet that learns generality with EEG data recorded over multiple sessions using feature similarity to improve classification performance. Additionally, the SessionNet adopts the principle of a hierarchical convolutional neural network that shows robust classification performance regardless of the number of classes. The SessionNet outperforms conventional methods on 3-class, 5-class, and two types of 7-class and 9-class of a single-arm task. Hence, our approach could demonstrate the possibility of using feature similarity based on a novel ensemble learning method to train generality from multiple session data for better MI classification performance.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has its advantages over other brainwave monitoring tools in cost, portability and monitoring frequency and accuracy. The interpretation of the relatively large amount of EEG signals is of key importance to understand brain functionality. Traditional machine learning and signal preprocessing methods alone fail to provide robust and in-time EEG signal interpretation and partially relied on professionally trained expert. For further developments and applications of robust and in-time EEG interpretation, we investigated the application of the deep learning models on a classification task of a motor imagery EEG signal dataset with both spatial and temporal information. We adopt sliding window with specified window sizes and strides to generate training samples for deep learning models and standardize the training samples to improve the model performance. Convolutional neural network, variants of recurrent neural network are investigated and compared on the classification and interpretation performance over the interested dataset. The convolutional neural network demonstrates superior performance in terms of both training efficiency and accuracy to other models.

Hence, researchers are using machine learning and deep learning techniques for decoding MI signals. The properties of EEG signals like a low signal to noise ratio and its dynamic nature make it more complex and harder to decode. Research has shown that EEG has both spatial and temporal characteristics which can be exploited by deep learning models like convolution neural networks (CNN). This paper shows that the multilevel CNN model can extract dynamic correlations from EEG MI data. Multilevel CNN models are fused using autoencoder to extract the best features for EEG data which help improve MI decoding accuracy. The proposed fusion methods give a good performance for EEG decoding when tested for within-subject trials as well as cross trials. The results are compared with state-of-the art-techniques on public EEG dataset BCI competition IV 2a. Novel cross encoding technique is also proposed which helps us achieve big improvement in crosssubject EEG decoding.

One method mostly taken to overcome this problem is by collecting as many subjects as possible and then training the system across all subjects. This article introduces streaming online learning called autonomous deep learning (ADL) to classify five individual fingers based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals to overcome the issue above. ADL is a deep learning architecture that can construct its structure by itself through streaming learning and adapt its structure to the changes occurring in the input. In this article, the input of ADL is a common spatial pattern (CSP) extracted from the EEG signal of healthy subjects. The experimental results on the subject-dependence classification across four subjects using 5-fold cross-validation show that that ADL achieved the classification accuracy of around 77%. This performance was excellent compared to a random forest (RF) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). They achieved accuracies of about 53% and 72%, respectively. On the subject-independent classification, ADL outperforms CNN by resulting stable accuracies for both training and testing, different from CNN that experience accuracy degradation to approximately 50%. These results imply that ADL is a promising machine learning in dealing with the issue in the subject-independent classification.

J	Amin, HU; Yusoff, MZ; Ahmad, RF				Amin, Hafeez Ullah; Yusoff, Mohd Zuki; Ahmad, Rana Fayyaz			A novel approach based on wavelet analysis and arithmetic coding for automated detection and diagnosis of epileptic seizure in EEG signals using machine learning techniques	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Epileptic seizure; Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Arithmetic coding; Machine learning classifiers; Computer-aided diagnostic	NEURAL-NETWORK; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BINARY PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; STATISTICS; ALGORITHMS; TRANSFORM; SYSTEM	Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder, is generally detected by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Visual inspection and interpretation of EEGs is a slow, time consuming process that is vulnerable to error and subjective variability. Consequently, several efforts to develop automatic epileptic seizure detection and classification methods have been made. The present study proposes a novel computer aided diagnostic technique (CAD) based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and arithmetic coding to differentiate epileptic seizure signals from normal (seizure-free) signals. The proposed CAD technique comprises three steps. The first step decomposes EEG signals into approximations and detail coefficients using DWT while discarding non-significant coefficients in view of threshold criteria; thus, limiting the number of significant wavelet coefficients. The second step converts significant wavelet coefficients to bit streams using arithmetic coding to compute the compression ratio. In the final step, the compression feature set is standardized, whereupon machine-learning classifiers detect seizure activity from seizure-free signals. We employed the widely used benchmark database from Bonn University to compare and validate the technique with results from prior approaches. The proposed method achieved a perfect classification performance (100% accuracy) for the detection of epileptic seizure activity from EEG data, using both linear and non-liner machine-learning classifiers. This CAD technique can thus be considered robust with an extraordinary detection capability that discriminates epileptic seizure activity from seizure-free and normal EEG activity with simple linear classifiers. The method has the potential for efficient application as an adjunct for the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studies that investigate them and their relationship with brain activity changes have been increasing due to the possible application in an intuitive brain-machine interface (BMI). In addition, the distinctive patterns when presenting different visual stimuli that make data differentiable enough to be classified have been studied. However, reported classification accuracy still low or employed techniques for obtaining brain signals are impractical to use in real environments. In this study, we aim to decode electroencephalography (EEG) signals depending on the provided visual stimulus. Subjects were presented with 72 photographs belonging to 6 different semantic categories. We classified 6 categories and 72 exemplars according to visual stimuli using EEG signals. In order to achieve a high classification accuracy, we proposed an attention driven convolutional neural network and compared our results with conventional methods used for classifying EEG signals. We reported an accuracy of 50.37 +/- 6.56% and 26.75 +/- 10.38% for 6-class and 72-class, respectively. These results statistically outperformed other conventional methods. This was possible because of the application of the attention network using human visual pathways. Our findings showed that EEG signals are possible to differentiate when subjects are presented with visual stimulus of different semantic categories and at an exemplar-level with a high classification accuracy; this demonstrates its viability to be applied it in a real-world BMI.

A first step to uncovering the neural correlates of curiosity is to collect neurophysiological signals during states of curiosity, in order to develop signal processing and machine learning (ML) tools to recognize the curious states from the non-curious ones. Thus, we ran an experiment in which we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the brain activity of participants as they were induced into states of curiosity, using trivia question and answer chains. We used two ML algorithms, i.e. Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) coupled with a Linear Discriminant Algorithm (LDA), as well as a Filter Bank Tangent Space Classifier (FBTSC), to classify the curious EEG signals from the non-curious ones. Global results indicate that both algorithms obtained better performances in the 3-to-5s time windows, suggesting an optimal time window length of 4 seconds (63.09% classification accuracy for the FBTSC, 60.93% classification accuracy for the FBCSP+LDA) to go towards curiosity states estimation based on EEG signals.

The process of extracting that information of rich electrical activity through noninvasive electrodes is called Electroencephalography (EEG). With the recent surge and advancement in machine learning technology and computational power, the information is further processed to extract patterns in order to derive knowledge. The synthesized knowledge can be used in any desired fashion, ranging from executing commands to analyzing patterns. In recent times, EEG has been a compelling candidate to directly interact with different interfaces just through our brain waves, without depending upon muscular movements and peripheral nerves. It also extends its applicability in various fields, such as psychology, robotics, and cybersecurity, and aiding in the treatment and rehabilitation of various neurological disorders. In this paper, we review what has been out by the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. It helps readers, novice to experts, understand two areas:(1) Latest developments in the brain-computer interface (BCI) field, and (2) Different devices and their properties used to execute those developments. The aim of this paper is to help promote advancement and further development in this area.

An important issue for passive BCIs is to monitor the attentional state of the brain. Previous studies mainly focus on the classification of attention levels, i.e. high vs. low levels, but few has investigated the classification of attention focuses during speech perception. In this paper, we tried to use electroencephalography (EEG) to recognize the subject's attention focuses on either call sign or number when listening to a short sentence. Fifteen subjects participated in this study, and they were required to focus on either call sign or number for each listening task. A new algorithm was proposed to classify the EEG patterns of different attention focuses, which combined common spatial pattern (CSP), short-time Fourier transformation (STFT) and discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM). As a result, the accuracy reached an average of 78.38% with a peak of 93.93% for single trial classification. The results of this study demonstrate the proposed algorithm is effective to classify the auditory attention focuses during speech perception.

Privacy concerns associated with EEG signals limit the possibility of constructing a large EEG-BCI dataset by the conglomeration of multiple small ones for jointly training machine learning models. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving DL architecture named federated transfer learning (FTL) for EEG classification that is based on the federated learning framework. Working with the single-trial covariance matrix, the proposed architecture extracts common discriminative information from multi-subject EEG data with the help of domain adaptation techniques. We evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on the PhysioNet dataset for 2-class motor imagery classification. While avoiding the actual data sharing, our FTL approach achieves 2% higher classification accuracy in a subject-adaptive analysis. Also, in the absence of multi-subject data, our architecture provides 6% better accuracy compared to other stateof-the-art DL architectures.

However, they are very weak and sensitive to the experimental settings including paradigms, stimulation parameters and even surrounding environments, resulting in a diversity of ERP patterns across different BCI experiments. It's still a challenge to develop a general decoding algorithm that can adapt to the ERP diversities of different BCI datasets with small training sets. This study compared a recently developed algorithm, i.e., discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM), with seven ERP-BCI classification methods, i.e., linear discriminant analysis (LDA), stepwise LDA, bayesian LDA, shrinkage LDA, spatial-temporal discriminant analysis (STDA), xDAWN and EEGNet for the single-trial classification of two private EEG datasets and three public EEG datasets with small training sets. The feature ERPs of the five datasets included P300, motion visual evoked potential (mVEP), and miniature asymmetric visual evoked potential (aVEP). Study results showed that the DCPM outperformed other classifiers for all of the tested datasets, suggesting the DCPM is a robust classification algorithm for assessing a wide range of ERP components.

The EEG collection was carried out while the subjects were driving in simulated condition in a laboratory, where the fatigue level propagates through 11 different stages of fatigue, to achieve the sleep deprivation of a total period of 36 h. Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) algorithm has been used here for estimating the source activations on the surface of the neo-cortex. sLORETA transforms the surface or scalp EEG data to the corresponding corticular dipole sources at each voxel on a simulated neo-cortex. For the characterization of the underlying neural patterns, approximate and sample entropies in voxels nearest to specific electrodes for different subjects and varying fatigue levels have been computed. Approximate entropy, sample entropy, and modified sample entropy are used here as the measures of complexity, similarity, and regularity in the sources. As a further investigation, these measures computed over all the stages are used to train a support vector machine, which classifies the measured values between alert and extremely fatigued states. As a result, several observations on the nature of change of the chaotic entropies are provided, and up to 86 classification accuracy is obtained.

Paired Trial Classification: A Novel Deep Learning Technique for MVPA	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; MVPA; deep learning; machine learning; cognitive neuroscience	NEURAL-NETWORKS; FACE	Many recent developments in machine learning have come from the field of "deep learning," or the use of advanced neural network architectures and techniques. While these methods have produced state-of-the-art results and dominated research focus in many fields, such as image classification and natural language processing, they have not gained as much ground over standard multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques in the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) or other human neuroscience datasets. The high dimensionality and large amounts of noise present in EEG data, coupled with the relatively low number of examples (trials) that can be reasonably obtained from a sample of human subjects, lead to difficulty training deep learning models. Even when a model successfully converges in training, significant overfitting can occur despite the presence of regularization techniques. To help alleviate these problems, we present a new method of "paired trial classification" that involves classifying pairs of EEG recordings as coming from the same class or different classes. This allows us to drastically increase the number of training examples, in a manner akin to but distinct from traditional data augmentation approaches, through the combinatorics of pairing trials. Moreover, paired trial classification still allows us to determine the true class of a novel example (trial) via a "dictionary" approach: compare the novel example to a group of known examples from each class, and determine the final class via summing the same/different decision values within each class. Since individual trials are noisy, this approach can be further improved by comparing a novel individual example with a "dictionary" in which each entry is an average of several examples (trials). Even further improvements can be realized in situations where multiple samples from a single unknown class can be averaged, thus permitting averaged signals to be compared with averaged signals.

An accurate detection of P300 response in electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used to design P300-based BCIs to improve social attention in Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Recently, there was a growing interest in the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to decode P300 in an end-to-end fashion. However, the complexity of these models needs to be carefully taken into account. In this study, a lightweight CNN previously validated for P300 detection (EEGNet) was used to decode which object ASD participants were paying attention to in a virtual environment. Two learning strategies were deepened: within-session and cross-session trainings. Cross-session training resulted in a higher target object accuracy scoring 92.27% on average across sessions and subjects, and in a lower decoding variability across sessions.

In this Letter, the classification of different working memory load levels is presented using a hybrid BCI system. N-back cognitive tasks such as 0-back, 2-back, and 3-back are used to create working memory load on participants while recording EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals simultaneously. A combination of statistically significant features obtained from EEG and fNIRS corresponding to frontal region channels are used to classify different N-back commands. Kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are employed with and without cross-validation schemes. Classification accuracy of 100% is achieved for binary classification of 0-back against 2-back and 0-back against 3-back using linear SVM, quadratic SVM, and cubic SVM under holdout data division protocol.

J	Valentin, S; Harkotte, M; Popov, T				Valentin, Simon; Harkotte, Maximilian; Popov, Tzvetan			Interpreting neural decoding models using grouped model reliance	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG-DATA; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; INFERENCE; PATTERNS; CODES	Author summary Modern machine learning algorithms currently receive considerable attention for their predictive power in neural decoding applications. However, there is a need for methods that make such predictive models interpretable. In the present work, we address the problem of assessing which aspects of the input data a trained model relies upon to make predictions. We demonstrate the use of grouped model reliance as a generally applicable method for interpreting neural decoding models. Illustrating the method on a case study, we employed an experimental design in which a comparably small number of participants (10) completed a large number of trials (972) over three electroencephalography (EEG) recording sessions from a Sternberg working memory task. Trained decoding models consistently relied on predictor variables from the alpha frequency band, which is in line with existing research on the relationship between neural oscillations and working memory. However, our analyses also indicate large inter-individual variability with respect to the relation between activity patterns and working memory load in frequency and topography. We argue that grouped model reliance provides a useful tool to better understand the workings of (sometimes otherwise black box) decoding models. Machine learning algorithms are becoming increasingly popular for decoding psychological constructs based on neural data. However, as a step towards bridging the gap between theory-driven cognitive neuroscience and data-driven decoding approaches, there is a need for methods that allow to interpret trained decoding models. The present study demonstrates grouped model reliance as a model-agnostic permutation-based approach to this problem. Grouped model reliance indicates the extent to which a trained model relies on conceptually related groups of variables, such as frequency bands or regions of interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. As a case study to demonstrate the method, random forest and support vector machine models were trained on within-participant single-trial EEG data from a Sternberg working memory task. Participants were asked to memorize a sequence of digits (0-9), varying randomly in length between one, four and seven digits, where EEG recordings for working memory load estimation were taken from a 3-second retention interval. The present results confirm previous findings insofar as both random forest and support vector machine models relied on alpha-band activity in most subjects. However, as revealed by further analyses, patterns in frequency and topography varied considerably between individuals, pointing to more pronounced inter-individual differences than previously reported.

Six subjects were asked to perform covert speech tasks i.e mental repetition of four different words i.e 'left', 'right', 'up' and 'down'. Fifty trials for each word recorded for every subject. Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine (kernel ELM) was used for multiclass and binary classification of EEG signals of covert speech words. We achieved a maximum multiclass and binary classification accuracy of (49.77%) and (85.57%) respectively. The kernel ELM achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to some of the most commonly used classification algorithms in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Our findings suggested that covert speech EEG signals could be successfully classified using kernel ELM. This research involving the classification of covert speech words potentially leading to real-time silent speech BCI research.

We used multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) to investigate whether the time course of the deployment of covert spatial attention leading up to the observer's perceptual decision can be decoded from both EEG alpha power and raw activity traces. Decoding attention from these signals can help determine whether raw EEG signals and alpha power reflect the same or distinct features of attentional selection. Using a classical cueing task, we showed that the orientation of covert spatial attention can be decoded by both signals. However, raw activity and alpha power may reflect different features of spatial attention, with alpha power more associated with the orientation of covert attention in space and raw activity with the influence of attention on perceptual processes.

J	Tamm, MO; Muhammad, Y; Muhammad, N				Tamm, Markus-Oliver; Muhammad, Yar; Muhammad, Naveed			Classification of Vowels from Imagined Speech with Convolutional Neural Networks	COMPUTERS			English	Article						EEG; imagined speech; machine learning; convolutional neural networks; transfer learning		Imagined speech is a relatively new electroencephalography (EEG) neuro-paradigm, which has seen little use in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Imagined speech can be used to allow physically impaired patients to communicate and to use smart devices by imagining desired commands and then detecting and executing those commands in a smart device. The goal of this research is to verify previous classification attempts made and then design a new, more efficient neural network that is noticeably less complex (fewer number of layers) that still achieves a comparable classification accuracy. The classifiers are designed to distinguish between EEG signal patterns corresponding to imagined speech of different vowels and words. This research uses a dataset that consists of 15 subjects imagining saying the five main vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and six different words. Two previous studies on imagined speech classifications are verified as those studies used the same dataset used here. The replicated results are compared. The main goal of this study is to take the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model from one of the replicated studies and make it much more simpler and less complex, while attempting to retain a similar accuracy. The pre-processing of data is described and a new CNN classifier with three different transfer learning methods is described and used to classify EEG signals. Classification accuracy is used as the performance metric. The new proposed CNN, which uses half as many layers and less complex pre-processing methods, achieved a considerably lower accuracy, but still managed to outperform the initial model proposed by the authors of the dataset by a considerable margin. It is recommended that further studies investigating classifying imagined speech should use more data and more powerful machine learning techniques. Transfer learning proved beneficial and should be used to improve the effectiveness of neural networks.

It provides native implementations of a range of classifiers and regression models, using modern optimization algorithms. High-level functions allow for the multivariate analysis of multi-dimensional data, including generalization (e.g., time x time) and searchlight analysis. The toolbox performs cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and nested preprocessing. It computes various classification and regression metrics and establishes their statistical significance, is modular and easily extendable. Furthermore, it offers interfaces for LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR as well as an integration into the FieldTrip neuroimaging toolbox. After introducing MVPA-Light, example analyses of MEG and fMRI datasets, and benchmarking results on the classifiers and regression models are presented.

In this work, we propose a novel entropy-based machine learning method to classify between standing and walking conditions from the sole brain activity. The Shannon entropy has been used as a complexity measure of electroencephalography (EEG) signals and subject-specific features for classification have been selected by Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) filter. Exploiting these features with a linear classifier, we achieved > 85% of classification accuracy over a long period (approximate to 25 min) of standing and treadmill walking on 11 healthy subjects. Moreover, we implemented the proposed approach to successfully discriminate in real-time between standing and over-ground walking on one healthy subject. We suggest that the reliable discrimination of rest against walking conditions achieved by the proposed method may be exploited to have more stable control of devices to restore locomotion, avoiding unpredictable and dangerous behaviors due to the delivery of undesired control commands.

J	Chan, KY; Arndt, S; Engelke, U				Chan, Kit Yan; Arndt, Sebastian; Engelke, Ulrich			A novel strategy for classifying perceived video quality using electroencephalography signals	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Video quality; Electroencephalography; Quality of experience; Affective computing; Classification	P300; EEG	Video streaming through the Internet is abundant nowadays. While video quality is continuously demanded, monitoring users' quality of experience (QoE) is essential when watching video contents. QoE can be evaluated directly through subjective assessment which is the human ground truths; however, such assessment is generally expensive and time consuming, and cannot be implemented in real time. QoE can also be evaluated by video quality models; however, the evaluation is fully based on video contents but human physical states cannot be taken into account. To tackle the limitations, detection of a prominent electroencephalography (EEG) signal feature namely P300 correlated to QoE can be used, when users are viewing videos. P300 is a positive deflection pulse that appears around 300 ms after a significant video distortion appears. QoE can be indicated by P300 pulses. However, the captured EEG signal is generally contaminated with noise. Strong noise generates P300 although video carries no distortion. Hence, detections of P300 patterns are not accurate. In this paper, a double classifier consisting of a first and second classifier is proposed. The first classifier attempts to determine whether the captured EEG feature is abnormal or not, where the abnormal caption behaves opposite to the normal P300 characteristic when showing the distorted video. The second classifier is developed to perform classifications for either normal or abnormal features. We evaluate the performance of the proposed double classifier based on the EEG samples, which are captured when showing video stimuli to participants. The proposed classifier is implemented by the support vector machine and logistic regression, which are commonly used for detection of EEG patterns and are computationally much simpler than deep learning. The performance of the proposed classifier is compared to those of the single classifiers, which determine the QoE directly when the EEG signal is given. Cross-validations showed that generally more than 5% improvement can be achieved by the proposed double classifier. Statistical tests indicate that the proposed double classifier can generally obtain better classification rates than solely using the single classifier at a 97.5% confidence level.

Currently, one of the most interesting researches in BCIs is to develop methods for decoding people's intent from the neural signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the ideal solution that provides a portable recording system of neural signals. One of the challenges is to decode people's intended movement based on EEG. Machine learning is a powerful tools and has been used in BCIs. Due to the large-scale computations, the model training process for machine learning is not always efficient. In order to address such challenges of electroencephalogram modeling in BCIs, we present an efficient machine learning algorithm based on normal equation. First, we propose a systolic matrix multiplication of two matrices. Second, we propose a systolic matrix inversion for large matrix. Third, we propose a systolic matrix-vector multiplication. In addition, the efficiency of the machine learning algorithm is analyzed and its applications of electroencephalogram modeling in BCIs are discussed.

Existing pilot behavior studies such as behavior modeling methods based on domain experts and behavior modeling methods based on knowledge discovery do not proceed from the characteristics of the pilots themselves. The experiment starts directly from the multimodal physiological characteristics to explore pilots' behavior. Electroencephalography, electrocardiogram, and eye movement were recorded simultaneously. Extracted multimodal features of ground missions, air missions, and cruise mission were trained to generate support vector machine behavior model based on supervised learning. The results showed that different behaviors affects different multiple rhythm features, which are power spectra of the. waves of EEG, standard deviation of normal to normal, root mean square of standard deviation and average gaze duration. The different physiological characteristics of the pilots could also be distinguished using an SVM model.

J	Tang, FG; Liu, Y; Li, Y; Peng, ZW				Tang, Fang-Gui; Liu, Yu; Li, Yang; Peng, Zi-Wen			A unified multi-level spectral-temporal feature learning framework for patient-specific seizure onset detection in EEG signals	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Seizure onset detection; Multi-domain feature extraction; Deep learning; Multivariate multiscale sample entropy; Common spatial pattern	WAVELET TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	Epileptic seizure onset detection in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a challenging task due to the severe variation of seizures. Recently, automatic seizure onset detection frameworks fail to fully consider both nonstationary and stochastic characteristics of EEGs in nature, which may lead to information default and further produce suboptimal recognition performance consequently. In this work, we propose a patient-specific seizure onset detection method based on fully exploration of auxiliary supplementary spectral-temporal information in EEG signals. Specifically, prior to feature extraction procedure, EEG signals are firstly decomposed into 5 groups of coefficients at different levels based on the clinical interest. Representative feature in temporal-domain, which is a translation of the nonlinear property of EEG signals, is then extracted by a combination of principal component analysis and common spatial pattern (PCA-CSP) and multivariate multiscale sample entropy (MMSE) in parallel and dimensionally reduced by a tree-based feature selection algorithm. Supplementary information in spectral-domain is further explored by the proposed unified maximum mean discrepancy autoencoder (uMMD-AE). Finally, an optimal combination of features above is identified and fed into a series of support vector machine classifiers with a decision fusion module for the intelligent recognition of epileptic EEGs. The proposed method achieves an average sensitivity, latency and false detection rate of 97.2%, 1.10s and 0.64/h respectively on Children Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) Scalp EEG Database. Competitive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed unified multi-level spectral-temporal feature learning framework in epileptic EEG recognition, validating its effectiveness in the automatic patient-specific seizure onset detection.

LRFBCSP approach selects the MI-relevant local region which is constructed by individual channels and their neighbors by comparing their eigenvalue disparity. We propose an extension version of the LRFBCSP by considering the complex-valued spatial filtering rather than the real-valued spatial filtering. The complex-valued spatial filtering improves the discrimination of each local region and provides enhanced CSP features.

The instrument exploits EEG robustness to movement artifacts with respect to other biosignals for stress assessment. The single-channel differential measurement aims at analyzing the frontal asymmetry, a well-claimed EEG feature for stress assessment. The instrument was characterized metrologically on human subjects. As triple metrological references, standardized stress tests, observational questionnaires given by psychologists, and performance measurements were exploited. Four standard machine learning classifiers (SVM, k-NN, random forest, and ANN), trained on 50% of the data set, reached more than 90% accuracy in classifying each 2-s epoch of EEG acquired from the stressed subjects.

Machine learning techniques are increasingly adopted to classify single-trial EEG responses thereby primarily relying on amplitude-based features instead of latency-based features. In this study, we investigated changes in EEG response signatures of nine healthy older subjects when performing 10 sessions of covert attention training. We show that, when we trained classifiers to distinguish recorded EEC patterns between the two experimental conditions (a target stimulus is "present" or "not present"), latency-based classifiers outperform the amplitude-based ones and that classification accuracy improved along with behavioral accuracy, providing supportive evidence of brain plasticity.

In the first step we present the idea to unfold the EEG standard bandwidths in a more fine-graded equidistant 99-point spectrum to improve accuracy when diagnosing diseases. We use this novel pre-processing step prior to entering a Random Forests classifier. In the second step we evaluate the approach on alcoholism and epilepsy and demonstrate that the approach outperforms all benchmarks. The third step sketches a further improvement by replacing the hard-coded equidistant 99-point spectrum with a flexibly-grading spectrum. In the fourth step we combine the flexibly-grading EEG spectrum, the spatial locations of the EEG electrodes, and the EEG recording time to train an intelligent EEG software sensor using self-organizing feature mapping. Our work contributes to NeuroIS research by analyzing EEG as a bio-signal though a novel machine-learning approach.

Flanker tasks, which require responding to stimuli surrounded by distracters that trigger incompatible action tendencies, are frequently used to measure this conflict. Even though the interference generated in these situations has been broadly studied, multivariate analysis techniques can shed new light into the underlying neural mechanisms. The current study is an initial approximation to adapt an interference Flanker paradigm embedded in a Demand-Selection Task (DST) to a format that allows measuring concurrent high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode conflict-related electrophysiological markers associated with congruent or incongruent target events in a time-frequency resolved way. Our results replicate findings obtained with other analysis approaches and offer new information regarding the dynamics of the underlying mechanisms, which show signs of reinstantiation. Our findings, some of which could not have been obtained with classic analytical strategies, open novel avenues of research.	[Lopez-Garcia, David; Sobrado, Alberto; Penalver, Jose M.

Deep learning methods have been introduced to functional network classification only very recently for fMRI, and the proposed architectures essentially focused on a single type of connectivity measure. Methods: We propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived brain connectome in schizophrenia (SZ). To capture complementary aspects of disrupted connectivity in SZ, we explore combination of various connectivity features consisting of time and frequency-domain metrics of effective connectivity based on vector autoregressive model and partial directed coherence, and complex network measures of network topology. We design a novel multi-domain connectome CNN (MDC-CNN) based on a parallel ensemble of 1D and 2D CNNs to integrate the features from various domains and dimensions using different fusion strategies. We also consider an extension to dynamic brain connectivity using the recurrent neural networks. Results: Hierarchical latent representations learned by the multiple convolutional layers from EEG connectivity reveals apparent group differences between SZ and healthy controls (HC). Results on a large resting-state EEG dataset show that the proposed CNNs significantly outperform traditional support vector machine classifier. The MDC-CNN with combined connectivity features further improves performance over single-domain CNNs using individual features, achieving remarkable accuracy of 91.69% with a decision-level fusion. Conclusion: The proposed MDC-CNN by integrating information from diverse brain connectivity descriptors is able to accurately discriminate SZ from HC. Significance: The new framework is potentially useful for developing diagnostic tools for SZ and other disorders.

Classification and analysis of the input imagery requires prior training and assisted error detection to improve the accuracy. In this article, pre-trained Gaussian mixture model (PGMM) is introduced for improving the accuracy of EEG signal imagery analysis. The proposed model relies on deep learning classifiers for analyzing the imagery using pixel based segmentation through pre-training models. The errors in classification are identified through recurrent convolution neural network training process as aided by the extracted features. Based on the pre-trained feature assessment, the false positive errors are mitigated to achieve a better accuracy (92%) under controlled classification time and high true positives.

However, an ear-EEG has a natural constraint of electrode location (e.g., limited in or around the ear) for acquiring informative brain signals sufficiently. Achieving reliable performance of ear-EEG in specific BCI paradigms that do not utilize brain signals on the temporal lobe around the ear is difficult. For example, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), which are mainly generated in the occipital area, have a significantly attenuated and distorted amplitude in ear-EEG. Therefore, preserving the high level of decoding accuracy is challenging and essential for SSVEP BCI based on ear-EEG. In this paper, we first investigate linear and nonlinear regression methods to increase the decoding accuracy of ear-EEG regarding SSVEP paradigm by utilizing the estimated target EEG signals on the occipital area. Then, we investigate an ensemble method to consider the prediction variability of the regression methods. Finally, we propose an error correction regression (ECR) framework to reduce the prediction errors by adding an additional nonlinear regression process (i.e., kernel ridge regression). We evaluate the ECR framework in terms of single session, session-to-session transfer, and subject-transfer decoding. We also validate the online decoding ability of the proposed framework with a short-time window size. The average accuracies are observed to be 91.11 +/- 9.14%, 90.52 +/- 8.67%, 86.96 +/- 12.13%, and 78.79 +/- 12.59%. This paper demonstrates that SSVEP BCI based on ear-EEG can achieve reliable performance with the proposed ECR framework.

This paper proposes a robust automatic seizure detection method that can establish a veritable diagnosis of these diseases. The proposed method consists of three steps: (i) remove artifact from EEG data using Savitzky-Golay filter and multi-scale principal component analysis (MSPCA), (ii) extract features from EEG signals using signal decomposition representations based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) allowing to overcome the non-linearity and non-stationary of EEG signals, and (iii) allocate the feature vector to the relevant class (i.e., seizure class "ictal" or free seizure class "interictal") using machine learning techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The experimental results were based on two EEG datasets generated from the CHB-MIT database with and without overlapping process. The results obtained have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method that allows achieving a higher classification accuracy rate up to 100% and also outperforms similar state-of-the-art methods.

However, individual differences of neurophysiological responses from BCI subjects constitute a stumbling block in individual-independent emotion recognition. In this study, we propose a new locally-robust feature selection (LRFS) method to determine generalizable features of electroencephalography (EEG) within several subsets of accessible subjects. In the LRFS framework, extracted EEG features are first modeled with probability densities. By evaluating the similarity of all density functions between each two subjects, inter-individual consistency of the EEG features is described. The derived consistency determines locally-robust EEG features, wherein importance of each feature is examined according to margin loss between emotions. To fuse selected features from multiple subsets of subjects, we employ ensemble learning principle and build an emotion classifier committee. Based on public DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI databases, individual-independent classification accuracy of the LRFS-based classifier is achieved by 0.65-0.68 (DEAP) and 0.67-0.70 (MAHNOB-HCI) for arousal and valence domains, respectively. Competitiveness of the LRFS has been validated when compared with several existing feature selection methods and emotion recognition systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One application of this technology consists of identifying the target speaker in a cocktail party-like scenario and activate speech enhancement algorithms in cochlear implants (CIs). It has been shown that in CIs it is possible to decode selective attention, although the worse spectral resolution and the electrical artifacts introduced by a CI decrease the accuracy of linear decoders in comparison to NH subjects. The goal of this work was to investigate the use of non-linear models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) to improve the selective attention decoding accuracy in CI users. The hypothesis is that a non-linear decoder may be able to better separate the electrical artifact from the neural responses. Results confirm the feasibility to decode selective attention by means of single-trial EEG data in NH and CI users using a high-density EEG. Moreover, we show that a simple DNN architecture that directly classifies the locus of attention based on the EEG and a mixture of the incoming speech stream envelopes can be used to decode selective attention in CI users.

As EEG practice expands, these experts are becoming increasingly limited resources. A highly sensitive and specific automated seizure detection system would streamline practice and expedite appropriate management for patients with possible nonconvulsive seizures. We aimed to test the performance of a recently FDA-cleared machine learning method (Clarit gamma, Ceribell Inc.) that measures the burden of seizure activity in real time and generates bedside alerts for possible status epilepticus (SE). Methods We retrospectively identified adult patients (n = 353) who underwent evaluation of possible seizures with Rapid Response EEG system (Rapid-EEG, Ceribell Inc.). Automated detection of seizure activity and seizure burden throughout a recording (calculated as the percentage of ten-second epochs with seizure activity in any 5-min EEG segment) was performed with Clarit gamma, and various thresholds of seizure burden were tested (>= 10% indicating >= 30 s of seizure activity in the last 5 min, >= 50% indicating >= 2.5 min of seizure activity, and >= 90% indicating >= 4.5 min of seizure activity and triggering a SE alert). The sensitivity and specificity of Clarit gamma's real-time seizure burden measurements and SE alerts were compared to the majority consensus of at least two expert neurologists. Results Majority consensus of neurologists labeled the 353 EEGs as normal or slow activity (n = 249), highly epileptiform patterns (HEP,n = 87), or seizures [n = 17, nine longer than 5 min (e.g., SE), and eight shorter than 5 min]. The algorithm generated a SE alert (>= 90% seizure burden) with 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of various thresholds for seizure burden during EEG recordings for detecting patients with seizures were 100% and 82% for >= 50% seizure burden and 88% and 60% for >= 10% seizure burden. Of the 179 EEG recordings in which the algorithm detected no seizures, seizures were identified by the expert reviewers in only two cases, indicating a negative predictive value of 99%. Discussion Clarit gamma detected SE events with high sensitivity and specificity, and it demonstrated a high negative predictive value for distinguishing nonepileptiform activity from seizure and highly epileptiform activity. Conclusions Ruling out seizures accurately in a large proportion of cases can help prevent unnecessary or aggressive over-treatment in critical care settings, where empiric treatment with antiseizure medications is currently prevalent. Clarit gamma's high sensitivity for SE and high negative predictive value for cases without epileptiform activity make it a useful tool for triaging treatment and the need for urgent neurological consultation.

However, it is error-prone to detect epileptic seizures by manually observing EEG, and labeling epilepsy data is an expensive and time-consuming process. In this study, without requiring any epileptic EEG data and only based on normal EEGs, a new self-supervised learning method is proposed for anomaly detection on EEG signals. In particular, a series of scaling transformations are performed on the original EEG data to generated self-labeled scaled EEG data, where different labels correspond to different scaling transformations. Then using the self-labeled normal EEG dataset, a multi-class classifier can be trained to accurately predict the scaling transformations on new normal EEG data, but not accurately on abnormal (epileptic) EEGs. The inconsistency between the predicted scaling transformations and the ground-truth scaling transformations can then be used to measure the degree of abnormality in a new EEG data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised method outperforms classic anomaly detection methods including one-class support vector machine (SVM) and autoencoders. The robustness of the proposed method also has been empirically proved with different classifier structures and by varying relevant hyper-parameters.

Previously, the traditional machine learning (ML)-based classifier are used to identify the seizure by extracting features from the EEG signals manually. Although the effectiveness of these contributions have already been proved, they cannot achieve multiple class classification with automatic feature extraction. Meanwhile, the identifiable EEG segment is too long to limit the capability of real-time epileptic seizure detection. In this paper, a novel deep convolutional long short-term memory (C-LSTM) model is proposed for detecting seizure and tumor in human brain and identifying two eyes statuses (open and close). It achieves to predict a result in every 0.006 seconds with a short detection duration (one second). By comparing with other two types deep learning approaches (DCNN and LSTM), the presented deep C-LSTM obtains the best performance for classifying these five classes.

Several shopfloor management (SM) systems can aid this conversion. They form two major factions. The first includes methodologies such as Balanced Scorecard (BSC). A defining feature is rigid structures to fixate on pre-defined goals. Other SM strategies instead concentrate on continuous improvement by giving directions. An example of this group is the "HOSHIN KANRI TREE" (HKT). One way of analyzing the dissimilarities, the advantages and disadvantages of these groups, is to examine the neurological patterns of workers as they are applying these. This paper aims to achieve this evaluation through non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, which capture the electrical activity of the brain. A deep learning (DL) soft sensor is used to classify the recorded data with an accuracy of 96.5%. Through this result and an analysis using the correlations of the EEG signals, it has been possible to detect relevant characteristics and differences in the brain's activity. In conclusion, these findings are expected to help assess SM systems and give guidance to Industry 4.0 leaders.

This systematic review aims to determine how previous studies have taken into consideration the important modeling issues for quantitative EEG (qEEG) predictors in developing prognostic models. A systematic search in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was performed to identify all predictive models for the extended Glasgow outcome scale (GOSE) and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) based on EEG data. Fourteen studies were identified that evaluated ML algorithms using qEEG predictors to predict outcome in patients with moderate to severe TBI. In each model, a maximum of five qEEG predictors were selected to determine the association between these parameters, and favorable or unfavorable predicted outcomes. The most common ML technique used was logistic regression, but the algorithms varied depending on the types and numbers of qEEG predictors selected in each model. The qEEG variability for the relative and absolute band powers were the most common qEEG predictors included in the models (46%) followed by total EEG power of all frequency bands (31%), EEG-reactivity (31%) and coherence (15%). Model performance was often quantified by the area under the receiving-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) rather than by accuracy rate. Various ML models have demonstrated great potential, especially using qEEG predictors, to predict outcome in patients with moderate to severe TBI.

Methods A total of 333 participants with methamphetamine (METH) dependence and 332 healthy control subjects were recruited between January 2018 and January 2019. EEG (five electrodes) and GSR signals were collected under four VR environments: one neutral scenario and three METH-simulated scenarios. Three ML classification techniques were evaluated: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). Results The MANOVA showed no interaction effects among the two subject groups and the 4 VR scenarios. Taking patient groups as the main effect, the METH user group had significantly lower GSR, lower EEG power in delta (p < .001), and alpha bands (p < .001) than healthy subjects. The EEG power of beta band (p < .001) and gamma band (p < .001) was significantly higher in METH group than the control group. Taking the VR scenarios (NeutralversusMETH-VR) as the main effects, the GSR, EEG power in delta, theta, and alpha bands in neutral scenario were significantly higher than in the METH-VR scenario (p < .001). The LR algorithm showed the highest specificity and sensitivity in distinguishing methamphetamine-dependent patients from healthy controls. Conclusion The study shows the potential of using machine learning to distinguish methamphetamine-dependent patients from healthy subjects by using EEG and GSR data. The LR algorithm shows the best performance comparing with SVM and RF algorithm.

Recent research has proved that human brain activity can be decoded from neurological data. Meanwhile, deep learning has become an effective way to solve practical problems. Taking advantage of these trends, in this paper, we propose a novel method of decoding brain activity evoked by visual stimuli. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a combined long short-term memory-convolutional neural network (LSTM-CNN) architecture to extract the compact category-dependent representations of electroencephalograms (EEG). Our approach combines the ability of LSTM to extract sequential features and the capability of CNN to distil local features. Next, we employ an improved spectral normalization generative adversarial network (SNGAN) to conditionally generate images using the learned EEG features. We evaluate our approach in terms of the classification accuracy of EEG and the quality of the generated images. The results show that the proposed LSTM-CNN algorithm that discriminates the object classes by using EEG can be more accurate than the existing methods. In qualitative and quantitative tests, the improved SNGAN performs better in the task of generating conditional images from the learned EEG representations; the produced images are realistic and highly resemble the original images. Our method can reconstruct the content of visual stimuli according to the brain's response. Therefore, it helps to decode the human brain activity by using an image-EEG-image transformation.

Event Related Desynchronization (ERD)/Event Related Synchronization (ERS) plays a significant role in finding discriminant features of MI EEG signals. ERD/ERS is one type and Evoked Potential (EP) is another type of brain response. This study focuses upon the classification of MI EEG signals by Removing Evoked Potential (REP) from non-discriminant MI EEG data in filter band selection, called REP. This optimization is done to enhance the classification performance. A comprehensive comparison of several pipelines is presented by using famous feature extraction methods, namely Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), XDawn. The effectiveness of REP is demonstrated on the PhysioNet dataset which is an online data resource. Comparison is done between the performance of pipelines including proposed one (Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC)) as well as before and after applying REP. It is observed that the REP approach has improved the classification accuracy of all the subjects used as well as all the pipelines, including state of the art algorithms, up to 20%.

The pathological progression of AD leads to cortical disconnection. These disconnections may manifest as functional connectivity alterations, measured by the degree of synchronization between different brain regions, and alterations in complex behaviors produced by the interaction among wide-spread brain regions. Recently, machine learning methods, such as clustering algorithms and classification methods, have been adopted to detect disease-related changes in functional connectivity and classify the features of these changes. Although complexity of EEG signals can also reflect AD-related changes, few machine learning studies have focused on the changes in complexity. Therefore, in this study, we compared the ability of EEG signals to detect characteristics of AD using different machine learning approaches one focused on functional connectivity and the other focused on signal complexity. We examined functional connectivity, estimated by phase lag index (PLI) in EEG signals in healthy older participants [healthy control (HC)] and patients with AD. We estimated signal complexity using multi-scale entropy. Utilizing a support vector machine, we compared the identification accuracy of AD based on functional connectivity at each frequency band and complexity component. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between synchronization and complexity. The identification accuracy of functional connectivity of the alpha, beta, and gamma bands was significantly high (AUC 1.0), and the identification accuracy of complexity was sufficiently high (AUC 0.81). Moreover, the relationship between functional connectivity and complexity exhibited various temporal-scale-and-regional-specific dependency in both HC participants and patients with AD. In conclusion, the combination of functional connectivity and complexity might reflect complex pathological process of AD. Applying a combination of both machine learning methods to neurophysiological data may provide a novel understanding of the neural network processes in both healthy brains and pathological conditions.

Therefore, accurate decoding of electroencephalography- (EEG-) based motion imagination has received a lot of attention, especially in the research of rehabilitation training. We propose a novel multifrequency brain network-based deep learning framework for motor imagery decoding. Firstly, a multifrequency brain network is constructed from the multichannel MI-related EEG signals, and each layer corresponds to a specific brain frequency band. The structure of the multifrequency brain network matches the activity profile of the brain properly, which combines the information of channel and multifrequency. The filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm filters the MI-based EEG signals in the spatial domain to extract features. Further, a multilayer convolutional network model is designed to distinguish different MI tasks accurately, which allows extracting and exploiting the topology in the multifrequency brain network. We use the public BCI competition IV dataset 2a and the public BCI competition III dataset IIIa to evaluate our framework and get state-of-the-art results in the first dataset, i.e., the average accuracy is 83.83% and the value of kappa is 0.784 for the BCI competition IV dataset 2a, and the accuracy is 89.45% and the value of kappa is 0.859 for the BCI competition III dataset IIIa. All these results demonstrate that our framework can classify different MI tasks from multichannel EEG signals effectively and show great potential in the study of remodelling the neural system of stroke patients.

In this review, we analyzed studies that used machine learning (ML) techniques to diagnose PD through resting state or motor activation electroencephalography (EEG) tests. Methods: The review process was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All publications previous to May 2020 were included, and their main characteristics and results were assessed and documented. Results: Nine studies were included. Seven used resting state EEG and two motor activation EEG. Subsymbolic models were used in 83.3% of studies. The accuracy for PD classification was 62-99.62%. There was no standard cleaning protocol for the EEG and a great heterogeneity in the characteristics that were extracted from the EEG. However, spectral characteristics predominated. Conclusions: Both the features introduced into the model and its architecture were essential for a good performance in predicting the classification. On the contrary, the cleaning protocol of the EEG, is highly heterogeneous among the different studies and did not influence the results. The use of ML techniques in EEG for neurodegenerative disorders classification is a recent and growing field.

In the use of conventional machine learning algorithms, feature selection is a fundamental difficulty given the large number of possible features and the small amount of available data. In this study, we bypass the challenges of feature selection and investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying workload memory tasks. CNNs are well suited for learning from the raw data without any a priori feature selection. CNNs take as input two-dimensional images, which differ in structure from the neural time series obtained on the scalp surface using EEG and fNIRS. Therefore, both the existing CNN architectures and fNIRS-EEG input must be adapted to allow fNIRS-EEG input to a CNN. In this work, we describe this adaptation, evaluate the performance of CNN classification of mental workload tasks. This study makes use of an open-source meta-dataset collected at the Technische Universitat Berlin; including simultaneous EEG and fNIRS recordings of 26 healthy participants during n-back tests. A CNN with three convolution layers and two fully connected layers is adapted to suit the given dataset. ReLU and ELU activation functions are employed to take advantage of their better dampening property in the vanishing gradient problem, fast convergence, and higher accuracy. The results achieved with the two activation functions are compared to select the best performing function. The proposed CNN approach achieves a considerable average improvement relative to conventional methods such as Support Vector Machines. The results across differences in time window length, activation functions, and other hyperparameters are benchmarked for each task. The best result is obtained with a three-second window and the ELU activation function, for which the CNN yields 89% correct classification, while the SVM achieves only 82% correct classification.

The generation of such signals is sometimes independent of the nervous system, such as in Passive BCI. This is majorly beneficial for those who have severe motor disabilities. Traditional BCI systems have been dependent only on brain signals recorded using Electroencephalography (EEG) and have used a rule-based translation algorithm to generate control commands. However, the recent use of multi-sensor data fusion and machine learning-based translation algorithms has improved the accuracy of such systems. This paper discusses various BCI applications such as tele-presence, grasping of objects, navigation, etc. that use multi-sensor fusion and machine learning to control a humanoid robot to perform a desired task. The paper also includes a review of the methods and system design used in the discussed applications.

There are several seizure onset patterns reported in the literature, and these patterns have clinical significance. In this work, we propose a system to automatically classify five seizure onset patterns from intracerebral EEG signals. Methods: The EEG was segmented by clinicians indicating the start and end time of each seizure onset pattern, the channels involved at onset and the seizure onset pattern. Twelve features that represent the time domain characteristics and signal complexity were extracted from 663 seizures channels of 24 patients. The features were used for classification of the patterns with support vector machine - Error-Correcting Output Codes (SVM-ECOC). Three patient groups with a similar number of seizure segments were created, and one group was used for testing and the rest for training. This test was repeated by rotating the testing and training data. Results: The feature space formed by both time domain and multiscale sample entropy features perform well in classification of the data. An overall accuracy of 80.7% was obtained with these features and a linear kernel of SVM-ECOC. Conclusions: The seizure onset patterns consist of varied time and complexity characteristics. It is possible to automatically classify various seizure onset patterns very similarly to visual classification. Significance: The proposed system could aid the medical team in assessing intracerebral EEG by providing an objective classification of seizure onset patterns.

Without considering any artifact removal approach, the residual neural network (ResNet) architecture is used to automatically learn the distinctive features of different sleep stages from the power spectral density (PSD) of the raw EEG data. The residual block of the ResNet learns the intrinsic features of different sleep stages from the EEG data while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. The proposed approach is validated using the sleep dataset of the Dreams database, which comprises of EEG signals for 20 healthy human subjects, 16 female and 4 male. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ResNet based approach in identifying different sleep stages in both female and male subjects compared to state-of-the-art methods with classification accuracies of 87.8% and 83.7%, respectively.

This abnormality appears as a seizure, the detection of which is an important research topic. An important tool used to study brain activity features, neurological disorders and particularly epileptic seizures, is known as electroencephalography (EEG). The visual inspection of epileptic abnormalities in EEG signals by neurologists is time-consuming. Different scientific approaches have been used to accurately detect epileptic seizures from EEG signals, and most of those approaches have obtained good performance. In this study, deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was considered to increase the performance of the identification system of epileptic seizures. We applied a cross-validation technique in the design phase of the system. For efficiency, comparative results between other machine-learning approaches and deep CNNs have been obtained. The experiments were performed using standard datasets. The results obtained indicate the efficiency of using CNN in the detection of epilepsy.

Traditionally, the most general mechanism of personal authentication was using alphanumeric passwords. However, passwords that are hard to guess or to break, are often hard to remember. There are demands for a technology capable of replacing the text-based password system. Graphical passwords can be an alternative, but it is vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks. This paper looks through a number of recently developed graphical password systems and introduces a personal authentication system using a machine learning technique with electroencephalography (EEG) signals as a new type of personal authentication system which is easier for a person to use and more difficult for others to steal than other preexisting authentication systems.

Although e-learning is convenient because it removes temporal and spatial limitations, it is difficult to know whether the learner is really paying attention to the learning materials. To address this problem, we tried to use electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate a learner's concentration in our previous study. However, our previous study relied on subjective evaluation, and there was no objective observation to relate the EEG signals to the learner's concentration. Given this background, we compared eye gaze and EEG results to find the appropriate position and frequency band of EEG in e-learning in this study. We compared the EEG result obtained during a period when the subjects were watching a video lecture and that obtained during a period when the subjects were not watching, and determined that the viewing state could be predicted from EEG logistic regression and a support vector machine (SVM). The results suggested that measuring beta and gamma waves and examining the parietal and occipital regions are both effective.

VMD is applied to decompose the EEG signal into Band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs). The five efficacious instantaneous features are computed using HT to construct the feature vector. Proposed EMRVFLN classifier is used to classify the epileptic seizure. The performances of the proposed EMRVFLN are compared with recently developed classifiers such as least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM). The combination of VMD and HT with proposed EMRVFLN classifier outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with classification accuracy of 100% for two class classification problem and 99.74% for three class classification problem. The remarkable classification accuracy facilitates the digital implementation of the proposed EMRVFLN classifier which may aid to design an embedded system for real-time disease diagnosis.

The traditional machine learning approaches use well-designed classifiers with hand-crafted features which may be limited to domain knowledge. Motivated by the outstanding performance of deep learning approaches in recognition tasks, we proposed a 3D convolutional neural network model to extract the spatial-temporal features automatically in the EEG signals. By the preprocessing method with baseline signals and the electrode topological structure relocated, the proposed model achieves a high accuracy rate of 96.61%, 96.43% in the Two class classification task (low/high arousal, low/high valence) and 93.53% in the Four class classification task (low arousal and low valence/high arousal and low valence/low arousal and high valence/high arousal and high valence) in the DEAP dataset, and 97.52%, 96.96% in the Two class classification task and 95.86% in the Four class classification task in the AMIGOS dataset.

Therefore, emotions affect people's lives and decision-making mechanisms throughout their lives. However, the fact that emotions vary from person to person, being an abstract concept and being dependent on internal and external factors makes the studies in this field difficult. In recent years, studies based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which perform emotion analysis in a more robust and reliable way, have gained momentum. In this article, emotion analysis based on EEG signals was performed to predict positive and negative emotions. The study consists of four parts. In the first part, EEG signals were obtained from the GAMEEMO data set. In the second stage, the spectral entropy values of the EEG signals of all channels were calculated and these values were classified by the bidirectional long-short term memory architecture in the third stage. In the last stage, the performance of the deep-learning architecture was evaluated with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. With the proposed method, an accuracy of 76.91% and a ROC value of 90% were obtained.	[Alakus, T.

For the analysis of brain dynamics, non-stationary motor imagery signals are used. Although a number of studies have been carried out for the extraction of hidden patterns and classification of EEG signals, temporal information has rarely been incorporated. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal energy maps generation scheme followed by deep learning classification model. Common spatial pattern filters and Fast Fourier Transform Energy Maps are deployed to obtain discriminative and spatio-temporal features. Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) based neural network has been proposed to classify the temporal series of energy maps. This research also investigates preprocessing techniques to obtain optimal parameters which include frequency bands selection and temporal segmentation. The proposed model is evaluated on BCI Competition IV dataset 2a and achieved 0:64 mean kappa for multi-class EEG classification, which is the current state of the art. Furthermore, several empirical findings are also presented, that may be of significant interest to the BCI community.

J	Phang, CR; Ko, LW				Phang, Chun-Ren; Ko, Li-Wei			Global Cortical Network Distinguishes Motor Imagination of the Left and Right Foot	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; brain connectivity networks; machine learning; EEG; foot motor imagery	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PARIETAL CORTEX; BCI SYSTEM; IMAGERY; EEG; EXECUTION; REHABILITATION; CLASSIFICATION; EXOSKELETON; MUSIC	Conventional passive lower limb rehabilitation is suboptimal since the brain is not actively involved in the training. An autonomous motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) could potentially improve rehabilitation outcomes. However, motor cortex regions associated with the individual feet are anatomically close to each other. This presents a difficulty in distinguishing the left and right foot MI during rehabilitation therapy. To overcome this difficulty, we extracted functional connectivity to measure the global cortical network via electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Fourteen spatial connections (P3-Fp1, P3-F3, P3-F7, P3-C3, T5-F7, T5-C3, T5-T3, Fp2-T5, Fp2-P3, T6-Fp2, T6-T4, Cz-Fp1, Cz-F7 and Fp2-F7) found across twelve subjects significantly differed between the left and right foot MI, evidencing nonlocalized brain activity during MI. Foot MI were distinguished using machine learning algorithms in terms of the time- and frequency-domain connectivities extracted from Pearson's correlation, multivariate autoregression (MVAR), bandpass correlation, and partial directed coherence (PDC) models. The results showed that connectivity extracted by pairwise Pearson's correlation could be distinguished with 86.26 +/- 9.95%, while in the frequency-domain, the gamma band presented the best classification accuracy of 73.55 +/- 17.11%. We attempted to simulate asynchronous real-time classification paradigms in order to evaluate the classification performance of connectivity features compared to common spatial pattern (CSP) and band power (BP). The results indicate correlation-connectivity has the best outcome, attaining an accuracy of 80.75 +/- 9.51% in asynchronous classification.

Methods for single-trial and multi-trial EEG classification are both investigated in this study. Attention mechanisms and a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are incorporated as the decoding model. Attention mechanisms emphasize task-related responses and reduce redundant information of EEG, whereas RNN learns feature representations for classification from the processed EEG data. To promote generalization of the decoding model, a novel online data augmentation method that randomly averages EEG sequences to generate artificial signals is proposed for single-trial EEG. For our dataset, the data augmentation method improves the accuracy of our model (based on RNN) and two benchmark models (based on convolutional neural networks) by 5.60%, 3.92%, and 3.02%, respectively. The attention-based RNN reaches mean accuracies of 67.18% for single-trial EEG decoding with data augmentation. When performing multi-trial EEG classification, the amount of training data decreases linearly after averaging, which may result in poor generalization. To address this deficiency, we devised three schemes to randomly combine data for network training. Accordingly, the results indicate that the proposed strategies effectively prevent overfitting and improve the correct classification rate compared with averaging EEG fixedly (by up to 19.20%). The highest accuracy of the three strategies for multi-trial EEG classification achieves 82.92%. The decoding performance for the methods proposed in this work indicates they have application potential in the brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on visual motion perception.

The feature extraction of motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) is to find the most effective characteristics of complex EEG signal that can represent the consciousness task, to differentiate the feature vectors extracted from different consciousness tasks, and to maximize the correlation between the feature vector and the consciousness task. On the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous research works, this paper proposes a new EEG feature extraction algorithm based on common spatial pattern (CSP) and adaptive auto-regressive (AAR), and demonstrates feasibility of band energy, sample entropy and order accumulation to be the characteristics of motor imagery classification, and finally compares the classification effects of linear discrimination classifier, common space classifier and Bayesian classifier.

J	Fu, RR; Wang, H; Bao, TT; Han, MM				Fu, Rongrong; Wang, Han; Bao, Tiantian; Han, Mengmeng			EEG intentions recognition in dynamic complex object control task by functional brain networks and regularized discriminant analysis	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Dynamic complex model; EEG; Regularized discriminant analysis; Functional brain network	INVERSE GAUSSIAN PARAMETERS; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION; SLEEP STAGES; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION	Most of the tasks involved in neurological rehabilitation are generally constrained. However the complexity of experimental paradigms with constraints for acquiring electroencephalography (EEG) are relatively low. In order to improve the level of arousal in the brain, we propose an energy-constrained dynamic and complex experimental paradigm. In this novel experimental paradigm, EEG signals collected under the novel paradigm have different motor intentions. In this study, we combine the phase synchronization method and common spatial pattern (CSP) to build functional brain networks of subjects. Based on this method, we investigate the correlation of the global and local features of the functional brain networks and use regularized discriminant analysis (RDA) to recognize features. The accuracy obtained by the proposed method for EEG intention recognition can reach 93.47% (p < 0.01). The results show that the proposed method can decode EEG intention with high recognition performance during the manipulation of complex objects, which lays a foundation for the study of neurological rehabilitation.

Currently, chronic stress is mainly determined using questionnaires, which are, however, subjective in nature. While chronic stress has negative influences on health, it also greatly influences decision-making processes in humans. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning approach based on the fine-graded spectral analysis of resting-state EEG recordings, to diagnose chronic stress. By using this new machine learning approach, we achieve a very good balanced accuracy of 81.33%, outperforming the current benchmark by 10%. Our algorithm allows an objective assessment of chronic stress, is accurate, robust, fast and cost-efficient and substantially contributes to decision-making research, as well as Information Systems research in healthcare.

J	Luo, J; Gao, X; Zhu, XB; Wang, B; Lu, N; Wang, J				Luo, Jing; Gao, Xing; Zhu, Xiaobei; Wang, Bin; Lu, Na; Wang, Jie			Motor imagery EEG classification based on ensemble support vector learning	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Motor imagery; Common spatial pattern; Support vector machine	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; CSP	Background and Objective: Brain-computer interfaces build a communication pathway from the human brain to a computer. Motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (EEG) classification is a widely applied paradigm in brain-computer interfaces. The common spatial pattern, based on the event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) phenomenon, is one of the most popular algorithms for motor imagery-based EEG classification. Moreover, the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature based on the event-related potential phenomenon has been demonstrated to provide complementary information to ERD/ERS-based features. In this paper, aiming to improve the performance of motor imagery-based EEG classification in a few-channel situation, an ensemble support vector learning (ESVL)-based approach is proposed to combine the advantages of the ERD/ERS-based features and the event-related potential-based features in motor imagery-based EEG classification. Methods: ESVL is an ensemble learning algorithm based on support vector machine classifier. Specifically, the decision boundary with the largest interclass margin is obtained using the support vector machine algorithm, and the distances between sample points and the decision boundary are mapped to posterior probabilities. The probabilities obtained from different support vector machine classifiers are combined to make prediction. Thus, ESVL leverages the advantages of multiple trained support vector machine classifiers and makes a better prediction based on the posterior probabilities. The class discrepancy-guided sub-band-based common spatial pattern and the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature are applied to extract discriminative features, and then, the extracted features are used to train the ESVL classifier and make predictions. Results: The BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed ESVL algorithm. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods are performed, and the proposed ESVL-based approach achieves an average max kappa value of 0.60 and 0.71 on BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b respectively. The results show that the proposed ESVL-based approach improves the performance of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces. Conclusion: The proposed ESVL classifier could use the posterior probabilities to realize ensemble learning and the ESVL-based motor imagery classification approach takes advantage of the merits of ERD/ERS based feature and event-related potential based feature to improve the experimental performance.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of electroencephalography (EEG) phenotypes according to the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's Critical Care EEG classification for predicting early recovery after CA. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU after CA were enrolled. We analyzed Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score within 10 days after CA and evaluated mortality within 28 days according to EEG pattern subtype. Results: Among the total of 71 patients, 9 had periodic discharges (PDs) EEG pattern, 4 had rhythmic delta activity (RDA), 8 had spike-and-wave (SW), 22 had low voltage, 5 had burst suppression, and 23 had other EEG patterns. Initial GCS scores, GCS scores 3 days after CA (or 3 days after targeted temperature management [TTM]), and 10 days after CA (or 10 days after TTM) were significantly different among EEG subtypes (p < 0.001, respectively) (Table 2). GCS scores were significantly higher in RDA and the other EEG group compared to the PDs, SW, low voltage, and burst suppression groups (p < 0.001). Significant group x time interactions were observed for the follow-up period between EEG phenotypes (p < 0.001) demonstrating the most increase in the other EEG pattern group. Conclusions: Consciousness states were significantly worse in the PDs, SW, burst suppression, and low-voltage groups compared to the RDA and the other EEG pattern within 10 days after CA. The degree of consciousness recovery differed significantly by EEG pattern subtype within 10 days.

In this study, we made progress toward user intention decoding and successfully classified six different reaching movements of the right arm in the movement execution (ME). Notably, we designed an experimental environment using robotic arm movement and proposed a convolutional neural network architecture (CNN) with inception block for robust classify executed movements of the same limb. As a result, we confirmed the classification accuracies of six different directions show 0.45 for the executed session. The results proved that the proposed architecture has approximately 6 similar to 13% performance increase compared to its conventional classification models. Hence, we demonstrate the 3D inception CNN architecture to contribute to the continuous decoding of ME.

The calcium imaging video data images the whole brain-wide neurons activities with electrical discharge recorded by calcium fluorescence intensity (CFI). In this paper, using the zebrafish's brain-wide calcium image video data, we propose a data-driven approach to effectively detect the systemic change-point, and further predict the epileptic seizures. Our approach includes two phases: offline training and online testing. Specifically, during offline training, we extract features and confirm the existence of systemic change-point, then estimate the ratio of unchanged system duration to interictal period duration. For online testing, we implement a statistical model to estimate the change-point, and then predict the onset of epileptic seizure. The testing results show that our proposed approach could effectively predict the time range of future epileptic seizure. Furthermore, we explore the macroscopic patterns of epileptic and control cases, and extract features based on the pattern difference, then implement and compare the classification performance from four machine learning models. Based on the data structure, we also propose a new method to discretize related features, and combine with hierarchical clustering to better visualize and explain the pattern difference between epileptic and control cases.

Epilepsy affects patients' health and lead to life-threatening situations. Early prediction of epilepsy is highly effective to avoid seizures. Machine Learning algorithms have been used to classify epilepsy from Electroencephalograms (EEG) data. These algorithms exhibited reduced performance when classes are imbalanced. This work presents an integrated machine learning approach for epilepsy detection, which can effectively learn from imbalanced data. This approach utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) at the first stage to extract both high- and low-variant Principal Components (PCs), which are empirically customized for imbalanced data classification. Conventionally, PCA is used for dimension reduction of a dataset leveraging PCs with high variances. In this paper, we propose a model to show that PCs associated with low variances can capture the implicit pattern of minor class of a dataset. The selected PCs are then fed into different machine learning classifiers to predict seizures. We performed experiments on the Epileptic Seizure Recognition dataset to evaluate our model. The experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed model.

Although data-driven machine learning (ML) approach has shown promise in MWL recognition, there is still difficulty in acquiring a sufficient number of labeled data to train the ML models. This paper proposes a semi-supervised extreme learning machine (SS-ELM) algorithm for MWL pattern classification requiring only a small number of labeled data. The measured data analysis results show that the proposed SS-ELM paradigm can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of MWL classification and thus provide a competitive ML approach to utilizing a large number of unlabeled data which are available in many real-world applications.

EEG signal with machine learning has gained substantial success in the BCI. However, the availability of limited training data, appropriate model selection and high false-positive rates are the challenges that need immediate attention. Therefore, in this Letter, the authors present a mental task classification model based on the notion of transfer learning that addresses the issue of data scarcity, model selection and misclassification ratio. In the framework, the proposed model uses pre-trained network for the extraction of diverse feature and classify using support vector machine. The authors employed four pre-trained networks to identify the optimal network for the proposed framework: Vgg16, Vgg19, Resnet18 and Resnet50. The highest classification accuracy of 86.85% (using Resnet50) was achieved using transfer learning. Comparison results showed that convolutional neural network-based approach outperformed conventional machine learning approaches and hence it can be concluded that the EEG-based classification of the mental task using transfer learning model could be used in developing a superior model despite the limited data availability.

Although data-driven machine learning (ML) approach has shown promise in MWL recognition, it is usually difficult to acquire sufficient labeled data to train the ML model. This paper proposes semi-supervised extreme learning machines (SS-ELM) for MWL pattern classification using solely a small number of labeled data. The experimental data analysis results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ELM paradigm to effectively exploit a large number of unlabeled data for the real-world 3- or 4-class MWL classification problem.

AD, which is the most common form of dementia, is a major public health problem worldwide. Efficient detection of MCI is essential to identify the risks of AD and dementia. Currently Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most popular tool to investigate the presenence of MCI biomarkers. This study aims to develop a new framework that can use EEG data to automatically distinguish MCI patients from healthy control subjects. The proposed framework consists of noise removal (baseline drift and power line interference noises), segmentation, data compression, feature extraction, classification, and performance evaluation. This study introduces Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) for compressing massive volumes of EEG data for reliable analysis. Permutation entropy (PE) and auto-regressive (AR) model features are investigated to explore whether the changes in EEG signals can effectively distinguish MCI from healthy control subjects. Finally, three models are developed based on three modern machine learning techniques: Extreme Learning Machine (ELM); Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) for the obtained feature sets. Our developed models are tested on a publicly available MCI EEG database and the robustness of our models is evaluated by using a 10-fold cross validation method. The results show that the proposed ELM based method achieves the highest classification accuracy (98.78%) with lower execution time (0.281 seconds) and also outperforms the existing methods. The experimental results suggest that our proposed framework could provide a robust biomarker for efficient detection of MCI patients.

However, clinicians sometimes delay the initiation of this drug because of its adverse side-effects. Therefore, identification of predictive biological markers of clozapine response are extremely valuable to aid on-time initiation of treatment. In this study, we develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm based on pre-treatment electroencephalogram (EEG) data sets to predict response to clozapine treatment in 57 TRS-SCZs, where the treatment outcome, after at least one-year follow-up is determined using the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). The ML algorithm has three steps: 1) a brain source localization (BSL) procedure using the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming approach is employed on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from 30 specified brain regions. 2) An effective connectivity measure named symbolic transfer entropy (STE) is applied to the source waveforms. 3) A ML algorithm is applied to the STE matrix to determine whether a set of features can be found to discriminate most-responder (MR) SCZ patients from least-responder (LR) ones. The findings of this study reveal that STE features can achieve an accuracy of 95.83%. This finding implies that analysis of pre-treatment EEG could contribute to our ability to distinguish MR from LR SCZs, and that the source STE matrix may prove to be a promising tool for the prediction of the clinical response to clozapine.

Predictive regression modeling with MEG/EEG: from source power to signals and cognitive states	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MEG/EEG; Neuronal oscillations; Machine learning; Covariance; Spatial filters; Riemannian geometry	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CROSS-VALIDATION; LINEAR-MODELS; EEG; MEG; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION	Predicting biomedical outcomes from Magnetoencephalography and Electroencephalography (M/EEG) is central to applications like decoding, brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) or biomarker development and is facilitated by supervised machine learning. Yet, most of the literature is concerned with classification of outcomes defined at the event-level. Here, we focus on predicting continuous outcomes from M/EEG signal defined at the subjectlevel, and analyze about 600 MEG recordings from Cam-CAN dataset and about 1000 EEG recordings from TUH dataset. Considering different generative mechanisms for M/EEG signals and the biomedical outcome, we propose statistically-consistent predictive models that avoid source-reconstruction based on the covariance as representation. Our mathematical analysis and ground-truth simulations demonstrated that consistent function approximation can be obtained with supervised spatial filtering or by embedding with Riemannian geometry. Additional simulations revealed that Riemannian methods were more robust to model violations, in particular geometric distortions induced by individual anatomy. To estimate the relative contribution of brain dynamics and anatomy to prediction performance, we propose a novel model inspection procedure based on biophysical forward modeling. Applied to prediction of outcomes at the subject-level, the analysis revealed that the Riemannian model better exploited anatomical information while sensitivity to brain dynamics was similar across methods. We then probed the robustness of the models across different data cleaning options. Environmental denoising was globally important but Riemannian models were strikingly robust and continued performing well even without preprocessing. Our results suggest each method has its niche: supervised spatial filtering is practical for eventlevel prediction while the Riemannian model may enable simple end-to-end learning.

One of the most important applications of ML in epilepsy is seizure detection and prediction, using wearable devices (WDs). However, not all currently available algorithms implemented in WDs are using ML. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of using WDs and ML in epilepsy, and we outline future development in these domains. There is published evidence for reliable detection of epileptic seizures using implanted electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes and wearable, non-EEG devices. Application of ML using the data recorded with WDs from a large number of patients could change radically the way we diagnose and manage patients with epilepsy.

The modern procedures adopted for this purpose are complex which limits their use in practical applications. In this study, for the first time, and to the best of our knowledge, a successive decomposition index (SDI)-based feature extraction approach is utilized for the classification of motor and mental imagery electroencephalography (EEG) tasks. First of all, the public datasets IVa, IVb, and V from BCI competition III were denoised using multiscale principal analysis (MSPCA), and then a SDI feature was calculated corresponding to each trial of the data. Finally, six benchmark machine learning and neural network classifiers were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. All the experiments were performed for motor and mental imagery datasets in binary and multiclass applications using a 10-fold cross-validation method. Furthermore, computerized automatic detection of motor and mental imagery using SDI (CADMMI-SDI) is developed to describe the proposed approach practically. The experimental results suggest that the highest classification accuracy of 97.46% (Dataset IVa), 99.52% (Dataset IVb), and 99.33% (Dataset V) was obtained using feedforward neural network classifier. Moreover, a series of experiments, namely, statistical analysis, channels variation, classifier parameters variation, processed and unprocessed data, and computational complexity, were performed and it was concluded that SDI is robust for noise, and a non-complex and efficient biomarker for the development of fast and accurate motor and mental imagery BCI systems.

In general, subjects wearing a single-channel EEG electrode located atF(8)(10-20 international standards) were required to perform mental tasks by mentally visualising the rotation of a star and mind relaxation at a specific time and by robot orientation. The visualisation of a rotating star suggests that the mobile robot is currently oriented towards a target, thus enabling target selection. We showed that proposed classifier obtained the best accuracy of 92.09% in classifying the subject's performing mental rotation task or mental relaxation when compared with conventional classification methods such as support vector machine-75.69%,Kth-nearest neighbour-65.50% and linear discriminant analysis-65.20%. Furthermore, different from conventional methods, the use of 1D-CNN enables end-to-end learning, that is the automatic decoding of EEG signals without requiring feature selection or extraction. To validate that the proposed classifier performs better than conventional methods, the extracted kernel weights of proposed 1D-CNN filters were visualised as a temporal plot, and spectral analysis was performed on the extracted weights. The obtained results confirmed that the proposed 1D-CNN was able to generate filters that resemble the EEG wave patterns of different frequencies and spectral analysis confirmed that the filters exploited information from multiple frequency bands (such as alpha band and beta band) that are often associated with a heightened mental state when performing mental tasks.

In this paper, we design an EEG channel optimization model, named Domain Adversarial Sparse Learning model (DASL), to perform fatigue state detection with minimal and optimal EEG electrodes. DASL composes of Sparse Learning (SL), Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Herein, SL is used to find the optimal EEG channels through selecting key features from the source domain, these key features are then used to determine fatigue state by DANN across subjects, GAN aims at improving the robustness for our proposed model. Experimental results show DASL outperforms other traditional machine learning methods in the classification performance of mental state tasks under the condition of optimal and minimal EEG electrodes.

The previous works have shown that low dimensional fast Fourier transform (FFT) features and many machine learning algorithms have been applied. In this paper, we demonstrate utilization of features extracted from EEG signals via FFT to improve the performance of automated sleep stage classification through machine learning methods. Unlike previous works using FFT, we incorporated thousands of FFT features in order to classify the sleep stages into 2-6 classes. Using the expanded version of Sleep-EDF dataset with 61 recordings, our method outperformed other state-of-the art methods. This result indicates that high dimensional FFT features in combination with a simple feature selection is effective for the improvement of automated sleep stage classification.

A novel approach for classification of mental tasks using multiview ensemble learning (MEL)	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Multiview learning; Brain computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalography (EEG); Mental tasks classification; Wavelet transform (WT); Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Fuzzy C-means; Feature coding; Support vector machine (SVM)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; DECOMPOSITION; CLASSIFIERS; MODE	Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a domain, in which a person can send information without using any exterior nerve or muscles, just using their brain signal, called electroencephalography (EEG) signal. Multiview learning or data integration or data fusion from a different set of features is an emerging way in machine learning to improve the generalized performance by considering the knowledge with multiple views. Multiview learning has made rapid progress and development in recent years and is also facing many new challenges. This method can be used in the BCI domain, as the meaningful representa-tion of the EEG signal in plenty of ways. This study utilized the multiview ensemble learning (MEL) approach for the binary classification of five mental tasks on the six subjects individually. In this study, we used a well-known EEG database (Keirn and Aunon database). The EEG signal has been decomposed using by methods i.e wavelet transform (WT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), empirical wavelet transform (EWT), and fuzzy C-means followed by EWT (FEWT). After that, the feature coding technique is applied using parametric feature formation from the decomposed signal. Hence, we had four views to learn four same type of independent base classifiers and predictions are made in an ensemble manner. The study is performed independently with three types of base classifiers, i.e., K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) with linear and non-linear kernels The performance validation of the ten combinations of mental tasks was performed by three MEL based classifiers, i.e., K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) with linear and non-linear kernels. For reliability of the obtained results of the classifiers, 10-fold cross-validation was used. The proposed algorithm shows a promising accuracy of 80% to 100% for binary pair-wise classification of mental tasks. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Gupta, A.; Singh, V.

The diagnosis of sleep apnea is possible by the detection of apnea events using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. This paper introduces an adaptive decomposition for the detection of apnea events using EEG signals. In introduced decomposition, the evolutionary techniques (ETs) optimized Hermite functions (HFs) represent the EEG signals. In tested ETs, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm provides the least reconstruction error for the representation of EEG signals. The ABC is considered for Hermite coefficients-based feature extraction. From the extracted features, a highly discriminative feature set is obtained using the Fisher-score ranking test. The apnea detection performance of ranking-based selected features is evaluated using the extreme learning machine and least-squares support vector machine classifiers. The proposed method obtained performance measures, sensitivity 99.47, specificity 99.58, and accuracy 99.53, are better as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

While current tests for EDS are time-consuming, expensive, and inaccurate, modern data-driven approaches can significantly improve diagnosis and treatment quality. Using an improved machine learning (ML) method in combination with the unfolding of electroencephalogram (EEG) bandwidths in a fine-graded equidistant 99-point spectrum, we successfully developed and evaluated a fast classification model to correctly diagnose EDS. Our model achieved a good level of accuracy of 87.00 percent on completely unseen resting-state EEG data. Our model is one of the first to detect long term EDS instead of short-term drowsiness from EEG data and significantly extends related work on the detection of drowsiness by considering the local occurrence of differences in spectral power.

In this paper, the classification of five complex functional upper limb movements is studied by using only the pre-movement planning and preparation recordings of EEG data. Methods: Nine healthy volunteers performed five different upper limb movements. Different frequency bands of the EEG signal are extracted by the stationary wavelet transform. Common spatial patterns are used as spatial filters to enhance separation of the five movements in each frequency band. In order to increase the efficiency of the system, a mutual information-based feature selection algorithm is applied. The selected features are classified using the k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and linear discriminant analysis methods. Results: K-nearest neighbor method outperformed the other classifiers and resulted in an average classification accuracy of 94.0 +/- 2.7% for five classes of movements across subjects. Further analysis of each frequency band's contribution in the optimal feature set, showed that the gamma and beta frequency bands had the most contribution in the classification. To reduce the complexity of the EEG recording system setup, we selected a subset of the 10 most effective EEG channels from 64 channels, by which we could reach an accuracy of 70%. Those EEG channels were mostly distributed over the prefrontal and frontal areas. Conclusions: Overall, the results indicate that it is possible to classify complex movements before the movement onset by using spatially selected EEG data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we conducted three computational decoding experiments that investigated decoding accuracy: (1) based on delta band time-domain features, (2) when downsampling data, (3) of different frequency band features. In each experiment, eight different decoder algorithms were compared including the current state-of-the-art. Different tap sizes (sample window sizes) were also evaluated for a real-time applicability assessment. A feature of importance analysis was conducted to ascertain which features were most relevant for decoding; moreover, the stability to perturbations was assessed to quantify the robustness of the methods. Results indicated that generally the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Quasi Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) outperformed other methods in terms of decoding accuracy and stability. Previous state-of-the-art Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) still outperformed other decoders when using smaller tap sizes, with fast convergence in performance, but occurred at a cost to noise vulnerability. Downsampling and the inclusion of other frequency band features yielded overall improvement in performance. The results suggest that neural network-based decoders with downsampling or a wide range of frequency band features could not only improve decoder performance but also robustness with applications for stable use of BCIs.

In order to have a high performing BCI classification, the training set must contain variations of high quality subjects which are discriminative. Variations will also drive transferability of training data for generalization purposes. However, if the test subject is unique from the training set variations, BCI performance may suffer. Previously, this problem was solved by introducing transfer learning in the context of spatial filtering on small training set by creating high quality variations within training subjects. In this study however, it was discovered that transfer learning can also be used to compress the training data into an optimal compact size while improving training data performance. The transfer learning framework proposed was on motor imagery BCI-EEG using CUR matrix decomposition algorithm which decomposes data into two components; C and UR which is each subject's EEG signal and common matrix derived from historical EEG data, respectively. The method is considered transfer learning process because it utilizes historical data as common matrix for the classification purposes. This framework is implemented in the BCI system along with Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as features extractor and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as classifier and this combination exhibits an increase of accuracy to up to 26% with 83% training database compression.

Advances in signal processing and machine learning have provided the research community with an opportunity to develop automated real-time identification techniques to detect the signs of hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy in larger electroencephalography/amplitude-integrated electroencephalography data sets more easily. This review details the recent achievements, performed by a number of prominent research groups across the world, in the automatic identification and classification of hypoxic-ischemic epileptiform neonatal seizures using advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques. This review also addresses the clinical challenges that current automated techniques face in order to be fully utilized by clinicians, and highlights the importance of upgrading the current clinical bedside sampling frequencies to higher sampling rates in order to provide better hypoxic-ischemic biomarker detection frameworks. Additionally, the article highlights that current clinical automated epileptiform detection strategies for human neonates have been only concerned with seizure detection after the therapeutic latent phase of injury. Whereas recent animal studies have demonstrated that the latent phase of opportunity is critically important for early diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic-encephalopathy electroencephalography biomarkers and although difficult, detection strategies could utilize biomarkers in the latent phase to also predict the onset of future seizures.

Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) have shown that it is possible to identify the target speaker from single-trial EEG recordings using auditory attention decoding (AAD) methods. AAD methods reconstruct the attended speech envelope from EEG recordings, based on a linear least-squares cost function or non-linear neural networks, and then directly compare the reconstructed envelope with the speech envelopes of speakers to identify the attended speaker using Pearson correlation coefficients. Since these correlation coefficients are highly fluctuating, for a reliable decoding a large correlation window is used, which causes a large processing delay. In this paper, we investigate a state-space model using correlation coefficients obtained with a small correlation window to improve the decoding performance of the linear and the non-linear AAD methods. The experimental results show that the state-space model significantly improves the decoding performance.

Electroencephalogram-Based Preference Prediction Using Deep Transfer Learning	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Brain modeling; Task analysis; Emotion recognition; Extraterrestrial measurements; Biological neural networks; Cognition; Data mining; brain-computer interfaces; emotion recognition; supervised learning; artificial neural networks; signal processing; consumer behavior	EEG; CLASSIFICATION; RESPONSES; ASYMMETRY; AROUSAL; BRAIN	Transfer learning is an approach in machine learning where a model that was built and trained on one task is re-purposed on a second task. The success of transfer learning in computer vision has motivated its use in neuroscience. Although common in image recognition, the use of transfer learning in EEG classification remains unexplored. Most EEG-based neuroscience studies depend on using traditional machine learning algorithms to answer a question, rather than on improving the algorithms. Developing algorithms for transfer learning for EEG can also assist with problems of low data availability in EEG classification. The primary objective of this study is to investigate EEG-based transfer learning and propose deep transfer learning models to transfer knowledge from emotion recognition to preference recognition to enhance the classification prediction accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the effect of applying deep transfer learning between EEG-based emotion recognition and EEG-based preference detection. We propose different approaches for deep transfer learning models to detect preferences from EEG signals using the preprocessed DEAP dataset. Two types of features were extracted from EEG signals, namely the power spectral density and valence. We built three models of deep neural networks: basic without transfer learning, fine-tuning of deep transfer learning, and retraining of deep transfer learning. We compared the performance of deep transfer learning with those of deep neural networks and other conventional classification algorithms such as support vector machine, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor. Although the deep neural network classifiers achieved a high accuracy of greater than 87%, deep transfer learning achieved the highest accuracy result of 93%. The results demonstrate that although the proposed deep transfer learning approaches exhibit higher accuracy than the support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor classifiers, random forest achieves results similar to those of deep transfer learning.

Our model captures the spatio-temporal spread of a seizure by assigning a sequence of latent states (i.e. baseline or seizure) to each EEG channel. The state evolution is coupled between neighboring and contralateral channels to mimic clinically observed spreading patterns. Since the latent state space is exponential, a structured variational algorithm is developed for approximate inference. The model is evaluated on simulated and clinical EEG from two different hospitals. One dataset contains seizure recordings of adult focal epilepsy patients at the Johns Hopkins Hospital; the other contains publicly available non-specified seizure recordings from pediatric patients at Boston Children's Hospital. Our CHMM model outperforms standard machine learning techniques in the focal dataset and achieves comparable performance to the best baseline method in the pediatric dataset. We also demonstrate the ability to track seizures, which is valuable information to localize focal onset zones.

The use of EEG as an objective measure for cost effective and personalized stress management becomes important in situations like the nonavailability of mental health facilities. In this study, long-term stress was classified with machine learning algorithms using resting state EEG signal recordings. The labeling for the stress and control groups was performed using two currently accepted clinical practices: (i) the perceived stress scale score and (ii) expert evaluation. The frequency domain features were extracted from five-channel EEG recordings in addition to the frontal and temporal alpha and beta asymmetries. The alpha asymmetry was computed from four channels and used as a feature. Feature selection was also performed to identify statistically significant features for both stress and control groups (via t-test). We found that support vector machine was best suited to classify long-term human stress when used with alpha asymmetry as a feature. It was observed that the expert evaluation-based labeling method had improved the classification accuracy by up to 85.20%. Based on these results, it is concluded that alpha asymmetry may be used as a potential bio-marker for stress classification, when labels are assigned using expert evaluation.

Epileptic seizure types not only impact the choice of drugs but also the range of activities a patient can safely engage in. With recent advances being made towards artificial intelligence enabled automatic seizure detection, the next frontier is the automatic classification of seizure types. On that note, in this paper, we explore the application of machine learning algorithms for multi-class seizure type classification. We used the recently released TUH EEG seizure corpus (v1.4.0 and v1.5.2) and conducted a thorough search space exploration to evaluate the performance of a combination of various preprocessing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and corresponding hyperparameters on this task. We show that our algorithms can reach a weighted F1 score of up to 0.901 for seizure-wise cross validation and 0.561 for patient-wise cross validation thereby setting a benchmark for scalp EEG based multi-class seizure type classification.

Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the yield and pattern of EEG abnormalities in patients with GE with the view to determining factors that are independently associated with abnormal EEG in them. Methods: We characterized EEG features and evaluated associated factors in a sample of people with GE in a Saudi population. Standard definition of interictal epileptiform discharges was used. Results: A total of 1105 (77%) out of 1436 GE patients had EEG. Five hundred and ninety-five (53.85%) patients had abnormal EEG. Factors associated with EEG abnormalities before adjustment for confounders were age, gender, duration of epilepsy, and seizure frequency. However, only frequency of seizure (P = 0.0018), gender (P < 0.0001), and age (P < 0.0001) were independently associated with EEG abnormalities. Conclusion: The study showed a modest yield (54%) of abnormal EEG in the cohort of patients with GE. Frequency of seizure, age, and gender, independently predicted the presence of EEG abnormality in people living with GE.

To achieve this goal, scalp EEG data are recorded from 16 subjects under the cold stimuli condition. The proposed method is capable of classifying four classes of tonic pain states, which include No pain, Minor Pain, Moderate Pain, and Severe Pain. Due to multi-class problem of our research an extended Common Spatial Pattern (ECSP) method is first proposed for accurately extracting features of tonic pain from captured EEG data. Then, a single-hidden-layer feedforward network is used as a classifier for pain identification. With the aid of extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, the classifier is trained here. The advantages of ELM-based classifier can obtain an optimal and generalized solution for multi-class tonic cold pain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method discriminates the tonic pain successfully. Additionally, to show the superiority for the ELM-based classifier, compared results with the well-known support vector machine (SVM) method show the ELM-based classifier outperform than the SVM-based classifier. These findings may pay the way for providing a direct and objective measure of the subjective perception of tonic pain.

J	Kaisar, S				Kaisar, Shahriar			Developmental dyslexia detection using machine learning techniques : A survey	ICT EXPRESS			English	Article						Dyslexia; Machine learning; Survey; EEG		Developmental dyslexia is a learning disability that occurs mostly in children during their early childhood. Dyslexic children face difficulties while reading, spelling and writing words despite having average or above-average intelligence. As a consequence, dyslexic children often suffer from negative feelings, such as low self-esteem, frustration, and anger. Therefore, early detection of dyslexia is very important to support dyslexic children right from the start. Researchers have proposed a wide range of techniques to detect developmental dyslexia, which includes game-based techniques, reading and writing tests, facial image capture and analysis, eye tracking, Magnetic reasoning imaging (MRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) scans. This survey paper critically analyzes recent contributions in detecting dyslexia using machine learning techniques and identify potential opportunities for future research.

J	Sun, JJ				Sun, Jianjun			Motor Imagery EEG Classification with Biclustering Based Fuzzy Inference	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG; CSP; BCI; Biclustering; Fuzzy Inference	MACHINE; ENHANCEMENT; COMPETITION	The rehabilitation of armless or footless patients is of great importance. One choice for such issue is using the electroencephalograph (EEG) brain computer interface to help the patients communicate with outside. Classifying the EEG signals generated from mental activity is one of the most important technologies. However, existing classification methods often suffer the overfitting problem caused by the small training data sets while big dimensionality of feature space. Fuzzy inference can imitate the human judgement, effectively dealing with uncertainty and small-sample learning problems. Besides, biclustering has shown excellent performance in constructing rule base. This paper proposes a novel biclustering based fuzzy inference method for EEG classification. It can be divided into five steps. The first step is generating features with common spatial pattern. The second step is searching local coherent patterns with column nearly constant biclustering. The third step is to transform the patterns to if-then rules with column averaging and majority voting strategy. Subsequent step is to employ Mamdani fuzzy inference to map the input feature vector into decimals. Finally, particle swarm optimization is utilized to generate optimal threshold for linear classification. Experiments on several commonly used data sets show that the proposed method has advantages over competitors in terms of classification accuracy.

J	Liu, Y; Jiang, B; Feng, J; Hu, JZ; Zhang, HB				Liu, Yang; Jiang, Bo; Feng, Jun; Hu, Jingzhao; Zhang, Haibo			Classification of EEG Signals for Epileptic Seizures Using Feature Dimension Reduction Algorithm based on LPP	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Epilepsy; Wavelet packet decomposition; Manifold learning; LPP; Machine learning	REPRESENTATION; ENTROPY	Computer-aided diagnosis of epilepsy based on Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is a beneficial practice which adopts machine learning to increase the recognition rate and saves physicians from long hours of EEG inspection. However multi-channel epilepsy EEG signals reflect significant nonlinearity with different degrees of cross-talk among channels, which further leads to high dimensional features extracted from EEG. These shortcomings make the performance of epilepsy detection with machine learning difficult to improve. In order to get fast and accurate detection performance, a feature dimension reduction algorithm based on epilepsy locality preserving projections (E-LPP) is proposed. E-LPP, by preserving the low-dimensional manifold as much as possible, enables to analyze signals of non-linear, non-stationary and high-dimensional nature. To get the best performance, we determine the hyperparameters of E-LPP by grid search. Subsequently a fusion epilepsy detection framework combined feature extraction with E-LPP is proposed to classify whether subjects' seizure onset or not. We test our method on two well-known and widely studied datasets which includes ictal and interictal EEG recordings. The experimental result on recall, precision and F1 is superior to the common traditional dimensionality reduction algorithm, manifold learning algorithm and autoencoder based deep learning, which indicates this proposed method not only makes it possible to solve nonlinearity and cross-talk among channels in EEG, but also tackles the inherent difficulties regarding unbalanced epilepsy data with high metrics.

The traditional diagnostic procedure relies on a recording of EEG from several days up to a few weeks, and the recordings are visually inspected by trained medical professionals. This procedure is time consuming with a high misdiagnosis rate. In recent years, computer-aided techniques have been proposed to automate the epilepsy diagnosis by using machine learning methods to analyze EEG data. Considering the time-varying nature of EEG, the goal of this work is to characterize dynamic changes of EEG patterns for the detection and classification of epilepsy. Four different dynamic Bayesian modeling methods were evaluated using multisubject epileptic EEG data. Experimental results show that an accuracy of 98.0% can be achieved by one of the four methods. The same method also provides an overall accuracy of 87.7% for the classification of seven different seizure types.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to changes in the functional state of the human brain, showing its potential to help doctors diagnose MDD. In this paper, an approach for identifying MDD by fusing interhemispheric asymmetry and cross-correlation with EEG signals is proposed and tested on 32 subjects [16 patients with MDD and 16 healthy controls (HCs)]. First, the structural features and connectivity features of the theta-, alpha-, and beta-frequency bands are extracted on the preprocessed and segmented EEG signals. Second, the structural feature matrix of the theta-, alpha-, and beta-frequency bands are added to and subtracted from the connectivity feature matrix to obtain mixed features. Finally, the structural features, connectivity features, and the mixed features are fed to three classifiers to select suitable features for the classification, and it is found that our mode achieves the best classification results using the mixed features. The results are also compared with those from some state-of-the-art methods, and we achieved an accuracy of 94.13%, a sensitivity of 95.74%, a specificity of 93.52%, and an F1-score (f1) of 95.62% on the data from Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University.

However, the traditional MEP-based method needs a bulky TMS device, and it involves the empirical judgement of an expert. In this study, we propose a machine-learning-based motor hotspot identification method using electroencephalography (EEG) that is portably acquired in a tES device. EEG data were measured from ten subjects while they performed a simple finger tapping task. Power spectral densities (PSDs) were extracted from the EEG data as features, and they were used to train and test artificial neural network (ANN). The 3D coordinate information of individual motor hotspots identified by TMS were also used as the ground-truth motor hotspot locations in ANN, and they were compared with those estimated by ANN. A minimum distance between the motor hotspots identified by TMS and EEG features was only 0.24 cm, demonstrating the feasibility of our proposed novel motor hotspot identification method based on EEG features.

EEG can be used to diagnose the abnormally functioning part of the brain by monitoring electrical activities. An automated system has been proposed to create a computer-based expert opinion needed in the detection of epilepsy and to capture a more objective view. To this end, the approximation and detail coefficients of EEG signals are calculated by using the wavelet packet transform (WPT). The coefficients were subjected to feature extraction using dispersion entropy and line length methods. The extracted feature vector has been applied as input to the support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifiers. The proposed method was tested using the public EEG seizure dataset created by the University of Bonn. In this study, the dataset was evaluated in two different ways as binary cases and multiclass cases. Evaluated classification accuracy was 100% for binary classification with SVM. For multiclass classification evaluated accuracy was 99.85% with KNN. The proposed method was compared with other methods in the literature using the same dataset. The comparison results provide the superiority of the proposed method.

Due to the nature of the EEG signals, EEG-based PI is typically done while a person is performing a mental task such as motor control. However, few studies used EEG-based PI while the person is in different mental states (affective EEG). The aim of this paper is to improve the performance of affective EEG-based PI using a deep learning (DL) approach. We proposed a cascade of DL using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). CNNs are used to handle the spatial information from the EEG while RNNs extract the temporal information. We evaluated two types of RNNs, namely long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The proposed method is evaluated on the state-of-the-art affective data set DEAP. The results indicate that CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM can perform PI from different affective states and reach up to 99.90%-100% mean correct recognition rate. This significantly outperformed a support vector machine baseline system that used power spectral density features. Notably, the 100% mean CRR came from 32 subjects in DEAP data set. Even after the reduction of the number of EEG electrodes from 32 to 5 for more practical applications, the model could still maintain an optimal result obtained from the frontal region, reaching up to 99.17%. Amongst the two DL models, we found that CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM performed similarly while CNN-GRU expended faster training time. In conclusion, the studied DL approaches overcame the influence of affective states in EEG-Based PI reported in the previous works.

However, the traditional feature selection methods are insufficient when building affective computing models between different subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection method termed as cross-subject recursive feature elimination (C-RFE) based on least square support vector machine to cope with this issue. This method is implemented through the absolute value of the component of the norm vector of the classification margin for all pairs of two subjects. The features are ranked in descending order of the importance via eliminating feature with the minimal contribution. The specific number of EEG feature subsets and emotion categories are operated in four machine learning models. The binary classification accuracy and F1-score of arousal and valence recognitions are achieved 0.6521, 0.6245, 0.6299 and 0.6295, respectively, for MAHNOB-HCI database, and 0.6461, 0.6176, 0.6529 and 0.6399, respectively for DEAP database.

Deep learning and feature based medication classifications from EEG in a large clinical data set	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; MACHINE	The amount of freely available human phenotypic data is increasing daily, and yet little is known about the types of inferences or identifying characteristics that could reasonably be drawn from that data using new statistical methods. One data type of particular interest is electroencephalographical (EEG) data, collected noninvasively from humans in various behavioral contexts. The Temple University EEG corpus associates thousands of hours of de-identified EEG records with contemporaneous physician reports that include metadata that might be expected to show a measurable correlation with characteristics of the recorded signal. Given that machine learning methods applied to neurological signals are being used in emerging diagnostic applications, we leveraged this data source to test the confidence with which algorithms could predict, using a patient's EEG record(s) as input, which medications were noted on the matching physician report. We comparatively assessed deep learning and feature-based approaches on their ability to distinguish between the assumed presence of Dilantin (phenytoin), Keppra (levetiracetam), or neither. Our methods could successfully distinguish between patients taking either anticonvulsant and those taking no medications; as well as between the two anticonvulsants. Further, we found different approaches to be most effective for different groups of classifications.

In this paper, a deep learning approach using a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm is investigated for the purpose of automatic discrimination between focal and non-focal epileptic EEG signals. The study is carried out by acquiring 7500 pairs of x and y EEG channels signals from the publicly available Bern-Barcelona EEG database. The manual classification of each signal type was visually done by two board-certified electroencephalographers and neurologists. Initially, every channel signals are pre-processed using -score normalization and Savitzky-Golay filtering. The signals are used as inputs to a pre-defined Bi-directional LSTM algorithm for the training process. The classification is performed using a k-fold cross-validation following 4-, 6-, and 10-fold schemes. At the end, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated using several metrics with a complete summary table of the recent state-of-art studies in the field. The developed algorithm achieved an overall Cohen & x2019;s kappa , accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of 99.20 & x0025;, 99.60 & x0025;, 99.55 & x0025;. and 99.65 & x0025;, respectively, using x channels and 10-fold cross-validation scheme. The study pave the ways toward implementing deep learning algorithms for the purpose of EEG signals identification in a clinical environment to overcome human errors resulting from visually inspection.

For this, various classification signal processing techniques have been developed in the traditional works. Still, they limit with the problems of increased complexity, reduced performance and insufficient classification rate. This motivates to design an automatic system for classifying the normal and abnormal EEG signals. Thus, an efficient machine learning approaches are implemented in this work, to overcome the existing techniques limitations. Here, an enhanced curvelet transform technique is established in order to overcome the disadvantage of Gabor and Wavelet transformations data loss and indiscriminate orientations. This method has the capacity to furnish the all the signals data required with no information loss of shearlet transformation and hence implemented to preprocess the given EEG signal, which smoothen the signal by eliminating the noise. Then, a modified graph theory, fractal dimension and novel pattern transformation techniques are employed to extract the features and patterns. The extraction of features is crucial for classification and compression of huge volume of EEG signal that possess low information. This theory improves the precision and speed of the computational technique. Most of the current research, Graph theory is reflected in the area of quantitative description of the time series data. It is predominantly employed for the reduction of noise and not affected during choosing the factors. From the patterns, the statistical features are extracted by using a standard gray level co-occurrence matrix technique that comprises entropy, homogeneity, energy, correlation and maximum probability. This method calculates the linear dependency of the adjacent samples thereby effective measurement of information loss in the transmitted signal is accomplished. Then, these extracted features are fed to the classifier named as novel random forest classification for detecting and classifying the signal as healthy, ictal and interictal. During simulation, various performance measures have been used for evaluating the results of existing and proposed classification techniques and results validate the efficacy of proposed technique.

The here-proposed system analyzes EEG signals from 8 wireless smart electrodes, placed in motor, and sensory-motor cortex area. For its functioning, the BCI exploits a specific brain activity patterns (BAP) elicited during the measurements by using clinical-inspired stimulation protocol that is suitable for the evocation of the Movement-Related Cortical Potentials (MRCPs). The proposed BCI analyzes the EEGs through symbolization-based algorithm: the Local Binary Patterning, which - due to its end-to-end binary nature - strongly reduces the computational complexity of the features extraction (FE) and real-time classification stages. As last step, the user intentions discrimination is entrusted to a weighted Support Vector Machine (wSVM) with linear kernel. The data have been collected from 3 subjects (aged 26 +/- 1), creating an overall dataset that consists of 391 +/- 106 observations per participant.

Professional eSports players have contracts with teams, perform daily routine training activities, and participate in tournaments. At the same time, similar to typical sportsmen, the eSports athletes suffer from injuries that significantly reduce their performance or even prevent them from participating in the training process or tournaments. Also, it is not a trivial task to evaluate the eSports athlete's performance in the training process or when hiring a new team member. In this study, we address these two issues. We use EEG recording to monitor the subject's performance status and use machine learning to find the correlation between EEG recordings and eSports athletes' performance. Professional eSports players and casual players (10 players from each group) participated in gaming sessions of 20 minutes while the EEG recordings were collected before and after the game for 10 minutes every time. After filtering and removing artifacts, we collected the statistical difference before and after the game and used them as the features for two binary classification problems: player professionalism and player health state. Our results demonstrated that machine learning models trained on EEG data can detect professional players with 95% F1-score and detect player health state with 90% F1-score on 10-fold cross-validation.

At present, most classifications and predictions of depression rely on different characteristics. Comparing with the previous work, we use local binary pattern (LBP) and signal singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technology to extract features from the original signal. Firstly, the LBP signal is obtained by encoding the segmented signal. Then, we use SSA to decompose and reconstruct the LBP signal to remove noise and divide the frequency band. Finally, we feed the data of each frequency band to K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) for classification. The experimental results show that LBP and SSA features achieve the best classification effect on SVM, and the accuracy of beta band is the highest with 99.24% accuracy, 99.34% sensitivity and 99.12% specificity respectively.

Ramasubba			Hilbert transform-based event-related patterns for motor imagery brain computer interface	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Event related patterns; Motor imagery	CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; SIGNAL	Event-related patterns (EPs) play an essential role in detecting motor imagery (MI) movements of the subject. Due to the difference in the spatial and temporal distribution of brain signals among the subjects, the extraction of EP is a major issue. To rectify this problem, the Hilbert transform (HT) was used for the detection of EPs, and the machine learning (ML) models were implemented for decoding MI movements. The proposed method comprises two steps: initially, mu(8-12 Hz) and ) beta(12-30 Hz) frequency bands were extracted from the raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. The HT was implemented on extracted mu and beta bands signals and the EPs were calculated. Finally, the EPs were fed into two ML models such as support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) for the detection of MI movements. The proposed method was tested on two benchmark datasets (BCI competition-III and IV). The results show that the mean classification accuracy (%CA) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (K) for BCI competition-III and IV were 86.11% & 0.72 and 82.50% & 0.65 respectively, which are higher than several existing methods.

Distance- and speed-informed kinematics decoding improves M/EEG based upper-limb movement decoder accuracy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; motor control; decoding; brain&#8211; computer interface; kinematics	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; UNSCENTED KALMAN FILTER; HAND MOVEMENTS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; ARM MOVEMENTS; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG-DATA; DIRECTION; SIGNALS; MEG	Objective. One of the main goals in brain-computer interface (BCI) research is the replacement or restoration of lost function in individuals with paralysis. One line of research investigates the inference of movement kinematics from brain activity during different volitional states. A growing number of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies suggest that information about directional (e.g. velocity) and nondirectional (e.g. speed) movement kinematics is accessible noninvasively. We sought to assess if the neural information associated with both types of kinematics can be combined to improve the decoding accuracy. Approach. In an offline analysis, we reanalyzed the data of two previous experiments containing the recordings of 34 healthy participants (15 EEG, 19 MEG). We decoded 2D movement trajectories from low-frequency M/EEG signals in executed and observed tracking movements, and compared the accuracy of an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) that explicitly modeled the nonlinear relation between directional and nondirectional kinematics to the accuracies of linear Kalman (KF) and Wiener filters which did not combine both types of kinematics. Main results. At the group level, posterior-parietal and parieto-occipital (executed and observed movements) and sensorimotor areas (executed movements) encoded kinematic information. Correlations between the recorded position and velocity trajectories and the UKF decoded ones were on average 0.49 during executed and 0.36 during observed movements. Compared to the other filters, the UKF could achieve the best trade-off between maximizing the signal to noise ratio and minimizing the amplitude mismatch between the recorded and decoded trajectories. Significance. We present direct evidence that directional and nondirectional kinematic information is simultaneously detectable in low-frequency M/EEG signals. Moreover, combining directional and nondirectional kinematic information significantly improves the decoding accuracy upon a linear KF.

Traditional hearing aids beamforming algorithms require the a priori knowledge of the auditory of the listener, which may not be available in real applications. Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) offer a potential non-invasive solution to this problem. The listener's auditory is derived from the EEG signals through auditory decoding algorithms and can be used as an input to the beamforming algorithms. In [1], a joint auditory decoding and adaptive beamforming algorithm framework by correlating the envelope of beamforming output and the EEG signal was proposed to improve the beamformer's robustness against decoding error. Consistent performance improvement was demonstrated on an EEG database recorded on listeners with fixed. In this study, we present the evaluation results of this joint formulation on a new EEG dataset collected on subjects with dynamic switch. We demonstrate not only the joint framework's performance improvement against decoding errors, but also its ability to capture listener's dynamic switch.

Imagining different joint movements from the same limb allows intuitive control of the outer devices. However, few researches focused on this field, and the decoding accuracy limited the applications for practical use. In this study, we aim to use deep learning methods to explore the ceiling of the decoding performance of three tasks: the resting state, the MI of right hand and right elbow. To represent the brain functional relationships, the correlation matrix that consists of correlation coefficients between electrodes (channels) was calculated as features. We proposed the Channel-Correlation Network to learn the overall representation among channels for classification. Ensemble learning was applied to integrate the output of multiple Channel-Correlation Networks. Our proposed method achieved the decoding accuracy of up to 87.03% in the 3-class scenario. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning method for decoding MI of different joints from the same limb and the potential of this fine paradigm to be applied in practice.

However, the classical CSP only focuses on the correlation between the signals and ignores all characteristics of the signals in the time domain and the frequency domain. In this paper we propose Common cross-spectral patterns (CCSP) a novel EEG feature extraction method for combining spectral and spatial patterns based on cross-spectral density (CSD) to overcome the disadvantages of classical CSP. In CCSP method. the cross-power matrices (CPMs) are extracted to measure the spatial correlation of each task in the band of interest. Then, an orthogonal linear transformation is constructed by simultaneously diagonalizing the CPMs of two tasks. Finally, each band & x2019;s logarithmic power of the transformed signals is extracted for the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The experiment results on multiple datasets showed that the CCSP algorithm is fully applicable to multi-channel EEG for reliable multi-cognitive-task identification.

To complement each modality's pros and cons, various hybrid NIRS-EEG studies have been investigated. However, most studies focused on enhancing the classification accuracy rather than analyzing the characteristics of used features. This study aimed to investigate whether EEG features from spatial, temporal, and spectral domains would exhibit the diverse efficacy in hybrid NIRS-EEG BCI. Open access NIRS and EEG recordings of left/ right hand gripping imagery from twenty-nine healthy subjects were utilized. Common spatial patterns (CSP), time domain parameters (TDP), and power spectral density (PSD) were separately employed with NIRS to evaluate the discrimination performance. Within dataset, NIRS with CSP showed the highest classification accuracy with linear support vector machine (LSVM) classifier (mean accuracy, 71.4%). For kernel SVM (KSVM) classifiers, mean accuracy of NIRS with TDP features was lower than accuracy of only NIRS features (mean accuracy, NIRS: 53.1% and NIRS with TDP: 50.5%). The findings suggested that binary motor imagery tasks, which involve localized brain activation, could be enhanced by applying features including rich spatial information.

To further boost the proficiency of SRC technique, in this paper, a weighted SRC (WSRC) has been proposed for classifying MI signals. In WSRC approach, a weighted dictionary has been constructed according to the dissimilarity information between a test data and training samples. Then for the given test data, the sparse coefficients are computed over the weighted dictionary using l(0)-minimization problem. The sparse solution obtained using WSRC gives discriminative information and as a consequence, WSRC proves to be superior for MI-based EEG classification. The experimental results substantiate that WSRC is more efficient and accurate than SRC.	[Sreeja, S.

An important component of BCI, electroencephalography (EEG) is in general sensitive to noise and rich in all kinds of information from our brain. In this paper, we study the feature fusion problem in electroencephalography (EEG). We introduce (1) a discriminative feature extractor which can classify multi-labels from short-term EEG signals, and (2) a new strategy to filter out unwanted features from EEG signals based on our feature extractor. Filtering out signals relating to one property of the EEG signal while retaining another is similar to the way we can listen to just one voice during a party, which is known as the cocktail party problem in the machine learning area. Built based on the success of short-term EEG discriminative model, the feature filter is an end-to-end framework which is trained to map EEG signals with unwanted features directly to EEG signals without those features. Our experimental results on an alcoholism dataset show that our novel model can filter out over 90% of alcoholism information on average from EEG signals, with an average of only 4.2% useful feature accuracy lost, showing effectiveness for our proposed task.

Hence, the observed brain dynamics are influenced both by the topology of the sensor array and the underlying functional connectivity. Neural engineers are currently exploiting the advances in the domain of graph signal processing in an attempt to create robust and reliable brain decoding systems. In this direction, Geometric Deep Learning is a highly promising concept for combining the benefits of graph signal processing and deep learning towards revolutionising Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, its exploitation has been hindered by its data-demanding character. As a remedy, we propose here a novel data augmentation approach that combines the multiplex network modelling of multichannel signal with a graph variant of the classical Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and which proves to be a strong asset when combined with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs). As our graph-EMD algorithm makes no assumptions with respect to linearity and stationarity, it appears as an appealing solution towards analysing brain signals without artificially imposing regularities in either temporal or spatial domain. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme for data augmentation leads to substantial improvement when it is combined with GCNNs. Using recordings from two distinct BCI applications and comparing against a state-of-the-art augmentation method, we illustrate the benefits from its use. By making it available to BCI community, we hope to further foster the application of geometric deep learning in the field.

However, most existing systems use either (i) a high-quality algorithm to train the data off-line and run only the classification in real-time since the off-line algorithm is too slow, or (ii) low-quality heuristics that are sufficiently fast for real-time training but introduce relatively large classification error. In this work, we propose a novel processing pipeline that allows real-time and parallel learning of EEG signals using high-quality but potentially inefficient algorithms. This is done by forging a link between BCI and coresets, a technique that originated in computational geometry for handling streaming data via data summarization. We suggest an algorithm that maintains the representation of such coresets tailored to handle the EEG signal which enables (i) real-time and continuous computation of the common spatial pattern (CSP) feature extraction method on a coreset representation of the signal (instead of the signal itself), (ii) improvement of CSP algorithm efficiency with provable guarantees by applying the CSP algorithm on the coreset, and (iii) real-time addition of the data trials (EEG data windows) to the coreset. For simplicity, we focus on the CSP algorithm, which is a classic algorithm. Nevertheless, we expect that our coreset will be extended to other algorithms in future papers. In the experimental results, we show that our system can indeed learn EEG signals in real-time in, for example, a 64-channel setup with hundreds of time samples per second.

Expert-level automated sleep staging of long-term scalp electroencephalography recordings using deep learning	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep staging; deep learning; EEG; machine learning; big data	INTERRATER RELIABILITY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; POLYSOMNOGRAPHY; MEDICINE; SYSTEM	Study Objectives: Develop a high-performing, automated sleep scoring algorithm that can be applied to long-term scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Methods: Using a clinical dataset of polysomnograms from 6,431 patients (MGH-PSG dataset), we trained a deep neural network to classify sleep stages based on scalp EEG data. The algorithm consists of a convolutional neural network for feature extraction, followed by a recurrent neural network that extracts temporal dependencies of sleep stages. The algorithm's inputs are four scalp EEG bipolar channels (F3-C3, C3-O1, F4-C4, and C4-O2), which can be derived from any standard PSG or scalp EEG recording. We initially trained the algorithm on the MGH-PSG dataset and used transfer learning to fine-tune it on a dataset of long-term (24-72 h) scalp EEG recordings from 112 patients (scalpEEG dataset). Results: The algorithm achieved a Cohen's kappa of 0.74 on the MGH-PSG holdout testing set and cross-validated Cohen's kappa of 0.78 after optimization on the scalpEEG dataset. The algorithm also performed well on two publicly available PSG datasets, demonstrating high generalizability. Performance on all datasets was comparable to the inter-rater agreement of human sleep staging experts (Cohen's kappa similar to 0.75 +/- 0.11). The algorithm's performance on long-term scalp EEGs was robust over a wide age range and across common EEG background abnormalities. Conclusion: We developed a deep learning algorithm that achieves human expert level sleep staging performance on long-term scalp EEG recordings. This algorithm, which we have made publicly available, greatly facilitates the use of large long-term EEG clinical datasets for sleep-related research.

Seizure detection hardware requires accurate feature extraction, which is conventionally done in the digital domain by extracting power in different EEG frequency bands over a particular time window. This paper presents an analog counterpart to digital feature extraction. A received signal strength indicator (RSSI) circuit is used for extracting EEG power features in the analog domain. A high-precision RSSI circuit was designed in the sub-threshold domain with ultra-low power consumption and low sensitivity to process-voltage-temperature variations with CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the RSSI circuit consumes 24 nW power, and has a dynamic range of 53 dB with a linearity error of +/- 0.5 dB, sufficient to accurately extract features for seizure classification. The analysis of 16 hours of patient EEG data indicates a seizure classification accuracy of 94%, and a non-seizure classification of 86%.

The automatic design of spectral and spatial filters is a challenging task, as the frequency bands of the spectral filters must be predefined by previously published studies and given that they may be affected during trials by artifacts and improper motor imagery (MI). This study aimed to eliminate the contaminated trials automatically during classifier training, and to simultaneously learn the spectral and spatial patterns without the need for predefined frequency bands. Compared with previous studies that measured the discriminative power of a frequency band based on mutual information, this study determined the difference of the class conditional probability density function between two MI classes. This information was further shared to measure the contamination level of the trial that simplified the computation. A particle-based approximation technique iteratively constructed a filter bank that extracted discriminative features, and simultaneously removed potentially contaminated trials. The particle weight was estimated by an analysis of variance F-test instead of mutual information as commonly used in previous studies. The experimental results of a publicly available dataset revealed that the proposed method outperformed the other BCI in terms of the classification accuracy. Asymmetrical spatial patterns were found on left- versus right-hand MI classifications. The learnt spectral and spatial patterns were consistent with prior neurophysiological knowledge.

It aims to capture local EEG signal dynamics by preserving the spatial relationships of EEG channels. We hypothesize that due to the global nature of EEG modulations, a better approach is to apply global unmixing filters. Using the BCI competition IV dataset 2a, we proposed three deep learning models: (1) one which applies multiple local spatial convolutions; (2) one which applies a global spatial convolution; and (3) a parallel architecture which combines both. Experiment results showed that the global model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 74.6% and outperformed the local and parallel architectures by 2.8% and 1.4%, respectively. It also outperformed the next best recorded result by 0.1%. By exploring the impact of local and global spatial filters on EEG-MI classification, this paper helps to advance the study of EEG feature representation within a deep learning framework.

However, it was not used to classify the left versus right foot KMI, due to its location inside the mesial wall of sensorimotor cortex, which makes it difficult to be detected. We report novel classification of mu and beta EEG features, during left and right foot KMI cognitive task, using CSP, and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method, to optimize the subject-specific band selection. We initially proposed CSP method, followed by the implementation of FBCSP for optimization of individual spatial patterns, wherein a set of CSP filters was learned, for each of the time/frequency filters in a supervised way. This was followed by the log-variance feature extraction and concatenation of all features (over all chosen spectral-filters). Subsequently, supervised machine learning was implemented, i.e. logistic regression (Logreg) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), in order to compare the respective foot KMI classification rates. Training and testing data, used in the model, was validated using 10-fold cross validation. Four methodology paradigms are reported, i.e. CSP LDA, CSP Logreg, and FBCSP LDA, FBCSP Logreg. All paradigms resulted in an average classification accuracy rate above the statistical chance level of 60.0% (P<0.01). On average, FBCSP LDA outperformed remaining paradigms with kappa score of 0.41 and classification accuracy of 70.28% 4.23. Similarly, this paradigm enabled discrimination between right and left foot KMI cognitive task at highest accuracy rate i.e. maximum 77.5% with kappa=0.55 and the area under ROC curve as 0.70 (in single-trial analysis). The proposed novel paradigms, using CSP and FBCSP, established a potential to exploit the left versus right foot imagery classification, in synchronous 2-class BCI for controlling robotic foot, or foot neuroprosthesis.

However, access to the representational content of neural activations early in life has remained limited. We asked whether patterns of neural activity elicited by complex visual stimuli (animals, human body) could be decoded from EEG data gathered from 12 15-month-old infants and adult controls. We assessed pairwise classification accuracy at each time-point after stimulus onset, for individual infants and adults. Classification accuracies rose above chance in both groups, within 500 ms. In contrast to adults, neural representations in infants were not linearly separable across visual domains. Representations were similar within, but not across, age groups. These findings suggest a developmental reorganization of visual representations between the second year of life and adulthood and provide a promising proof-of-concept for the feasibility of decoding EEG data within-subject to assess how the infant brain dynamically represents visual objects.

This paper presents the decoding of intuitive upper extremity imagery for multi-directional arm reaching tasks in three-dimensional (3D) environments. We designed and implemented an experimental environment in which electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be acquired for movement execution and imagery. Fifteen subjects participated in our experiments. We proposed a multi-directional convolution neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory network (MDCBN)-based deep learning framework. The decoding performances for six directions in 3D space were measured by the correlation coefficient (CC) and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between predicted and baseline velocity profiles. The grand-averaged CCs of multi-direction were 0.47 and 0.45 for the execution and imagery sessions, respectively, across all subjects. The NRMSE values were below 0.2 for both sessions. Furthermore, in this study, the proposed MDCBN was evaluated by two online experiments for real-time robotic arm control, and the grand-averaged success rates were approximately 0.60 (+/- 0.14) and 0.43 (+/- 0.09), respectively. Hence, we demonstrate the feasibility of intuitive robotic arm control based on EEG signals for real-world environments.

Methods: We propose a novel approach to align EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space to make them more similar, and hence improve the learning performance for a new subject. Our approach has three desirable properties: first, it aligns the EEG trials directly in the Euclidean space, and any signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the aligned trials; second, its computational cost is very low; and third, it is unsupervised and does not need any label information from the new subject. Results: Both offline and simulated online experiments on motor imagery classification and event-related potential classification verified that our proposed approach outperformed a state-of-the-art Riemannian space data alignment approach, and several approaches without data alignment. Conclusion: The proposed Euclidean space EEG data alignment approach can greatly facilitate transfer learning in BCIs. Significance: Our proposed approach is effective, efficient, and easy to implement. It could be an essential pre-processing step for EEG-based BCIs.

J	Khare, SK; Bajaj, V				Khare, Smith K.; Bajaj, Varun			A facile and flexible motor imagery classification using electroencephalogram signals	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalogram signals; Unsupervised multi-cluster channel selection; Flexible variational mode decomposition; Flexible extreme learning machine; Motor imagery classification	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; EEG SIGNALS; BCI; MACHINE	Background: Mind machine interface (MMI) enables communication with milieu by measuring brain activities. The reliability of MMI systems is highly dependent on the identification of various motor imagery (MI) tasks. Perfect discrimination of brain activities is required to avoid miscommunication. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a scrupulous solution for the development of MMI. Analysis of multi-channel EEG signals increases the burden of computation drastically. The extraction of hidden information from raw EEG signals is difficult due to its complex nature. A signal is needed to be decomposed and classified for the extraction of hidden information from it. But selecting the uniform decomposition and hyperparameters for decomposition and classification of the signal can lead to information loss and misclassification. Method: This paper presents a novel method for identifying right-hand and right-foot MI tasks. The method employs a single-channel adaptive decomposition and EEG signal classification. The multi-cluster unsupervised learning method is employed for the selection of significant channel. Further, flexible variational mode decomposition (F-VMD) is used for the adaptive decomposition of signals. The values of decomposition parameters are selected adaptively following the nature of EEG signals. The value of decomposition parameters is used to decompose the signals into narrow-band modes. Hjorth, entropy and quartile based features are elicited from the modes of F-VMD. These features are classified by using a flexible extreme learning machine (F-ELM). F-ELM selects the hyperparameters and kernel adaptively by reducing the classification error. Results: The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by measuring five performance parameters namely accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and F-1 score. An ACC, SEN, SPE, MCC and F-1 score is obtained as 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 1. The performance parameters obtained by the proposed method prove the superiority over other methodologies using the same data-set. Conclusion: The proposed method proved to be promising and efficient with a single channel and two features. This framework can be utilized for the development of a real-time mind-machine interface like robotic arm, wheel chairs, etc. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many past BCI designs used visual stimuli, due to the robustness of neural signatures evoked by visual input. However, these BCI systems can only be used when visual attention is available. This study proposes a new BCI design using auditory stimuli, decoding spatial attention from electroencephalography (EEG). Results show that this new approach can decode attention with a high accuracy (>75%) and has a high information transfer rate (>10 bits/min) compared to other auditory BCI systems. It also has the potential to allow decoding that does not depend on subject-specific training.

J	Jo, SY; Jeong, JW				Jo, Sang-Yeong; Jeong, Jin-Woo			Prediction of Visual Memorability with EEG Signals: A Comparative Study	SENSORS			English	Article						visual memorability; electroencephalography; deep learning; machine learning		Visual memorability is a method to measure how easily media contents can be memorized. Predicting the visual memorability of media contents has recently become more important because it can affect the design principles of multimedia visualization, advertisement, etc. Previous studies on the prediction of the visual memorability of images generally exploited visual features (e.g., color intensity and contrast) or semantic information (e.g., class labels) that can be extracted from images. Some other works tried to exploit electroencephalography (EEG) signals of human subjects to predict the memorability of text (e.g., word pairs). Compared to previous works, we focus on predicting the visual memorability of images based on human biological feedback (i.e., EEG signals). For this, we design a visual memory task where each subject is asked to answer whether they correctly remember a particular image 30 min after glancing at a set of images sampled from the LaMemdataset. During the visual memory task, EEG signals are recorded from subjects as human biological feedback. The collected EEG signals are then used to train various classification models for prediction of image memorability. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of classification models, including deep convolutional neural networks and classical methods, such as support vector machines, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors. The experimental results validate that the EEG-based prediction of memorability is still challenging, but a promising approach with various opportunities and potentials.

Some electroencephalography (EEG) tasks suffer from low samples-to-features ratio, severely reducing DL effectiveness. DA with DL thus holds transformative promise for EEG processing, possibly like DL revolutionized computer vision, etc. New method: We review trends and approaches to DA for DL in EEG to address: Which DA approaches exist and are common for which EEG tasks? What input features are used? And, what kind of accuracy gain can be expected? Results: DA for DL on EEG begun 5 years ago and is steadily used more. We grouped DA techniques (noise addition, generative adversarial networks, sliding windows, sampling, Fourier transform, recombination of segmentation, and others) and EEG tasks (into seizure detection, sleep stages, motor imagery, mental workload, emotion recognition, motor tasks, and visual tasks). DA efficacy across techniques varied considerably. Noise addition and sliding windows provided the highest accuracy boost; mental workload most benefitted from DA. Sliding window, noise addition, and sampling methods most common for seizure detection, mental workload, and sleep stages, respectively. Comparing with existing methods: Percent of decoding accuracy explained by DA beyond unaugmented accuracy varied between 8 % for recombination of segmentation and 36 % for noise addition and from 14 % for motor imagery to 56 % for mental workload-29 % on average. Conclusions: DA increasingly used and considerably improved DL decoding accuracy on EEG. Additional publications-if adhering to our reporting guidelines-will facilitate more detailed analysis.

In more than 30 & x0025; of the cases, people affected by this disease cannot be cured with medicines or surgery. However, predicting a seizure before it actually occurs can help in its prevention; through therapeutic intervention. Studies have observed that abnormal activity inside the brain begins a few minutes before the start of a seizure, which is known as preictal state. Many researchers have tried to find a way for predicting this preictal state of a seizure but an effective prediction in terms of high sensitivity and specificity still remains a challenge. The current study, proposes a seizure prediction system that employs deep learning methods. This method includes preprocessing of scalp EEG signals, automated features extraction; using convolution neural network and classification with the support of vector machines. The proposed method has been applied on 24 subjects of scalp EEG dataset of CHBMIT resulting in successfully achieving an average sensitivity and specificity of 92.7 & x0025; and 90.8 & x0025; respectively.

Early assessment of markers of recovery can allow personalized interventions; however, it is difficult to deliver indexes in the acute phase able to predict recovery. In this perspective, evaluation of electrical brain activity may provide useful information. A machine learning approach was explored here to predict post-stroke recovery relying on multi-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of few minutes performed at rest. A data-driven model, based on partial least square (PLS) regression, was trained on 19-channel EEG recordings performed within 10 days after mono-hemispheric stroke in 101 patients. The band-wise (delta: 1-4Hz, theta: 4-7Hz, alpha: 8-14Hz and beta: 15-30Hz) EEG effective powers were used as features to predict the recovery at 6 months (based on clinical status evaluated through the NIH Stroke Scale, NIHSS) in an optimized and cross-validated framework. In order to exploit the multimodal contribution to prognosis, the EEG-based prediction of recovery was combined with NIHSS scores in the acute phase and both were fed to a nonlinear support vector regressor (SVR). The prediction performance of EEG was at least as good as that of the acute clinical status scores. A posteriori evaluation of the features exploited by the analysis highlighted a lower delta and higher alpha activity in patients showing a positive outcome, independently of the affected hemisphere. The multimodal approach showed better prediction capabilities compared to the acute NIHSS scores alone (r = 0.53 versus r = 0.41, AUC = 0.80 versus AUC = 0.70, p < 0.05). The multimodal and multivariate model can be used in acute phase to infer recovery relying on standard EEG recordings of few minutes performed at rest together with clinical assessment, to be exploited for early and personalized therapies. The easiness of performing EEG may allow such an approach to become a standard-of-care and, thanks to the increasing number of labeled samples, further improving the model predictive power.

ERD and ERS are examples of such patterns related to movement, for example of a hand, finger or foot. This article deals with the detection of motion based on the ERD/ERS patterns. By linking ERD/ERS, feature vectors which are later classified by neural network are created. The resulting neural network consists of one input and one output layer and two hidden layers. The first hidden layer contains 3,000 neurons and the second one 1,500 neurons. A training set of feature vectors is used for the training of this neural network and the back-propagation algorithm is used for the subsequent adjustment of the weights. With this setting and training, the neural network is able to classify motion in an EEG record with an average accuracy of 79.92%.

Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to the BCI to reduce the time required for recording training data. However, more evidence is required due to lack of comparison. To reveal more evidence, this study proposed a deep learning method named time-wise convolutional neural network (TWCNN), which was applied to a BCI dataset. In the evaluation, EEG data from a subject was classified utilizing previously recorded EEG data from other subjects. As a result, TWCNN showed the highest accuracy, which was significantly higher than the typically used classifier. The results suggest that the deep learning method may be useful to reduce the recording time of training data.

To achieve such flexible and purposeful control of the human body, brain systems exhibit extensive modulation during the transition from resting state to motor execution and to maintain proper joint impedance. However, the neural structures contributing to such sensorimotor control under unconstrained and naturalistic conditions are not fully characterized. To elucidate which brain regions are implicated in generating and coordinating voluntary movements, we employed a physiologically inspired, two-stage method to decode relaxation and three patterns of contraction in unilateral finger muscles (i.e., extension, flexion, and co-contraction) from high-density scalp electroencephalograms (EEG). The decoder consisted of two parts employed in series. The first discriminated between relaxation and contraction. If the EEG data were discriminated as contraction, the second stage then discriminated among the three contraction patterns. Despite the difficulty in dissociating detailed contraction patterns of muscles within a limb from scalp EEG signals, the decoder performance was higher than chance-level by 2-fold in the four-class classification. Moreover, weighted features in the trained decoders revealed EEG features differentially contributing to decoding performance. During the first stage, consistent with previous reports, weighted features were localized around sensorimotor cortex (SM1) contralateral to the activated fingers, while those during the second stage were localized around ipsilateral SM1. The loci of these weighted features suggested that the coordination of unilateral finger muscles induced different signaling patterns in ipsilateral SM1 contributing to motor control. Weighted EEG features enabled a deeper understanding of human sensorimotor processing as well as of a more naturalistic control of brain-computer interfaces.

For classification, electroencephalographic signals were obtained using an EEG device from 17 subjects in three mental states (relaxation, excitation, and solving logical task). Blind source separation employing independent component analysis (ICA) was performed on obtained signals. Welch's method, autoregressive modeling, and discrete wavelet transform were used for feature extraction. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in order to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN) were employed for classification. Precision, recall, F1 score, as well as a discussion based on statistical analysis, were shown. The paper also contains code utilized in preprocessing and the main part of experiments.

Adaptive Virtual Environments using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence	ANNUAL REVIEW OF CYBERTHERAPY AND TELEMEDICINE			English	Article						Adaptive; Virtual Environments; EEG; Simulations; Gaming; Learning; Training; Diagnose; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Real-Time Feedback	INDEXES; EEG	Advances in off-the-shelf sensor technology have aided the collection of psychophysiological data in real-time. Utilizing these low-cost sensors, researchers can monitor a person's cognitive, behavioral, and affective states (in real-time) as they interact within virtual environments. Moreover, this psychophysiological data can be used to develop adaptive virtual environments. In this paper, we explore electroencephalography-based algorithms to optimize flow models. These algorithms use various combinations of brain wave channels to develop indices of task engagement (Beta / (Alpha + Theta)), arousal (BetaF3 + BetaF4) / (AlphaF3 + AlphaF4), and valence (AlphaF4 / BetaF4) - (AlphaF3 / BetaF3). Results support accurate determination of when a person has left a state of flow. Moreover, the reported results can be further modeled using machine learning (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor) to develop training classifiers used in our adaptive virtual environments. We purpose a set of rules for the development of an adaptive virtual environment that can adjust environmental stimuli to keep the user in a state of flow.

However, the neurophysiological processes underpinning the SMR often vary over time and across subjects. Inherent intra- and inter-subject variability causes covariate shift in data distributions that impede the transferability of model parameters amongst sessions/subjects. Transfer learning includes machine learning-based methods to compensate for inter-subject and inter-session (intra-subject) variability manifested in EEG-derived feature distributions as a covariate shift for BCI. Besides transfer learning approaches, recent studies have explored psychological and neurophysiological predictors as well as inter-subject associativity assessment, which may augment transfer learning in EEG-based BCI. Here, we highlight the importance of measuring inter-session/subject performance predictors for generalized BCI frameworks for both normal and motor-impaired people, reducing the necessity for tedious and annoying calibration sessions and BCI training.

Estimation of phase in EEG rhythms for real-time applications	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); real-time; closed-loop; phase estimation; alpha-rhythm; causal filtering	TRANSCRANIAL BRAIN-STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; EXCITABILITY; STATES; ERP	Objective.Estimating the ongoing phase of oscillations in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is an important aspect of understanding brain function, as well as for the development of phase-dependent closed-loop real-time systems that deliver stimuli. Such stimuli may take the form of direct brain stimulation (for example transcranial magnetic stimulation), or sensory stimuli (for example presentation of an auditory stimulus). We identify two linked problems related to estimating the phase of EEG rhythms with a specific focus on the alpha-band: 1) when the signal after a specific stimulus is unknown (real-time case), or 2) when it is corrupted by the presence of the stimulus itself (offline analysis). We propose methods to estimate the phase at the presentation time of these stimuli.Approach.Machine learning methods are used to learn the causal mapping from an unprocessed EEG recording to a phase estimate generated with a non-causal signal processing chain. This mapping is then used to predict the phase causally where non-causal methods are inappropriate.Main results.We demonstrate the ability of these machine learning methods to estimate instantaneous phase from an EEG signal subjected to very minor pre-processing with higher accuracy than commonly used signal-processing methods.Significance.Neural oscillations have been implicated in a wide variety of sensory, cognitive and motor functions. The instantaneous phase of these rhythms may reflect specific processes of computation which can be acted upon if they can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. Such brain-state dependent paradigms are of increasing medical and scientific interest.	[McIntosh, J.

While conventional methods like Artificial neural network (ANN), Linear discernment analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), etc. have made significant progress in terms of classification accuracy, deep transfer learning-based systems have shown the potential to outperform them. BCI can play a vital role in enabling communication with the external world for persons with motor disabilities. New Methods: Deep learning has been a success in many fields. However, for Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, relatively minimal work has been carried out using deep learning. This paper proposes a combination of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) along with deep learning-based transfer learning to solve the problem. CWT transforms one dimensional EEG signals into two-dimensional time-frequency-amplitude representation enabling us to exploit available deep networks through transfer learning. Results: The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in this study using an openly available BCI competition data-set. The results of the approach have been compared to earlier works on the same dataset, and a promising validation accuracy of 95.71% is achieved in our investigation. Comparison with existing methods and Conclusion: Our approach has shown significant improvement over other studies, which is 5.71% improvement over earlier reported algorithm (Tabar and Halici, 2017) using the same dataset. Results show the validity of the proposed Deep Transfer-Learning based technique as a state of the art technique for MI classification in BCI.

However, relevant features of cognitive states are hidden behind in multiple sources of cortical neural responses. In this study, we developed a novel neural network ensemble, SE-SDAE, based on stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs) which identify different levels of cognitive load by electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To improve the generalization capability of the ensemble framework, a stacking-based approach is adopted to fuse the abstracted EEG features from activations of deep-structured hidden layers. In particular, we also combine multiple K-nearest neighbor and naive Bayesian classifiers with SDAEs to generate a heterogeneous classification committee to enhance ensemble's diversity.

J	Halim, Z; Rehan, M				Halim, Zahid; Rehan, Mahma			On identification of driving-induced stress using electroencephalogram signals: A framework based on wearable safety-critical scheme and machine learning	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Information fusion; EEG; Emotion recognition; Driving-induced stress; Stress prediction	NEGATIVE EMOTIONS; MENTAL STRESS; GAMMA-BAND; ANGER; DRIVERS; ASYMMETRY; RESPONSES; SYSTEM; IMPACT; ROAD	Driving an automobile under high stress level reduces driver's control on vehicle and risk-assessment capabilities, often resulting in road accidents. Driver's anxiety therefore is a key factor to consider in accident prevention and road safety. This emphasizes the modern computing techniques to assist drivers by continuous stress level monitoring. Development of such a system requires designing a framework, which can recognize the drivers' affective state and take preventive measures to account for escalating stress level. This work presents a machine learning-based approach to identify driving-induced stress patterns. For this, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are utilized as the physiological signals. The ongoing brain activity is logged as EEG signal to determine the link between brain dynamics and emotional states. Three classifiers are utilized in this work, namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Random Forest (RF) to classify EEG patterns on the basis of the subject's self-reported emotional states while driving in various situations. A framework is proposed to recognize emotions based on EEG patterns by systematically identifying emotion-specific features from the raw EEG signal and investigating the classifiers' effectiveness. A comprehensive analysis of various performance measures concludes that among the three classifiers employed in this study, SVM performs better to distinguish between rest and stress state. The evaluation obtained an average classification accuracy of 97.95% +/- 2.65%, precision of 89.23%, sensitivity of 88.83%, and specificity of 94.92%; when tested over 50 automotive drivers.

Recently, EEG brain waves are used to recognize the emotional states of a person. Attention level also plays an important role in human life, but still demands more investigation. This paper proposes a noble human attention level recognition system using advanced machine learning algorithms. The system is cost-effective, single-channeled, and time-frequency scalp-EEG signals-based. In this study, the Bitalino EEG sensor board is used to record EEG signals from 30 human subjects in different attention states. Initially, the attention level was classified into three categories, which are focused, neutral and distracted. The data was taken while the subjects were watching interesting videos and boring lectures, doing simple and interesting math problems, and solving interesting and hard puzzles. At first, these EEG signals are pre-processed to remove noise such as muscle movement. Statistical coefficients (i.e. mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy) and statistical wavelet transform are used to extract meaningful features from the EEG signal. We mainly used two multi-scale wavelet packet statistics (WPS) and multi-scale wavelet packet energy statistics (WPES) to generate the feature vector. This feature vector was used to train the complex hybrid model with CNN and LSTM. This proposed method achieved almost 89% accuracy while determining the attention level of a subject.

In the past, some work used convolutional networks to process EEG signals and reached or exceeded traditional machine learning methods. We propose a novel network structure and call it QNet. It contains a newly designed attention module: 3D-AM, which is used to learn the attention weights of EEG channels, time points, and feature maps. It provides a way to automatically learn the electrode and time selection. QNet uses a dual branch structure to fuse bilinear vectors for classification. It performs four, three, and two classes on the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset. The average cross-validation accuracy of 65.82%, 74.75%, and 82.88% was obtained, which are 7.24%, 4.93%, and 2.45% outperforms than the state-of-the-art, respectively.

By implementing a conceptual model "cup-and-ball" system, EEG signals in manipulating the dynamic constrained objects are generated. Based on the operational EEG signals, a method is proposed to recognize different mental intentions. Under the manipulating task with a high arousal level, common spatial patterns (CSP) is used to extract and optimize features of the EEG signals from ten participants. Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) is implemented on EEG signals in different dimensions to identify different EEG patterns. The cross-validation is used to make classifier adaptive to a given data set. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are presented to illustrate recognition performance. The classification effect of QDA is verified by paired t-test (P < 0.001). Based on the proposed method, the average accuracy of mental intentions is 0.9857 +/- 0.0191 and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.9665 +/- 0.0291. The performance of QDA is also compared with the other three classifiers such as the support vector machine (SVM), the decision tree (DT) and the k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN) rule. The results suggest that the proposed method is very competitive with other methods.

Human brain activity can be studied by analyzing the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. In this way, scientists have employed several techniques that investigate nonlinear dynamics of EEG signals. Fractal theory as a promising technique has shown its capabilities to analyze the nonlinear dynamics of time series. Since EEG signals have fractal patterns, in this research we analyze the variations of fractal dynamics of EEG signals between four datasets that were collected from healthy subjects with open-eyes and close-eyes conditions, patients with epilepsy who did and patients who did not face seizures. The obtained results showed that EEG signal during seizure has greatest complexity and the EEG signal during the seizure-free interval has lowest complexity. In order to verify the obtained results in case of fractal analysis, we employ approximate entropy, which indicates the randomness of time series. The obtained results in case of approximate entropy certified the fractal analysis results. The obtained results in this research show the effectiveness of fractal theory to investigate the nonlinear structure of EEG signal between different conditions.

This procedure requires approximately 20-30 min to collect enough data to build a reliable decoder. It is, therefore, an interesting topic to build a calibration-free, or subject-independent, BCI. In this article, we construct a large motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalography (EEG) database and propose a subject-independent framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The database is composed of 54 subjects performing the left- and right-hand MI on two different days, resulting in 21 600 trials for the MI task. In our framework, we formulated the discriminative feature representation as a combination of the spectral-spatial input embedding the diversity of the EEG signals, as well as a feature representation learned from the CNN through a fusion technique that integrates a variety of discriminative brain signal patterns. To generate spectral-spatial inputs, we first consider the discriminative frequency bands in an information-theoretic observation model that measures the power of the features in two classes. From discriminative frequency bands, spectral-spatial inputs that include the unique characteristics of brain signal patterns are generated and then transformed into a covariance matrix as the input to the CNN. In the process of feature representations, spectral-spatial inputs are individually trained through the CNN and then combined by a concatenation fusion technique. In this article, we demonstrate that the classification accuracy of our subject-independent (or calibration-free) model outperforms that of subject-dependent models using various methods [common spatial pattern (CSP), common spatiospectral pattern (CSSP), filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and Bayesian spatio-spectral filter optimization (BSSFO)].

J	Okumura, A				Okumura, Akihisa			Electroencephalography in neonatal epilepsies	PEDIATRICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						amplitude-integrated EEG; conventional EEG; ictal changes; suppression-burst	AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED EEG; KCNQ2 ENCEPHALOPATHY; SEIZURES; NEWBORNS; NEUROPHYSIOLOGY; CHILDREN; PROFILE	Neonatal epilepsies - neonatal seizures caused by remote symptomatic etiologies - are infrequent compared with those caused by acute symptomatic etiologies. The etiologies of neonatal epilepsies are classified into structural, genetic, and metabolic. Electroencephalography (EEG) and amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) are essential for the diagnosis and monitoring of neonatal epilepsies. Electroencephalography / aEEG findings may differ substantially among infants, even within infants with variants in a single gene. Unusual EEG/aEEG findings, such as downward seizure patterns on aEEG, can be found. Neonatal seizures are exclusively of focal onset. An International League Against Epilepsy task force proposed that the seizure type is typically determined by the predominant clinical feature and is classified into motor or non-motor presentations. Ictal EEG usually demonstrates a sudden, repetitive, evolving, and stereotyped activities with a minimum duration of 10 s. In epileptic spasms and myoclonic seizures, the cut-off point of 10 s cannot be applied. One must always be aware of electro-clinical dissociation in neonates suspected to have seizures. Amplitude-integrated EEG is also useful for the diagnosis and monitoring of neonatal epilepsies but aEEG cannot be recommended as the mainstay because of its relatively low sensitivity and specificity. At present, EEG findings are not pathognomonic, although some characteristic ictal or interictal EEG findings have been reported in several neonatal epilepsies. Deep learning will be expected to be introduced into EEG interpretation in near future. Objective EEG classification derived from deep learning may help to clarify EEG characteristics in some specific cases of neonatal epilepsy.

While achieving high classification accuracy, DL models have also grown in size, requiring a vast amount of memory and computational resources. This poses a major challenge to an embedded BMI solution that guarantees user privacy, reduced latency, and low power consumption by processing the data locally. In this paper, we propose EEG-TCNET, a novel temporal convolutional network (TCN) that achieves outstanding accuracy while requiring few trainable parameters. Its low memory footprint and low computational complexity for inference make it suitable for embedded classification on resource-limited devices at the edge. Experimental results on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset show that EEG-TCNET achieves 77.35% classification accuracy in 4-class MI. By finding the optimal network hyperparameters per subject, we further improve the accuracy to 83.84%. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of EEG- TCNET on the Mother of All BCI Benchmarks (MOABB), a large scale test benchmark containing 12 different EEG datasets with MI experiments. The results indicate that EEG- TCNET successfully generalizes beyond one single dataset, outperforming the current state-of-the-art (SoA) on MOABB by a meta-effect of 0.25.

J	Cheah, KH; Nisar, H; Yap, VV; Lee, CY				Cheah, Kit Hwa; Nisar, Humaira; Yap, Vooi Voon; Lee, Chen-Yi			Convolutional neural networks for classification of music-listening EEG: comparing 1D convolutional kernels with 2D kernels and cerebral laterality of musical influence	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Deep learning; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Kernel; Music; Brain lateralization	HUMAN BRAIN	This paper highlights the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at classifying EEG data listening to different kinds of music without the requirement for handcrafted features. Deep learning architectures presented in this paper include CNN of different depths and different convolutional kernels. Support vector machine (SVM) taking in EEG features describing the frequency spectrum, signal regularity, and cross-channel correlation has been applied for performance comparison with CNN. The best performing CNN model presented in this paper achieves the tenfold cross-validation (CV) binary classification average accuracy of 98.94% (validation) and 97.46% (test), and the tenfold CV three-class classification accuracy of 97.68% (validation) and 95.71% (test). In comparison, the SVM classifier achieves tenfold CV binary classification accuracy of 80.23% (validation). The CNN model presented is able to not only differentiate EEG of subjects listening to music from that of subjects without auditory input, but it is also capable of accurately differentiating the EEG of subjects listening to different music. In the context of designing neural computing models for EEG analysis, this paper shows that decomposing two-dimensional spatiotemporal convolutional kernels into separate one-dimensional spatial and one-dimensional temporal kernels significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters (size) of the model while retaining the classification performance. This finding is useful, especially in designing CNN for memory-critical embedded systems for EEG processing. In neurological aspect, auditory stimulus is found to have altered the EEG pattern of the frontal lobe and the left cerebral hemisphere more than the other brain regions.

However, most of these studies focus on the properties of single channel EEG data while neglecting the association between signals from diverse channels. To bridge this gap, we propose an EEG instance matching-based epilepsy classification approach by introducing one convolutional neural network (CNN). First of all, each pair of EEG signals are exploited to form one 2 dimensional matrix, which could be used to reveal the interaction between them. Secondly, the generated matrices are fed into the proposed CNN that would discriminate the input representations. To evaluate the performance of the presented approach, the comparison experiments between the state-of-the-art techniques and our work are conducted on publicly available epilepsy EEG benchmark database. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm could yield the performance with an average accuracy of 99.3 & x0025;, average sensitivity of 99.5 & x0025;, and average specificity 99.6 & x0025;.

However, access to ECT has been limited by high costs, professional labor, treatment duration, and significant adverse effects. To provide support for the decision to perform ECT, we aimed to predict individual responses to ECT among patients with schizophrenia using machine learning analysis of resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Forty-seven patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with EEG recordings before the course of ECT were treated at Seoul National University Hospital. Among these patients, 29 were responders who showed scores of 3 or less on the Clinical Global Impression Severity scale after the course of ECT. Transfer entropy (TE), which represents information flow, was extracted from baseline EEG data and used as a feature. Feature selection was performed with four methods, including Random Subset Feature Selection (RSFS). The random forest classifier was used to predict individual ECT responses. Results: The averaged TE, especially in frontal regions, was higher in ECT responders than in nonresponders. A predictive model using the RSFS method classified ECT responders and nonresponders with 85.3% balanced accuracy, 85.2% accuracy, 88.7% sensitivity, and 81.8% specificity. The positive predictive value was 82.6%, and the negative predictive value was 88.2%. Conclusions: The results of the current study suggest that higher effective connectivity in frontal areas may be associated with a favorable ECT response. Furthermore, personalized decisions to perform ECT in clinical practice could be augmented by resting-state EEG biomarkers of the ECT response in schizophrenia patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

While deep neural networks are recently emerging as generic EEG feature extractors, this transfer learning aspect usually relies on the prior assumption that deep networks naturally behave as subject- (or session-) invariant EEG feature extractors. We propose a further step towards invariance of EEG deep learning frameworks in a systemic way during model training. We introduce an adversarial inference approach to learn representations that are invariant to inter-subject variabilities within a discriminative setting. We perform experimental studies using a publicly available motor imagery EEG dataset, and state-of-the-art convolutional neural network based EEG decoding models within the proposed adversarial learning framework. We present our results in cross-subject model transfer scenarios, demonstrate neurophysiological interpretations of the learned networks, and discuss potential insights offered by adversarial inference to the growing field of deep learning for EEG.

We investigated whether electroencephalography (EEG) features obtained from EEG source network analyses could be effectively applied to classify the SZ subtypes based on symptom severity. Sixty-four electrode EEG signals were recorded from 119 patients with SZ (53 males and 66 females) and 119 normal controls (NC, 51 males and 68 females) during resting-state with closed eyes. Brain network features (global and local clustering coefficient and global path length) were calculated from EEG source activities. According to positive, negative, and cognitive/disorganization symptoms, the SZ patients were divided into two groups (high and low) by positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS). To select features for classification, we used the sequential forward selection (SFS) method. The classification accuracy was evaluated using 10 by 10-fold cross-validation with the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The best classification accuracy was 80.66% for estimating SZ patients from the NC group. The best classification accuracy between low and high groups in positive, negative, and cognitive/disorganization symptoms were 88.10%, 75.25%, and 77.78%, respectively. The selected features well-represented the pathological brain regions of SZ. Our study suggested that resting-state EEG network features could successfully classify between SZ patients and the NC, and between low and high SZ groups in positive, negative, and cognitive/disorganization symptoms.

Easy Perturbation EEG Algorithm for Spectral Importance (easyPEASI): A Simple Method to Identify Important Spectral Features of EEG in Deep Learning Models	KDD '20: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY & DATA MINING			English	Proceedings Paper	26th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD)	AUG 23-27, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Assoc Comp Machinery, ACM SIGMOD, ACM SIGKDD		Deep Learning; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Electroencephalography (EEG)		Efforts into understanding neurological differences between populations is an active area of research. Deep learning has recently shown promising results using EEG as input to distinguish recordings of subjects based on neurological activity. However, only about one quarter of these studies investigate the underlying neurophysiological implications. This work proposes and validates a method to investigate frequency bands important to EEG-driven deep learning models. Easy perturbation EEG algorithm for spectral importance (easyPEASI) is simpler than previous methods and requires only perturbations to input data. We validate easyPEASI on EEG pathology classification using the Temple University Health EEG Corpus. easyPEASI is further applied to characterize the effects of patients' medications on brain rhythms. We investigate classifications of patients taking one of two anticonvulsant medications, Dilantin (phenytoin) and Keppra (levetiracetam), and subjects taking no medications. We find that for recordings of subjects with clinically-determined normal EEG that these medications effect the Theta and Alpha band most significantly. For recordings with clinically-determined abnormal EEG these medications affected the Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands most significantly. We also find the Beta band to be affected differently by the two medications. Results found here show promise for a method of obtaining explainable artificial intelligence and interpretable models from EEG-driven deep learning through a simpler more accessible method perturbing only input data. Overall, this work provides a fast, easy, and reproducible method to automatically determine salient spectral features of neural activity that have been learned by machine learning models, such as deep learning.

It is extremely important for drug-refractory patients. Conventional seizure prediction works usually rely on features extracted from Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and classification algorithms such as regression or support vector machine (SVM) to locate the short time before seizure onset. However, such methods cannot achieve high-accuracy prediction due to information loss of the hand-crafted features and the limited classification ability of regression and SVM algorithms. We propose an end-to-end deep learning solution using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in this paper. One and two dimensional kernels are adopted in the early- and late-stage convolution and max-pooling layers, respectively. The proposed CNN model is evaluated on Kaggle intracranial and CHB-MIT scalp EEG datasets. Overall sensitivity, false prediction rate, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve reaches 93.5%, 0.063/h, 0.981 and 98.8%, 0.074/h, 0.988 on two datasets respectively. Comparison with state-of-the-art works indicates that the proposed model achieves exceeding prediction performance.

Substantial progress has been made during the past decades, mainly by using EEG features extracted from localized brain activities. The present study explored a brain network-based feature defined by EEG microstates for a possible representation of emotional experiences. A publicly available and widely used benchmarking EEG dataset called DEAP was used, in which 32 participants watched 40 one-minute music videos with their 32-channel EEG recorded. Four quasi-stable prototypical microstates were obtained, and their temporal parameters were extracted as features. In random forest regression, the microstate features showed better performances for decoding valence (model fitting mean squared error (MSE) = 3.85 +/- 0.28 and 4.07 +/- 0.30, respectively, p = 0.022) and comparable performances for decoding arousal (MSE = 3.30 +/- 0.30 and 3.41 +/- 0.31, respectively, p = 0.169), as compared to conventional spectral power features. As microstate features describe neural activities from a global spatiotemporal dynamical perspective, our findings demonstrate a possible new mechanism for understanding human emotion and provide a promising type of EEG feature for affective computing.

This study investigates the feasibility of developing a hands- and eyes-free BCI system based on auditory and tactile attention. Users were presented with multiple simultaneous streams of auditory or tactile stimuli, and were directed to detect a pattern in one particular stream. We applied a linear classifier to decode the stream-tracking attention from the EEG signal. The results showed that the proposed BCI system could capture attention from most study participants using multisensory inputs, and showed potential in transfer learning across multiple sessions.

EEG Channel Interpolation Using Deep Encoder-decoder Networks	2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICINE	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine-BIBM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (IEEE BIBM)	DEC 16-19, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, Seoul Natl Univ, Bioinformat Inst, Korea Genome Open HRD, Korea Genome Organization, Bio Synergy Res Ctr, Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies, Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Stat, IEEE Tech Comm Computat Life Sci			SPHERICAL SPLINES	Electrode "pop" artifacts originate from the spontaneous loss of connectivity between a surface and an electrode. Electroencephalography (EEG) uses a dense array of electrodes, hence popped segments are among the most pervasive type of artifact seen during the collection of EEG data. In many cases, the continuity of EEG data is critical for downstream applications (e.g. brain machine interface) and requires that popped segments be accurately interpolated. In this paper we frame the interpolation problem as a self-learning task using a deep encoder-decoder network. We compare our approach against contemporary interpolation methods on a publicly available EEG data set. Our approach exhibited a minimum of similar to 15% improvement over contemporary approaches when tested on subjects and tasks not used during model training. We demonstrate how our model's performance can be enhanced further on novel subjects and tasks using transfer learning. All code and data associated with this study is open-source to enable ease of extension and practical use. To our knowledge, this work is the first solution to the EEG interpolation problem that uses deep learning.

This study proposes a methodology of constructing a novel mutual information-based feature set from the fusion of electroencephalography and vehicular signals acquired through a real driving experiment and deployed in evaluating drivers' mental workload. Mutual information of electroencephalography and vehicular signals were used as the prime factor for the fusion of features. In order to assess the reliability of the developed feature set mental workload score prediction, classification and event classification tasks were performed using different machine learning models. Moreover, features extracted from electroencephalography were used to compare the performance. In the prediction of mental workload score, expert-defined scores were used as the target values. For classification tasks, true labels were set from contextual information of the experiment. An extensive evaluation of every prediction tasks was carried out using different validation methods. In predicting the mental workload score from the proposed feature set lowest mean absolute error was 0.09 and for classifying mental workload highest accuracy was 94%. According to the outcome of the study, it can be stated that the novel mutual information based features developed through the proposed approach can be employed to classify and monitor in-vehicle drivers' mental workload.

Predicting stroke severity with a 3-min recording from the Muse portable EEG system for rapid diagnosis of stroke	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LARGE VESSEL OCCLUSION; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; QUANTITATIVE EEG; DELTA/ALPHA RATIO; PATTERNS	In this study, we demonstrated the use of low-cost portable electroencephalography (EEG) as a method for prehospital stroke diagnosis. We used a portable EEG system to record data from 25 participants, 16 had acute ischemic stroke events, and compared the results to age-matched controls that included stroke mimics. Delta/alpha ratio (DAR), (delta+theta)/(alpha+beta) ratio (DBATR) and pairwise-derived Brain Symmetry Index (pdBSI) were investigated, as well as head movement using the on-board accelerometer and gyroscope. We then used machine learning to distinguish between different subgroups. DAR and DBATR increased in ischemic stroke patients with increasing stroke severity (p=0.0021, partial eta (2)=0.293; p=0.01, partial eta (2)=0.234). Also, pdBSI decreased in low frequencies and increased in high frequencies in patients who had a stroke (p=0.036, partial eta (2)=0.177). Using classification trees, we were able to distinguish moderate to severe stroke patients and from minor stroke and controls, with a 63% sensitivity, 86% specificity and accuracy of 76%. There are significant differences in DAR, DBATR, and pdBSI between patients with ischemic stroke when compared to controls, and these effects scale with severity. We have shown the utility of a low-cost portable EEG system to aid in patient triage and diagnosis as an early detection tool.	[Wilkinson, Cassandra M.; Burrell, Jennifer I.; Kuziek, Jonathan W.

In this study, in view of the different MI tasks corresponding to active region of the EEG signals, we adopt a two-dimensional form including time, frequency, and electrode location information, then we design a classification method containing continuous small convolutional neural network (CSCNN). This method is mainly used for feature extraction through continuous small convolutional kernels and one rectangle convolutional kernel, and the softmax classifier for classification. In the experiment, classification accuracy and kappa value are used as evaluation criteria to verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this study. For classification accuracy, BCI competition IV data set 2b is used to compare with the other five classification methods (CNN, CNN-SAE, stacked autoencoder [SAE], support vector machine [SVM], and one-dimensional convolution combined with gated recurrent unit [1DCGRU]). The results demonstrate that the overall accuracy of CSCNN is higher than other methods, and CSCNN obtains an average accuracy of 82.8%. For kappa value, BCI competition IV data set 2b is used to compare with the other three methods (filter bank common spatial pattern [FBCSP], Twin SVM, and CNN-SAE). The performance of CSCNN is better with an average value of 0.663. Overall, the results show that CSCNN maintains a small number of parameters and improves the classification accuracy.

Method: The EEG signals are recorded for seven simple tasks using the designed data acquisition procedure. These seven tasks are conceivably used to control wheelchair movement and interact with others using any odd-ball paradigm. The proposed system records EEG signals from 10 individuals at eight-channel locations, during which the individual executes seven different mental tasks. The acquired brainwave patterns have been processed to eliminate noise, including artifacts and powerline noise, and are then partitioned into six different frequency bands. The proposed cross-correlation procedure then employs the segmented frequency bands from each channel to extract features. The cross-correlation procedure was used to obtain the coefficients in the frequency domain from consecutive frame samples. Then, the statistical measures ("minimum," "mean," "maximum," and "standard deviation") were derived from the cross-correlated signals. Finally, the extracted feature sets were validated through online sequential-extreme learning machine algorithm.

Pattern and Rule Mining for Identifying Signatures of Epileptic Patients from Clinical EEG Data	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						Epileptic signature; Epileptic Network; Feature Selection; Fuzzy Logic; EEGLAB	ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; FURIA	Epilepsy is a neurological condition of human being, mostly treated based on the patients' seizure symptoms, often recorded over multiple visits to a health-care facility. The lengthy time-consuming process of obtaining multiple recordings creates an obstacle in detecting epileptic patients in real time. An epileptic signature validated over EEG data of multiple similar kinds of epilepsy cases will haste the decision-making process of clinicians. In this paper, we have identified EEG data derived signatures for differentiating epileptic patients from normal individuals. Here we define the signatures with the help of various machine learning techniques, viz., feature selection and classification, pattern mining, and fuzzy rule mining These signatures will add confidence to the decision-making process for detecting epileptic patients. Moreover, we define separate signatures by incorporating few demographic features like gender and age. Such signatures may aid the clinicians with the generalized epileptic signature in case of complex decisions.

Multi-scale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA) is used for denoising EEG signals and the autoregressive (AR) algorithm will extract useful features from the EEG signal. The performances of the ensemble machine learning methods are measured with accuracy, F-measure, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). EEG-based focus area localization with the proposed methods reaches 98.9% accuracy using the Rotation Forest classifier. Therefore, our results suggest that ensemble machine learning methods can be applied to differentiate the EEG signals from epileptogenic brain areas and signals recorded from non-epileptogenic brain regions with high accuracy.

This, however, poses problems in the decoding of brain states for recognition and classification applications, particularly in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Recent BCI technologies are focused on the extraction of linear and nonlinear signal features. However, these systems do not necessarily capture the chaoticity of EEG signals, and hence, may affect the accuracy of classification. Furthermore, most recent EEG-based BCI systems involve nonlinear feature extraction; however, these systems require explicit and handselection of these features, and may therefore impose further errors. In this study, we investigate the use of deep learning techniques that involve inherent and embedded feature selection and extraction in their hidden layers, and hence, they do not require explicit and human-intervened selection of features. The performance of different deep learning models were compared to those of the traditional classifiers. Results show that deep learning-based BCI systems performed significantly better in comparison to the conventional classifiers. This BCI system can be extended in different applications, such as in recognition of imagined phonemes, words, phrases and sentences.

Using machine learning to reveal the population vector from EEG signals	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; arm movement; machine learning; population vector; movement direction; continuous movement; source imaging	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ARM MOVEMENTS; HAND MOVEMENTS; MOTOR; DIRECTION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; TRAJECTORIES; RESTORATION	Objective. Since the discovery of the population vector that directly relates neural spiking activity with arm movement direction, it has become feasible to control robotic arms and neuroprostheses using invasively recorded brain signals. For non-invasive approaches, a direct relation between human brain signals and arm movement direction is yet to be established. Approach. Here, we investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in temporal and spectral domains in a continuous, circular arm movement task. Using machine learning methods that respect the linear mixture of brain activity within EEG signals, we show that directional information is represented in the temporal domain in amplitude modulations of the same frequency as the arm movement, and in the spectral domain in power modulations of the 20-24 Hz frequency band. Main results. In the temporal domain, the directional information was mainly expressed in primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) contralateral to the moving arm, while in the spectral domain SM1 and PPC of both hemispheres predicted arm movement direction. The different cortical representations suggest distinct neural representations in both domains. Significance. This direct relation between neural activity and arm movement direction in both domains demonstrates the potential of machine learning to reveal neuroscientific insights about the dynamics of human arm movements.

The robot-assisted rehabilitation systems can be more prosperous if they are able to recognize the emotions of patients, and modify the difficulty level of task considering these emotions to increase patient's engagement. We aim to develop an emotion recognition model using electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological signals (blood volume pulse (BVP), skin temperature (ST) and skin conductance (SC)) for a robot-assisted rehabilitation system. The emotions are grouped into three categories, which are positive (pleasant), negative (unpleasant) or neutral. A machine-learning algorithm called Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and a deep learning algorithm called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to classify pleasant, unpleasant and neutral emotions from the recorded EEG and physiological signals. We ask the subjects to look at pleasant, unpleasant and neutral images from LAPS database and collect EEG and physiological signals during the experiments. The classification accuracies are compared for both GBM and CNN methods when only one sensory data (EEG, BVP, SC and ST) or the combination of the sensory data from both EEG and physiological signals are used.

In a longitudinal study multichannel data were collected: self-report data with questionnaires and embedded experience samples as well as sensor data like electrodermal activity (EDA) and electroencephalography (EEG). 100 students from a private university in Germany performed a learning experiment followed by final measures of intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy and gained knowledge. During the learning experiment psychophysiological data like EEG were combined with embedded experience sampling measuring motivational states like affect and interest every 270 s. Results of machine learning models show that consumer grade wearables for EEG and EDA failed to predict embedded experience sampling. EDA failed to predict outcome measures as well. This gap can be explained by some major technical difficulties, especially by lower quality of the electrodes. Nevertheless, an average activation of all EEG bands at T7 (left-hemispheric, lateral) can predict lower intrinsic motivation as outcome measure. This is in line with the personality system interactions (PSI) theory of Julius Kuhl. With more advanced sensor measures it might be possible to track affective learning in an unobtrusive way and support micro-adaptation in a digital learning environment.

It is very important to determine the faults in the bearings in terms of the machine health. In order to accurately diagnose bearing-related faults with traditional machine learning methods, it is necessary to identify the features that characterize bearing fault most accurately. Therefore, a new feature extraction procedure has been proposed to determine the vibration signal velocities of different fault sizes and types in this study. The new approach has been employed to obtain features from the vibration signals for different scenarios. After different filtering based on 1D-LBP method, the F-1D-LBP method was used to construct feature vectors. The filters reduce the noise in the signals and provide different feature groups. In other words, it is aimed to generate filters in order to extract different patterns that can separate signals. For each filter applied, different patterns can be obtained for the same local point on signals. Thus, the signals can be represented by different feature vectors. Then, by using these feature groups with various machine learning methods, vibration velocities were separated from each other. As a result, it was observed that the obtained feature had promising results for classification of bearing vibrations.

The electroencephalography (EEG) recording method is the most frequently used clinical practice in the diagnosis and monitoring of epilepsy. Many computer-aided analysis methods have been developed in the literature to facilitate the analysis of long-term EEG signals. In the proposed study, the patient-based seizure detection approach is proposed using a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation named Synchrosqueezed Transform (SST) method. The SST of two different data sets called the IKCU data set and CHB-MIT data set are obtained, and Higher-order joint TF (HOJ-TF) based and Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based features are calculated using these SSTs. Using some machine learning methods such as Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Logistic Regression (LR), classification processes are conducted. High patient-based seizure detection success is achieved for both the IKCU data set (94.25%) and the CHB-MIT data set (95.15%).

However, past studies have reported variable accuracies for detecting seizures using rm-EEG. We hypothesized that the past studies did not distinguish between differences in sensitivity from differences in classification of EEG patterns by different readers. The goal of the present study was to revisit the diagnostic value of rm-EEG when confounding issues are accounted for. Methods We retrospectively collected 212 adult EEGs recorded at Massachusetts General Hospital and reviewed by two epileptologists with access to clinical, trending, and video information. In Phase I of the study, we re-configured the first 4 h of the EEGs in lateral circumferential montage with ten electrodes and asked new readers to interpret the EEGs without access to any other ancillary information. We compared their rating to the reading of hospital clinicians with access to ancillary information. In Phase II, we measured the accuracy of the same raters reading representative samples of the discordant EEGs in full and reduced configurations presented randomly by comparing their performance to majority consensus as the gold standard. Results Of the 95 EEGs without seizures in the selected fm-EEG, readers of rm-EEG identified 92 cases (97%) as having no seizure activity. Of 117 EEGs with "seizures" identified in the selected fm-EEG, none of the cases was labeled as normal on rm-EEG. Readers of rm-EEG reported pathological activity in 100% of cases, but labeled them as seizures (N = 77), rhythmic or periodic patterns (N = 24), epileptiform spikes (N = 7), or burst suppression (N = 6). When the same raters read representative epochs of the discordant EEG cases (N = 43) in both fm-EEG and rm-EEG configurations, we found high concordance (95%) and intra-rater agreement (93%) between fm-EEG and rm-EEG diagnoses. Conclusions Reduced EEG with ten electrodes in circumferential configuration preserves key features of the traditional EEG system. Discrepancies between rm-EEG and fm-EEG as reported in some of the past studies can be in part due to methodological factors such as choice of gold standard diagnosis, asymmetric access to ancillary clinical information, and inter-rater variability rather than detection failure of rm-EEG as a result of electrode reduction per se.

However, little is known about the differences in the cortical activation between standing and sitting, especially how the brain's intention modulates the pre-movement sensorimotor rhythm as they do for switching movements. In this study, we aim to investigate the decoding of continuous EEG rhythms during action observation (AO), motor imagery (MI), and motor execution (ME) for the actions of standing and sitting. We developed a behavioral task in which participants were instructed to perform both AO and MI/ME in regard to the transitioning actions of sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit. Our results demonstrated that the ERD was prominent during AO, whereas ERS was typical during MI at the alpha band across the sensorimotor area. A combination of the filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and support vector machine (SVM) for classification was used for both offline and classifier testing analyses. The offline analysis indicated the classification of AO and MI providing the highest mean accuracy at 82.73 +/- 2.54% in the stand-to-sit transition. By applying the classifier testing analysis, we demonstrated the higher performance of decoding neural intentions from the MI paradigm in comparison to the ME paradigm. These observations led us to the promising aspect of using our developed tasks based on the integration of both AO and MI to build future exoskeleton-based rehabilitation systems.

Yet, few investigations have been paid to the preictal stage detection, which is practically more crucial to epileptics in taking precautions before seizure onset. In this article, a novel epileptic preictal state classification and seizure detection algorithm based on deep features learned by stacked convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) is developed. The mean amplitude of sub-band spectrum map (MAS) obtained from the average sub-band spectra of multichannel EEGs is adopted for representation. The probability feature vectors by stacked convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extracted in the softmax layer of CNNs, where an adaptive and discriminative feature weighting fusion (AWF) is developed for performance enhancement. Following the deep extraction layer, the effective kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is adopted for feature learning and epileptic classification. Experiments on the benchmark CHB-MIT database and a real recorded epileptic database are conducted for performance demonstration. Comparisons to many state-of-the-art epileptic classification methods are provided to show the superiority of the proposed SCNN+AWF algorithm.

J	Fu, RR; Han, MM; Tian, YS; Shi, PM				Fu, Rongrong; Han, Mengmeng; Tian, Yongsheng; Shi, Peiming			Improvement motor imagery EEG classification based on sparse common spatial pattern and regularized discriminant analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Common spatial pattern; Sparse; Linear discriminant analysis; Regularized	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; CHANNEL SELECTION; PERFORMANCE	Background: The classification of psychological tasks such as motor imagery based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an essential issue in the brain computer interface (BCI) system. The feature extraction is an important issue for improving classification accuracy of BCI system. New Method: For extracting discriminative features, common spatial pattern (CSP) is an effective feature extraction method. However, features extracted by CSP are dense, and even feature patterns are repeatedly selected in the feature space. A sparse CSP algorithm is proposed, which embeds the sparse techniques and iterative search into the CSP. To improve the classification performance, two regularization parameters are added to the traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Results: The sparse CSP algorithm can select several channels of EEG signals with the most obvious features. The improved regularized discriminant analysis is used to solve the singularity problem and improve the feature classification accuracy. Comparison with Existing Method(s): The proposed algorithm was evaluated by the data set I of the IVth BCI competition and our dataset. The experimental results of the BCI competition dataset show that accuracy of the improved algorithm is 10.75 % higher than that of the traditional algorithm. Comparing with the currently existing methods for the same data, it also shows excellent classification performance. The effectiveness of the improved algorithm is also shown in experiments on our dataset. Conclusions: It sufficiently proves that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper improves the classification performance of motor intent recognition.

Manual annotation of epileptic seizures is a time consuming process performed by expert neurologists. Hence, a procedure which automatically detects seizures would be hugely beneficial for a fast and cost-effective diagnosis. Recent progress in machine learning techniques, especially deep learning methods, coupled with the availability of large public EEG seizure databases provide new opportunities towards the design of automatic EEG-based seizure detection algorithms. We propose an epileptic seizure detection pipeline based on the fusion of multiple attention-gated U-nets, each operating on a different view of the EEG data. These different views correspond to distinct signal processing techniques applied on the raw EEG. The proposed model uses a long short term memory (LSTM) network for fusion of the individual attention-gated U-net outputs to detect seizures in EEG. The model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the TUH EEG seizure dataset and was awarded the first place in the Neureka (TM) 2020 Epilepsy Challenge.

These spectral features are fed as input to machine learning techniques to train the model and to predict the epileptic seizures. Machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear SVC, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Naive Bayes are explored for comparison and to validate the results.

Predicting specific movement features, such as speed and force, before movement execution may provide additional useful information at the expense of increasing the complexity of the decoding problem. Recent attempts to predict movement speed and force from the electroencephalogram (EEG) achieved classification accuracies at or slightly above chance levels, highlighting the need for more accurate prediction strategies. Thus, the aims of this study were to accurately predict hand movement speed and force from single-trial EEG signals and to decode neurophysiological information of motor preparation from the prediction strategies. To these ends, a decoding model based on convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) was implemented and compared against other state-of-the-art prediction strategies, such as support vector machines and decision trees. ConvNets outperformed the other prediction strategies, achieving an overall accuracy of 84% in the classification of two different levels of speed and force (four-class classification) from pre-movement single-trial EEG (100 ms and up to 1,600 ms prior to movement execution). Furthermore, an analysis of the ConvNet architectures suggests that the network performs a complex spatiotemporal integration of EEG data to optimize classification accuracy. These results show that movement speed and force can be accurately predicted from single-trial EEG, and that the prediction strategies may provide useful neurophysiological information about motor preparation.

J	Park, Y; Chung, W				Park, Yongkoo; Chung, Wonzoo			Optimal Channel Selection Using Correlation Coefficient for CSP Based EEG Classification	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Correlation; Task analysis; Feature extraction; Communications technology; Planning; Government; Electroencephalography (EEG); brain-computer interfaces (BCIs); correlation coefficient; common spatial pattern (CSP); channel selection	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPATIAL FILTERS; PERFORMANCE; BCI	In this paper, we present an optimal channel selection method to improve common spatial pattern (CSP) related features for motor imagery (MI) classification. In contrast to existing channel selection methods, in which channels significantly contributing to the classification in terms of the signal power are selected, distinctive channels in terms of correlation coefficient values are selected in the proposed method. The distinctiveness of a channel is quantified by the number of channels with which it yields large difference in correlation coefficient values for binary motor imagery (MI) tasks, rather than by the largeness of the difference itself. For each distinctive channel, a group of channels is formed by gathering strongly correlated channels and the Fisher score is computed using the feature output, based on the filter-bank CSP (FBCSP) exclusively applied to the channel group. Finally, the channel group with the highest Fisher score is chosen as the selected channels. The proposed method selects the fewest channels on average and outperforms existing channel selection approaches. The simulation results confirm performance improvement for two publicly available BCI datasets, BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition IV dataset I, in comparison with existing methods.

Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBSP) based methods of feature extraction for MI-classification has been shown very promising. In this paper we have advanced this frontier to present a new efficient approach whose variants out compete in accuracy (in terms of kappa values) with the existing approaches with the same or smaller feature set. We have demonstrated that use of one mu band and three beta sub-bands is very ideal both from the point-of-view of accuracy as well as computational complexity. We have been able to achieve the best reported kappa value of 0.67 for Dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV using our approach with a feature vector of length 64 directly composed out of FBCSP transformed data samples without the need of further feature selection. The feature vector of size 32 directly composed from FBCSP data is enough to outcompete existing approaches with regard to kappa value achievement. In this paper we also have systematically reported experiments with different classifiers including kNN, SVM, LDA, Ensemble, ANN and ANFIS and different lengths of feature vectors. SVM has been reported as the best classifier followed by the LDA.	[Khan, Gul Hameed; Hashmi, M.

We estimate the directed connectivity using relative wavelet transform entropy (RWTE) and partial directed coherence (PDC) and the graphical network measures by graph theory analysis (GTA) at four frequency bands. The RWTE and PDC quantify the strength and directionality of information flow between EEG nodes. On the other hand, the GTA of the complex network measures summarizes the topological structure of the network. We then evaluate the proposed methods using machine learning classifiers. We carried out an experiment on nine subjects performing semantic vigilance task (Stroop color word test (SCWT)) for approximately 45 minutes. Behaviorally, all subjects demonstrated vigilance decrement as reflected by the significant increase in response time and reduced accuracy. The strength and directionality of information flow in the connectivity network by RWTE/PDC and the GTA measures significantly decrease with vigilance decrement, p<0.05. The classification results show that the proposed methods outperform other related and competitive methods available in the literature and achieve 100% accuracy in subject-dependent and above 89% in subject-independent level in each of the four frequency bands. The overall results indicate that the proposed methods of directed connectivity patterns and GTA provide a complementary aspect of functional connectivity. Our study suggests directed functional connectivity with GTA as informative features and highlight Support Vector Machine as the suitable classifier for classifying semantic vigilance levels.

These mechanisms have implemented several tools for analyzing the cognitive workload, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been most frequently used due to their high precision. However, one of the main challenges in implementing the EEG signals is finding appropriate information for identifying cognitive states. Here, we present a new feature selection model for pattern recognition using information from EEG signals based on machine learning techniques called GALoRIS. GALoRIS combines Genetic Algorithms and Logistic Regression to create a new fitness function that identifies and selects the critical EEG features that contribute to recognizing high and low cognitive workloads and structures a new dataset capable of optimizing the model's predictive process. We found that GALoRIS identifies data related to high and low cognitive workloads of subjects while driving a vehicle using information extracted from multiple EEG signals, reducing the original dataset by more than 50% and maximizing the model's predictive capacity, achieving a precision rate greater than 90%.

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed as a feasible alternative to the diagnosis of several neurological diseases and disorders, such as AD. An ideal ML-derived diagnosis should be inexpensive and noninvasive while retaining the accuracy and versatility that make ML techniques desirable for medical applications. New Methods: Two portable modalities, Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been widely employed in constructing hybrid classification models to compensate for each other's weaknesses. In this study, we present a hybrid EEG-fNIRS model for classifying four classes of subjects including one healthy control (HC) group, one mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group, and, two AD patient groups. A concurrent EEG-fNIRS setup was used to record data from 29 subjects during a random digit encoding-retrieval task. EEG-derived and fNIRS-derived features were sorted using a Pearson correlation coefficient-based feature selection (PCCFS) strategy and then fed into a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier to evaluate their performance. Results: The hybrid EEG-fNIRS feature set was able to achieve a higher accuracy (79.31 %) by integrating their complementary properties, compared to using EEG (65.52 %) or fNIRS alone (58.62 %). Moreover, our results indicate that the right prefrontal and left parietal regions are associated with the progression of AD. Comparison with existing methods: Our hybrid and portable system provided enhanced classification performance in multi-class classification of AD population. Conclusions: These findings suggest that hybrid EEG-fNIRS systems are a promising tool that may enhance the AD diagnosis and assessment process.

Based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, a classification model was developed to identify whether a subject has a malicious intention under scenarios of being forced to become an insider threat. The model also distinguishes insider threat scenarios from everyday conflict scenarios. To support model development, 21-channel EEG signals were measured on 25 healthy subjects, and sets of features were extracted from the time, time-frequency, frequency and nonlinear domains. To select the best use of the available features, automatic selection was performed by random-forest-based algorithms. The k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine with radial kernel, naive Bayes, and multilayer perceptron algorithms were applied for the classification. By using EEG signals obtained while contemplating becoming an insider threat, the subject-wise model identified malicious intentions with 78.57% accuracy. The model also distinguished insider threat scenarios from everyday conflict scenarios with 93.47% accuracy. These findings could be utilized to support the development of insider threat mitigation systems along with existing trustworthiness assessments in the nuclear industry.

Such conventional marketing methods attempt to determine the attitude of the consumers toward a product, which may not represent the real behavior at the point of purchase. It is likely that the marketers misunderstand the consumer behavior because the predicted attitude does not always reflect the real purchasing behaviors of the consumers. This research study was aimed at bridging the gap between traditional market research, which relies on explicit consumer responses, and neuromarketing research, which reflects the implicit consumer responses. The EEG-based preference recognition in neuromarketing was extensively reviewed. Another gap in neuromarketing research is the lack of extensive data-mining approaches for the prediction and classification of the consumer preferences. Therefore, in this work, a deep-learning approach is adopted to detect the consumer preferences by using EEG signals from the DEAP dataset by considering the power spectral density and valence features. The results demonstrated that, although the proposed deep-learning exhibits a higher accuracy, recall, and precision compared with the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine algorithms, random forest reaches similar results to deep learning on the same dataset.

We investigate two deep transfer learning strategies for overcoming the channel mismatch problem for cases where two datasets do not contain exactly the same setup leading to degraded performance in single-EEG models. Specifically, we train a baseline model on multivariate polysomnography data and subsequently replace the first two layers to prepare the architecture for single-channel electroencephalography data. Using a fine-tuning strategy, our model yields similar performance to the baseline model (F1=0.682 and F1=0.694, respectively), and was significantly better than a comparable single-channel model. Our results are promising for researchers working with small databases who wish to use deep learning models pre-trained on larger databases.	[Olesen, Alexander Neergaard; Sorensen, Helge B.

Continuous low-frequency EEG decoding of arm movement for closed-loop, natural control of a robotic arm	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; brain-computer interface; online decoding; closed-loop control; motor control; kinematics	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; CORTICAL REPRESENTATIONS; PARIETAL CORTEX; SIGNALS; DIRECTION; MEG; TRAJECTORIES; VELOCITY; TETRAPLEGIA; NEURONS	Objective.Continuous decoding of voluntary movement is desirable for closed-loop, natural control of neuroprostheses. Recent studies showed the possibility to reconstruct the hand trajectories from low-frequency (LF) electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. So far this has only been performed offline. Here, we attempt for the first time continuous online control of a robotic arm with LF-EEG-based decoded movements.Approach. The study involved ten healthy participants, asked to track a moving target by controlling a robotic arm. At the beginning of the experiment, the robot was fully controlled by the participant's hand trajectories. After calibrating the decoding model, that control was gradually replaced by LF-EEG-based decoded trajectories, first with 33%, 66% and finally 100% EEG control. Likewise with other offline studies, we regressed the movement parameters (two-dimensionalpositions, velocities, andaccelerations) from the EEG with partial least squares (PLS) regression. To integrate the information from the different movement parameters, we introduced a combined PLS and Kalman filtering approach (named PLSKF).Main results.We obtained moderate yet overall significant (alpha= 0.05) online correlations between hand kinematics and PLSKF-decoded trajectories of 0.32 on average. With respect to PLS regression alone, the PLSKF had a stable correlation increase of Delta r= 0.049 on average, demonstrating the successful integration of different models. Parieto-occipital activations were highlighted for thevelocityandaccelerationdecoder patterns. The level of robot control was above chance in all conditions. Participants finally reported to feel enough control to be able to improve with training, even in the 100% EEG condition.Significance.Continuous LF-EEG-based movement decoding for the online control of a robotic arm was achieved for the first time.

J	Lindig-Leon, C; Rimbert, S; Bougrain, L				Lindig-Leon, Cecilia; Rimbert, Sebastien; Bougrain, Laurent			Multiclass Classification Based on Combined Motor Imageries	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); combined motor imageries; multilabel classification; common spatial pattern (CSP); electroencephalography (EEG)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS; ALPHA-BAND; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; NETWORK; RHYTHMS; SIGNAL	Motor imagery (MI) allows the design of self-paced brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which can potentially afford an intuitive and continuous interaction. However, the implementation of non-invasive MI-based BCIs with more than three commands is still a difficult task. First, the number of MIs for decoding different actions is limited by the constraint of maintaining an adequate spacing among the corresponding sources, since the electroencephalography (EEG) activity from near regions may add up. Second, EEG generates a rather noisy image of brain activity, which results in a poor classification performance. Here, we propose a solution to address the limitation of identifiable motor activities by using combined MIs (i.e., MIs involving 2 or more body parts at the same time). And we propose two new multilabel uses of the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, namely MC2CMI and MC2SMI approaches. We recorded EEG signals from seven healthy subjects during an 8-class EEG experiment including the rest condition and all possible combinations using the left hand, right hand, and feet. The proposed multilabel approaches convert the original 8-class problem into a set of three binary problems to facilitate the use of the CSP algorithm. In the case of the MC2CMI method, each binary problem groups together in one class all the MIs engaging one of the three selected body parts, while the rest of MIs that do not engage the same body part are grouped together in the second class. In this way, for each binary problem, the CSP algorithm produces features to determine if the specific body part is engaged in the task or not. Finally, three sets of features are merged together to predict the user intention by applying an 8-class linear discriminant analysis. The MC2SMI method is quite similar, the only difference is that any of the combined MIs is considered during the training phase, which drastically accelerates the calibration time. For all subjects, both the MC2CMI and the MC2SMI approaches reached a higher accuracy than the classic pair-wise (PW) and one-vs.-all (OVA) methods. Our results show that, when brain activity is properly modulated, multilabel approaches represent a very interesting solution to increase the number of commands, and thus to provide a better interaction.

The study included 23 unmedicated ADHD patients and 23 healthy controls. The EEG signal was analyzed in time domain by nonlinear brain dynamics and morphological features, and in time-frequency domain with wavelet coefficients. Selected features were applied to various machine learning techniques including; Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, k-nearest neighbor, Adaptive Boosting, Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify ADHD patients and healthy controls. Longer P300 latencies and smaller P300 amplitudes were observed in ADHD patients relative to controls. In fractal dimension calculation relative to the control group, the ADHD group demonstrated reduced complexity. In addition, certain wavelet coefficients provided significantly different values in both groups. Combining these extracted features, our results indicated that Multilayer Perceptron method provided the best classification with an accuracy rate of 91.3% and a high level of reliability of concurrence (Kappa = 0.82). The results showed that combining time and frequency domain features can be a useful and discriminative for diagnostic purposes in ADHD. The study presents a supporting diagnostic tool that uses EEG signal processing and machine learning algorithms. The findings would be helpful in the objective diagnosis of ADHD.

Classification of EEG Signals Based on Image Representation of Statistical Features	ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS (UKCI 2019)	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	19th Annual UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence (UKCI)	SEP 04-06, 2019	Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, ENGLAND		Univ Portsmouth	Machine learning; Convolutional neural networks; Image recognition; Mental state classification; Electroencephalography		This work presents an image classification approach to EEG brainwave classification. The proposed method is based on the representation of temporal and statistical features as a 2D image, which is then classified using a deep Convolutional Neural Network. A three-class mental state problem is investigated, in which subjects experience either relaxation, concentration, or neutral states. Using publicly available EEG data from a Muse Electroencephalography headband, a large number of features describing the wave are extracted, and subsequently reduced to 256 based on the Information Gain measure. These 256 features are then normalised and reshaped into a 16 x 16 grid, which can be expressed as a grayscale image. A deep Convolutional Neural Network is then trained on this data in order to classify the mental state of subjects. The proposed method obtained an out-of-sample classification accuracy of 89.38%, which is competitive with the 87.16% of the current best method from a previous work.

Neurophysiologists will find the work useful in the timely and accurate detection of epileptic seizures of their patients. We explored the best way to detect meaningful patterns from an epileptic Electroencephalogram (EEG). Signals used in this work are 23.6 s segments of 100 single channel surface EEG recordings collected with the sampling rate of 173.61 Hz. The recorded signals are from five healthy volunteers with eyes closed and eyes open, and intracranial EEG recordings from five epilepsy patients during the seizure-free interval as well as epileptic seizures. Feature engineering was done using; i) feature extraction of each EEG wave in time, frequency and time-frequency domains via Butterworth filter, Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform respectively and, ii) feature selection with T-test, and Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS). SVM and KNN learning algorithms were applied to classify preprocessed EEG signal. Performance comparison was based on Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity. Our experiments showed that SVM has a slight edge over KNN.

The hBCI system also showed promising prospects for patients because the design of a human-centered smart robot control system may allow the performance of multiple tasks with high efficiency. In this paper, we present a hybrid multicontrol system that simultaneously uses electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. After the preprocessing phase, we used a common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm to extract EEG and EOG features from motor imagery and eye movements. Moreover, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to solve a multiclass problem and complete flight operations through the asynchronous hBCI control of a four-axis quadcopter (e.g., takeoff, forward, backward, rightward, leftward, and landing). Online decoding of experimental results showed that 97.14, 95.23, 98.09, and 96.66% average accuracies, and 45.80, 43.99, 46.78, and 45.34 bits/min average ITRs were achieved in the control of a quadcopter. These online experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid system might be better in terms of completing multidirection control tasks to increase the multitasking and dimensionality of a BCI.

Mandarin is a tonal language, and its tones play an important role in language perception and semantic understanding. This work studied the electroencephalogram (EEG) based classification of Mandarin tones based on speech imagery, and also compared the classification performance of speech imagery based BCIs at two test conditions with visual-only and combined audio-visual stimuli, respectively. Participants imagined 4 Mandarin tones at each condition. Common spatial patterns were applied to extract feature vectors, and support vector machine was used to classify different Mandarin tones from EEG data. Experimental results showed that the tonal articulation imagination task achieved a higher classification accuracy at the combined audio-visual condition (i.e., 80.1%) than at the visual-only condition (i.e., 67.7%). The results in this work supported that Mandarin tone information could be decoded from EEG data recorded in a speech imagery task, particularly under the combined audio-visual condition.

Enhanced Multiple Instance Representation Using Time-Frequency Atoms in Motor Imagery Classification	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor imagery; LASSO regularization; CSP; multiple-instance learning; dynamic brain behavior	PATTERNS; WORDS	Selection of the time-window mainly affects the effectiveness of piecewise feature extraction procedures. We present an enhanced bag-of-patterns representation that allows capturing the higher-level structures of brain dynamics within a wide window range. So, we introduce augmented instance representations with extended window lengths for the short-time Common Spatial Pattern algorithm. Based on multiple-instance learning, the relevant bag-of-patterns are selected by a sparse regression to feed a bag classifier. The proposed higher-level structure representation promotes two contributions: (i) accuracy improvement of bi-conditional tasks, (ii) A better understanding of dynamic brain behavior through the learned sparse regression fits. Using a support vector machine classifier, the achieved performance on a public motor imagery dataset (left-hand and right-hand tasks) shows that the proposed framework performs very competitive results, providing robustness to the time variation of electroencephalography recordings and favoring the class separability.

However, previous studies of SSVEP-based BCIs give contradictory results on which stimulation medium provides the best performance. This paper describes a comparison of electroencephalography (EEG) decoding accuracy between using an LCD screen, clear LEDs, and frosted LEDs to deliver flashing light stimulation. The LCD screen and frosted LEDs achieved similar mean accuracies, and both of them were significantly better than clear LEDs. Background contrast with the LEDs did not significantly influence SSVEP decoding accuracy. A strong correlation was found between SSVEP accuracy and frequency domain magnitudes of EEG measurements.

Fourier Spectral Domain Functional Principal Component Analysis of EEG Signals	PATTERN RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS AND METHODS (ICPRAM 2019)	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods (ICPRAM)	FEB 19-21, 2019	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC			Fourier power spectrum; Functional principal component analysis EEG; Epilepsy diagnosis	HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA; SEIZURE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) is a natural tool for investigating the functional pattern of functional data. Clustering functional data using FPCA can be an important area in machine learning for signal processing, in particular, for signals that contain a deterministic component. Also, FPCA can be useful for analysis of random signals if an appropriate transformation is applied. In this work, we propose a novel approach by extracting key features of EEG signals in the Fourier spectral domain using FPCA. By first transforming EEG signals into their Fourier power spectra, the functionality of signals is greatly enhanced. Due to this improvement, the application of FPCA becomes much more meaningful in signal feature extraction. Our study shows a great potential of using spectral domain FPCA as a feature extractor for processing EEG signals in both epilepsy diagnosis and epileptic seizure detection.

Automatic detection and classification of EEG artifacts using fuzzy kernel SVM and wavelet ICA (WICA)	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Wavelet ICA (WICA); Fuzzy kernel support vector machine (FKSVM); Aircraft; ECG signal	REMOVAL; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAMS; POTENTIALS; EXTRACTION	Electroencephalography (EEG) is almost contaminated with many artifacts while recording the brain signal activity. Clinical diagnostic and brain computer interface applications frequently require the automated removal of artifacts. In digital signal processing and visual assessment, EEG artifact removal is considered to be the key analysis technique. Nowadays, a standard method of dimensionality reduction technique like independent component analysis (ICA) and wavelet transform combination can be explored for removing the EEG signal artifacts. Manual artifact removal is time-consuming; in order to avoid this, a novel method of wavelet ICA (WICA) using fuzzy kernel support vector machine (FKSVM) is proposed for removing and classifying the EEG artifacts automatically. Proposed method presents an efficient and robust system to adopt the robotic classification and artifact computation from EEG signal without explicitly providing the cutoff value. Furthermore, the target artifacts are removed successfully in combination with WICA and FKSVM. Additionally, proposes the various descriptive statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, variance, kurtosis and range provides the model creation technique in which the training and testing the data of FKSVM is used to classify the EEG signal artifacts. The future work to implement various machine learning algorithm to improve performance of the system.	[Yasoda, K.] SNS Coll Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Ponmagal, R.

Signals from the central and peripheral nervous systems have been used for emotion recognition purposes, however, their operation and the relationship between them remains unknown. In this context, in the present work, we have tried to approach the study of the psychobiology of both systems in order to generate a computational model for the recognition of emotions in the dimension of valence. To this end, the electroencephalography (EEG) signal, electrocardiography (ECG) signal and skin temperature of 24 subjects have been studied. Each methodology has been evaluated individually, finding characteristic patterns of positive and negative emotions in each of them. After feature selection of each methodology, the results of the classification showed that, although the classification of emotions is possible at both central and peripheral levels, the multimodal approach did not improve the results obtained through the EEG alone. In addition, differences have been observed between cerebral and peripheral responses in the processing of emotions by separating the sample by sex; though, the differences between men and women were only notable at the peripheral nervous system level.

This mini-review summarised aEEG studies on children aged one month to 18 years, evaluated the usefulness of aEEG and identified knowledge gaps or limitations. Methods We searched the PubMed database for articles published in English up to September 2020, and 23 papers were identified. Results aEEG was frequently used to compensate for the absence of continuous full-channel EEG monitoring, particularly for detecting seizures. Interpreting background patterns was based on neonatal classifications, as reference values for older infants and children are lacking. It is possible that aEEG could predict outcomes after paediatric cardiac arrests and other conditions. Gaps in our knowledge exist with regard to normal values in healthy children and the effects of sedation on aEEG background patterns in children. Conclusion The main application of aEEG was detecting and treating paediatric seizures. Further research should determine reference values and investigate the potential to predict outcome after critical events or in acute neurological disease. It is likely that aEEG will play a role in paediatric critical care in the future.

In this regard, a salient issue is the identification of brain activity patterns that can be used to classify intention. Using Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals as archetypical, this classification problem generally possesses two stages: (i) extracting features from collected EEG waveforms; and (ii) constructing a classifier using extracted features. With the advent of deep learning, however, the former stage is generally absorbed into the latter. Nevertheless, the burden has now shifted from trying a number of feature extraction methods to tuning a large number of hyperparameters and architectures. Among existing deep learning architectures used in BCI, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become an attractive choice. Most of the existing studies that use these networks are based on well-known architectures such as AlexNet or ResNet, use the domain knowledge to construct the final architecture or have an unclear strategy deployed for model selection. This raises the question as to whether constructing accurate CNN-based classifiers is possible using a principled model selection, with the most straightforward one being the brute-force search or, alternatively, experience and developing high intuition regarding hyperparameters combined with an ad hoc approach is the most prudent way to go about designing them. To this end, in this paper, we first define a space of hyperparameters restricted by our computing power. Then we show that an exhaustive search within this limited space of CNN hyperparameters leads to accurate classification of sensorimotor rhythms that arise during motor imagery tasks.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of MLT's trained with EEG data to classify developers' code comprehension. Brainwave data collected from an EEG device while developers performed source code comprehension tasks was used to train the Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Random Forrest classifiers. The effectiveness of these techniques was analyzed using accuracy, precision and recall. The Neural Network classifier, trained with EEG data and Principal Component Analysis, obtained 84% accuracy to classify code comprehension. Thus, the application of MLT to classify developers' code comprehension based on EEG data is possible.

The nature of this contradiction makes EEG signal reconstruction with high sampling rates and sensitivity challenging. Conventional reconstruction algorithms lead to loss of the representative details of brain activity and suffer from remaining artifacts because such algorithms only aim to minimize the temporal mean-squared-error (MSE) under generic penalties. Instead of using temporal MSE according to conventional mathematical models, this paper introduces a novel reconstruction algorithm based on generative adversarial networks with the Wasserstein distance (WGAN) and a temporal-spatial-frequency (TSF-MSE) loss function. The carefully designed TSF-MSE-based loss function reconstructs signals by computing the MSE from time-series features, common spatial pattern features, and power spectral density features. Promising reconstruction and classification results are obtained from three motor-related EEG signal datasets with different sampling rates and sensitivities. Our proposed method significantly improves classification performances of EEG signals reconstructions with the same sensitivity and the average classification accuracy improvements of EEG signals reconstruction with different sensitivities. By introducing the WGAN reconstruction model with TSF-MSE loss function, the proposed method is beneficial for the requirements of high classification performance and low cost and is convenient for the design of high-performance brain computer interface systems.

In this study, we aim at a patient-specific model for predicting the risk of seizure paroxysm by extracting the in-depth features from continuous scalp electroencephalographic(EEG) signals. Unfortunately, the false warning rates of generalized regression prediction algorithms are relatively high on account of the complexity of the cerebral time series. Hence we set the seizure forecast problem as a time series classification(TSC) problem and a cutting-edge TSC algorithm:the Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles(HIVE-COTE) is introduced to address the issue at the first time. In addition, we improve the structure of HIVE-COTE using a channel selection module. With the improved HIVE-COTE model, an oncoming seizure could be detected by a collective of machine-learning classifiers that identify the accurate pattern(inter-ictal or pre-ictal) of the cerebral signals.

Despite the progress in the analysis of pattern recognition based devices; the acceptance of these devices is still questionable. One reason is the lack of information to identify the possible combinations of features and classifiers. Besides; there is also a need for optimal selection of various sensors for sensations such as touch, force, texture, along with EMGs/EEGs. This article reviews the two bio-signal techniques, named as electromyography and electroencephalography. The details of the features and the classifiers used in the data processing for upper limb assist devices are summarised here. Various features and their sets are surveyed and different classifiers for feature sets are discussed on the basis of the classification rate. The review was carried out on the basis of the last 10-12 years of published research in this area. This article also outlines the influence of modality of EMGs and EEGs with other sensors on classifications. Also, other bio-signals used in upper limb devices and future aspects are considered.

BCI systems based on Motor Imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) signals enable the user to convert their thoughts into actions without any voluntary muscle movement. Recently, Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for the classification of MI signals. However, to produce good MI classification, it is necessary to effectively represent the signal as an input image to the CNN and train the deep learning classifier using large training data. Methods In this work, EEG signals are acquired over 16 channels and are filtered using a bandpass filter with the frequency range of 1 to 100 Hz. The processed signal is spatially filtered using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filter. The spectrograms of the spatially filtered signals are given as input to CNN. A single convolutional layer CNN is designed to classify left hand, right hand, both hands, and feet MI EEG signals. The size of the training data is increased by augmenting the spectrograms of the EEG signals. Results The CNN classifier was evaluated using MI signals acquired from twelve healthy subjects. Results show that the proposed method achieved an average classification accuracy of 95.18 +/- 2.51% for two-class (left hand and right hand) and 87.37 +/- 1.68% for four-class (Left hand, Right hand, Both hands, and Feet) MI. Conclusion Thus, the method manifests that this 2D representation of 1D EEG signal along with image augmentation shows a high potential for classification of MI EEG signals using the designed CNN model.

The current study aimed to explore a new method for discriminating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and control group by means of simultaneous measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-three pre-medicated combined type ADHD children and 21 healthy children were included in the study. Nonlinear brain dynamics of subjects were obtained from EEG signal using Higuchi fractal dimensions and Lempel-Ziv complexity, latency and amplitude values of P3 wave obtained from auditory evoked potentials and frontal cortex hemodynamic responses calculated from fNIRS. Lower complexity values, prolonged P3 latency and reduced P3 amplitude values were found in ADHD children. fNIRS indicated that the control subjects exhibited higher right prefrontal activation than ADHD children. Features are analyzed, looking for the best classification accuracy and finally machine learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perception Neural Network, are introduced for EEG signals alone and for combination of fNIRS and EEG signals. Naive Bayes provided the best classification with an accuracy rate of 79.54% and 93.18%, using EEG and EEG-fNIRS systems, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that utilization of information by combining features obtained from fNIRS and EEG improves the classification accuracy. As a conclusion, our method has indicated that EEG-fNIRS multimodal neuroimaging is a promising method for ADHD objective diagnosis.

The demand for BCI-based applications is growing tremendously, and efforts are in progress to deploy BCI devices for real-world applications. One of the widely known applications of BCI technology is rehabilitation in which BCI devices can provide various types of assistance to specially abled persons. In this paper, the effect of hand actions on objects is analyzed for motor-related mental task. The proposed approach analyzes electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain activity which was captured for images shown with different gripping actions on objects. The EEG recordings are first pre-processed, followed by extraction of epochs and frequency bands using discrete wavelet transform; afterward, feature extraction followed by training and classification steps is performed for classifying the grip action into congruent (correct) and incongruent (incorrect) grip categories. The proposed work makes use of average power and relative wavelet energy as discriminating features which are then fed to train an artificial neural network for automatically classifying the incoming EEG patterns into correct or incorrect object hand grips. The performance evaluation of the proposed system is done on real EEG dataset obtained from 14 subjects. Experimental results have shown an accuracy of 75%. Also, to evaluate the effectiveness of our work, a comparison of our work with other state-of-the-art works reported by different authors is presented at the end. The results show the effectiveness of proposed approach and suggest further that the system can be used to analyze and train subjects having motor-related disabilities for perceiving correct or incorrect hand grips on objects.

Moreover, due to the non-stationarities in EEG signals, the offline training model has poor adaptability and classification ability in cross-session or sample-wise online testing. Methods: To address the problems, we propose a model updating scheme with adaptive and fast operation. Based on the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), we propose an online and fast generalized eigendecomposition method by Recursive Least Squares updates of the CSP filter coefficients (RLS-CSP), which allows incremental training for CSP spatial filters. Additionally, we present an Incremental Self-training Classification algorithm based on Density Clustering (ISCDC) to select high-confidence samples to update spatial filters and classifier, and classify at the same time. Results: We conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficiency of the proposed adaptive CSP and classifier on the BCI III_IVa and BCI III_V data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLS-CSP outperforms significantly in a small sample setting (SSS), and ISCDC has great adaptability in cross-session and non-stationary EEG signals. The results indicate that our proposed methods are feasible to improve the real-time performance of online BCI system.

Advancing manipulation and control technology of external devices such as robotics, the need of MI for complex and human-like movements is growing. The two most important procedures that influence the performance of MI-BCI are feature extraction and classification. Although there have been recent studies on feature extraction for complex, there is no consensus on the classifier suitable for complex MI. This study aimed to identify the best classifier for complex MI decoding. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings measured during complex MI, which are hand grasping, spreading, pronation and supination, were used for binary (grasp vs. twist) and quaternary classification. Time domain parameter, which have shown suitability for complex movement decoding in previous works, was used as the EEG feature. Four types of ten machine learning classifiers, which have been applied to MI-BCI, were compared. Shrinkage regularized linear discriminant analysis (SRLDA) exhibited the best classification accuracy in both binary (92.8%) and quaternary (55.2%). In the case of training and testing time, a small amount of time for real-time analysis were needed, except random forest and logistic regression. This study showed that SRLDA is an appropriate classifier for complex MI classification, due to its ability to handle stationary and high dimensionality feature, TDP. The findings suggest that complex MI-BCI could gain more benefit from applying linear and shrinkage regularized model (i.e., SRLDA).

However, the electroencephalography signals are distorted by movement artifacts and electromyography signals in ambulatory condition, which make hard to recognize human intention. In addition, as hardware issues are also challenging, ear-EEG has been developed for practical brain-computer interface and is widely used. However, ear-EEG still contains contaminated signals. In this paper, we proposed robust two-stream deep neural networks in walking conditions and analyzed the visual response EEG signals in the scalp and ear in terms of statistical analysis and brain-computer interface performance. We validated the signals with the visual response paradigm, steady- state visual evoked potential. The brain-computer interface performance deteriorated as 3 similar to 14% when walking fast at 1.6 m/s. When applying the proposed method, the accuracies increase 15% in cap-EEG and 7% in ear-EEG. The proposed method shows robust to the ambulatory condition in session dependent and session-to-session experiments.

To date, it appears that none have been explored as a way of distinguishing between migraine patients with aura (MWA) vs. those without aura (MWoA). In this work, we apply a mixture of predictive, e.g., classification methods and attribute-selection techniques, and traditional explanatory, e.g., statistical, analyses on functional connectivity measures extracted from EEG signal acquired from at-rest participants (N = 52) during their interictal period and tested them against the distinction between MWA and MWoA. We show that a functional connectivity metric of EEG data obtained during resting state can serve as a sole biomarker to differentiate between MWA and MWoA. Using the proposed analysis, we not only have been able to present high classification results (average classification of 84.62%) but also to discuss the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms upon which our technique is based. Additionally, a more traditional statistical analysis on the selected features reveals that MWoA patients show higher than average connectivity in the Theta band (p = 0.03) at rest than MWAs. We propose that our data-driven analysis pipeline can be used for resting-EEG analysis in any clinical context.

Hearables: Automatic Overnight Sleep Monitoring With Standardized In-Ear EEG Sensor	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Sleep; Monitoring; Biomedical monitoring; Electroencephalography; Ear; Sensors; Standards; Automatic sleep staging; ear-EEG; electroencephalography (EEG); structural complexity analysis; wearable EEG	AMERICAN ACADEMY; ACTIGRAPHY; COMPLEX; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABILITY; VALIDATION; DISORDERS; MEDICINE; ENTROPY; NIGHTS	Objective: Advances in sensor miniaturization and computational power have served as enabling technologies for monitoring human physiological conditions in real-world scenarios. Sleep disruption may impact neural function, and can be a symptom of both physical and mental disorders. This study proposes wearable in-ear electroencephalography (ear-EEG) for overnight sleep monitoring as a 24/7 continuous and unobtrusive technology for sleep quality assessment in the community. Methods: A total of 22 healthy participants took part in overnight sleep monitoring with simultaneous ear-EEG and conventional full polysomnography recordings. The ear-EEG data were analyzed in the both structural complexity and spectral domains. The extracted features were used for automatic sleep stage prediction through supervized machine learning, whereby the PSG data were manually scored by a sleep clinician. Results: The agreement between automatic sleep stage prediction based on ear-EEG from a single in-ear sensor and the hypnogram based on the full PSG was 74.1% in the accuracy over five sleep stage classification. This is supported by a substantial agreement in the kappa metric (0.61). Conclusion: The in-ear sensor is feasible for monitoring overnight sleep outside the sleep laboratory and also mitigates technical difficulties associated with PSG. It, therefore, represents a 24/7 continuously wearable alternative to conventional cumbersome and expensive sleep monitoring. Significance: The "standardized" one-size-fits-all viscoelastic in-ear sensor is a next generation solution to monitor sleep-this technology promises to be a viable method for readily wearable sleep monitoring in the community, a key to affordable healthcare and future eHealth.

In particular, non-invasive technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG) or near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have been used to detect motor imagery, disease, or mental state. It has been already shown in literature that the hybrid of EEG and NIRS has better results than their respective individual signals. The fusion algorithm for EEG and NIRS sources is the key to implement them in real-life applications. In this research, we propose three fusion methods for the hybrid of the EEG and NIRS-based brain-computer interface system: linear fusion, tensor fusion, and $p$ th-order polynomial fusion. Firstly, our results prove that the hybrid BCI system is more accurate, as expected. Secondly, the $p$ th-order polynomial fusion has the best classification results out of the three methods, and also shows improvements compared with previous studies. For a motion imagery task and a mental arithmetic task, the best detection accuracy in previous papers were 74.20 & x0025; and 88.1 & x0025;, whereas our accuracy achieved was 77.53 & x0025; and 90.19 & x0025;. Furthermore, unlike complex artificial neural network methods, our proposed methods are not as computationally demanding.

Various EEG features have been employed for the implementation of pBCI applications; however, it is frequently reported that some individuals have difficulty fully enjoying the pBCI applications because the dynamic ranges of their EEG features (i.e., its amplitude variability over time) were too small to be used in the practical applications. Conducting preliminary experiments to search for the individualized EEG features associated with different mental states can partly circumvent this issue; however, these time-consuming experiments were not necessary for the majority of users whose dynamic ranges of EEG features are large enough to be used for pBCI applications. In this study, we tried to predict an individual user's dynamic ranges of the EEG features that are most widely employed for pBCI applications from resting-state EEG (RS-EEG), with the ultimate goal of identifying individuals who might need additional calibration to become suitable for the pBCI applications. We employed a machine learning-based regression model to predict the dynamic ranges of three widely used EEG features known to be associated with the brain states of valence, relaxation, and concentration. Our results showed that the dynamic ranges of EEG features could be predicted with normalized root mean squared errors of 0.2323, 0.1820, and 0.1562, respectively, demonstrating the possibility of predicting the dynamic ranges of the EEG features for pBCI applications using short resting EEG data.

The performance of popular machine learning algorithm usually rely on the number of labeled training samples, such as the deep learning approaches,sparse classification approaches and supervised learning approaches. However, the labeled samples are very difficulty to get for electroencephalography(EEG) data. In addition, most deep learning algorithms are usually time-consuming in the process of training. Considering these problems, in this article, a novel semi-supervised quantization algorithm based on the cartesian K-means algorithm is proposed, which named it as the semi-supervised cartesian K-means (SSCK), we use the CNN models pre-trained on motor imagery samples to create deep features, and then we applied it for motor imagery (MI) data classification. Unlike the traditional semi-supervised learning models that labeled information can be directly casted into the model training, label information can only be implicitly used in the semi-supervised learning strategy, in the semi-supervised learning algorithm, supervised information is integrated into the quantization algorithm by resorting a supervised constructed laplacian regularizer. Experimental results over four popular EEG datasets substantiate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed semi-supervised cartesian K-means. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the effect of stimulus modality on EEG patterns within this process is less understood. To fill this research gap, the present study re-analyzed EEG datasets recorded during visual and audiovisual equivalence learning tasks from earlier studies. The number of associations required to be maintained (WM load) in WM was increased using the staircase method during the acquisition phase of the tasks. The support vector machine algorithm was employed to predict WM load and stimulus modality using the power, phase connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) values obtained during time segments with different WM loads in the visual and audiovisual tasks. A high accuracy (>90%) in predicting stimulus modality based on power spectral density and from the theta-beta CFC was observed. However, accuracy in predicting WM load was higher (>= 75% accuracy) than that in predicting stimulus modality (which was at chance level) using theta and alpha phase connectivity. Under low WM load conditions, this connectivity was highest between the frontal and parieto-occipital channels. The results validated our findings from earlier studies that dissociated stimulus modality based on power-spectra and CFC during equivalence learning. Furthermore, the results emphasized the importance of alpha and theta frontoparietal connectivity in WM load.

As the microscopic details of individuals' brains are directly shaped by their rich experiences, musicians can develop certain neurological characteristics, such as improved brain plasticity, following extensive musical training. Specifically, the advanced bimanual motor coordination that pianists exhibit means that they may interact more effectively with BCI systems than their non-musically trained counterparts; this could lead to personalized BCI strategies according to the users' previously detected skills. This work assessed the performance of pianists as they interacted with an MI-based BCI system and compared it with that of a control group. The Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) machine learning algorithms were applied to the EEG signals for feature extraction and classification, respectively. The results revealed that the pianists achieved a higher level of BCI control by means of MI during the final trial (74.69%) compared to the control group (63.13%). The outcome indicates that musical training could enhance the performance of individuals using BCI systems.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is closely related to the central nervous system activity of the brain. Compared with other signals, EEG is more closely associated with the emotional activity. It is essential to study emotion recognition based on EEG information. In the research of emotion recognition based on EEG, it is a common problem that the results of individual emotion classification vary greatly under the same scheme of emotion recognition, which affects the engineering application of emotion recognition. In order to improve the overall emotion recognition rate of the emotion classification system, we propose the CSP_VAR_CNN (CVC) emotion recognition system, which is based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to classify emotions of EEG signals. Firstly, the emotion recognition system using common spatial patterns (CSP) to reduce the EEG data, then the standardized variance (VAR) is selected as the parameter to form the emotion feature vectors. Lastly, a 5-layer CNN model is built to classify the EEG signal. The classification results show that this emotion recognition system can better the overall emotion recognition rate: the variance has been reduced to 0.0067, which is a decrease of 64% compared to that of the CSP_VAR_SVM (CVS) system. On the other hand, the average accuracy reaches 69.84%, which is 0.79% higher than that of the CVS system. It shows that the overall emotion recognition rate of the proposed emotion recognition system is more stable, and its emotion recognition rate is higher.

Numerous studies have been published on this topic, following generally the same schema: 1) presentation of emotional stimuli to a number of subjects during the recording of their EEG, 2) application of machine learning techniques to classify the subjects' emotions. The proposed approaches vary mainly in the type of features extracted from the EEG and in the employed classifiers, but it is difficult to compare the reported results due to the use of different datasets. In this paper, we present a new database for the analysis of valence (positive or negative emotions), which is made publicly available. The database comprises physiological recordings and 257-channel EEG data, contrary to all previously published datasets, which include at most 62 EEG channels. Furthermore, we reconstruct the brain activity on the cortical surface by applying source localization techniques. We then compare the performances of valence classification that can be achieved with various features extracted from all source regions (source space features) and from all EEG channels (sensor space features), showing that the source reconstruction improves the classification results. Finally, we discuss the influence of several parameters on the classification scores.

However, the effectiveness and accuracy of manually labeling EEG signals are barely satisfactory, due to lacking effective biomarkers. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning method network-based Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (N-TSK) for AD identification which employs the complex network theory and TSK fuzzy system. With the construction of functional network of AD subjects, the topological features of weighted and unweighted networks are extracted. Taken the network parameters as independent inputs, a fuzzy-system-based TSK model is established and further trained to identify AD EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in AD identification and ability of N-TSK fuzzy classifiers. The highest accuracy can achieve 97.3% for patients with closed eyes and 94.78% with open eyes. In addition, the performance of weighted N-TSK largely exceeds unweighted N-TSK. By further optimizing the network features utilized in the N-TSK fuzzy classifiers, it is found that local efficiency and clustering coefficient are the most effective factors in AD identification. This work provides a potential tool for identifying neurological disorders from the perspective of functional networks with EEG signal, especially contributing to the diagnosis and identification of AD.

It is expensive and time consuming to collect labeled EEG data for use in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, however. In this paper, a novel active learning method is proposed to minimize the amount of labeled, subject-specific EEG data required for effective classifier training, by combining measures of uncertainty and representativeness within an extreme learning machine (ELM). Following this approach, an ELM classifier was first used to select a relatively large batch of unlabeled examples, whose uncertainty was measured through the best-versus-second-best (BvSB) strategy. The diversity of each sample was then measured between the limited labeled training data and previously selected unlabeled samples, and similarity is measured among the previously selected samples. Finally, a tradeoff parameter is introduced to control the balance between informative and representative samples, and these samples are then used to construct a powerful ELM classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted using benchmark and multiclass motor imagery EEG datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the performance of the new algorithm exceeds or matches those of several state-of-the-art active learning algorithms. It is thereby shown that the proposed method improves classifier performance and reduces the need for training samples in BCI applications.

The excavation of valuable and discriminative feature information needs to be based on the reliable time-frequency analysis, which is the foremost precondition for feature engineering. However, relying on the high temporal resolution of MI-EEG, traditional feature extraction methods can only conduct the time-frequency analysis according to the superficial neurophysiological rhythm of EEG in the sensor domain. And more detailed time-frequency characteristics could hardly be embodied in a few channels of MI-EEG signals, which leads to a coarse selection of time-frequency interval and the resulted lower decoding effect. Therefore, a neurophysiology-based technique is needed for performing more exact time-frequency analysis. Based on the advanced EEG Source Imaging, a Wrapped Time-Frequency combined Selection in the Source Domain, which is denoted as WTFS-SD, is proposed for decoding the MI-tasks by applying Weighted Minimum Norm Estimate and CSP based sub-band feature extraction in this paper. Abundant comparative experiments are conducted on the BCI2000 system dataset with six subjects, and the results show that the proposed methods can select subject-specific optimal frequency band and TOI, which yields the highest average classification rate of 93.14% by 9-fold cross-validation at the same chance level as well as a superior mean kappa coefficient of 0.8627 across all subjects compared to other prevalent methods. This study will enhance the decoding of complex MI-tasks and be helpful for the development of intelligent BCI system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Especially if one applies a setup that might impact affective processing and relies on generalized models of affect. Additionally, using subjective assessment of ones affect as ground truth has often been disputed. To shed the light on the former challenge we explored the use of a convenient EEG system with 20 participants to capture their reaction to affective movie clips in a naturalistic setting. Employing state-of-the-art machine learning approach demonstrated that the highest performance is reached when combining linear features, namely symmetry features and single-channel features, with nonlinear ones derived by a multiscale entropy approach. Nevertheless, the best performance, reflected in the highest F1-score achieved in a binary classification task for valence was 0.71 and for arousal 0.62. The performance was 10-20% better compared to using ratings provided by 13 independent raters. We argue that affective self-assessment might be underrated and it is crucial to account for personal differences in both perception and physiological response to affective cues.

Machine learning validation of EEG plus tACS artefact removal	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; tACS; artefact removal	CURRENT STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SIGNALS	Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during transcranial alternating current simulation (tACS) is highly desirable in order to investigate brain dynamics during stimulation, but is corrupted by large amplitude stimulation artefacts. Artefact removal algorithms have been presented previously, but with substantial debates on their performance, utility, and the presence of any residual artefacts. This paper investigates whether machine learning can be used to validate artefact removal algorithms. The postulation is that residual artefacts in the EEG after cleaning would be independent of the experiment performed, making it impossible to differentiate between different parts of an EEG+tACS experiment, or between different behavioural tasks performed. Approach. Ten participates undertook two tasks (nBack and backwards digital recall) during simultaneous EEG+tACS, exercising different aspects of working memory. Stimulations during no task and sham conditions were also performed. A previously reported tACS artefact removal algorithm from our group was used to clean the EEG and a linear discriminant analysis was trained on the cleaned EEG to differentiate different parts of the experiment. Main results. Baseline, baseline during tACS, working memory task without tACS, and working memory task with tACS data segments could be differentiated with accuracies ranging from 65%-94%, far exceeding chance levels. EEG from the nBack and backwards digital recall tasks could be separated during stimulation, with an accuracy exceeding 72%. If residual tACS artefacts remained after the EEG cleaning these did not dominate the classification process. Significance. This helps in building confidence that true EEG information is present after artefact removal. Our methodology presents a new approach to validating tACS artefact removal approaches.

Indeed, this paper demonstrates that neural networks in conjunction with recursive least squares can be used sprucely for the identification of emotional states. In this regards, this report uses online sequential extreme learning machine to conceive the present emotion recognition system. To validate the efficiency of this machine learning, the performance of various popular feature extraction methods with the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals DEAP dataset, and two newly developed EEG datasets are systematically evaluated for this study. The first emotional experience was to conceive an emotional dataset containing the samples EEG of six selected emotion states (neutrality, amusement, surprise, compassion, attraction, and disgust), and the second one was to predict the difficulties encountered during playing a hard game. This has the goal to detect the concentration and anger emotional states. The purpose of this paper is to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition based on different emotional states. The features are extracted from the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. Based on the analysis of the identification system, the most significant features are extracted for each emotional state. The selected ones are then utilized in the emotion classification system. The present recognition system has 80% accuracy when using the DEAP database, 74.07% accuracy when using the first database, and obtains 61.11% accuracy when predicting difficulties in video games.

We present the first EEG dataset (available here) with recordings of subjects with genuine and fake emotional expressions. We build our experimental paradigm for classification of smiles; genuine smiles, fake/acted smiles and neutral expression. We propose multiple methods to extract intrinsic features from three EEG emotional expressions; genuine, neutral, and fake/acted smile. We extracted EEG features using three time-frequency analysis methods: discrete wavelet transforms (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and incorporating DWT into EMD (DWT-EMD) at three frequency bands. We then evaluated the proposed methods using several classifiers including, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN). We carried out an experimental paradigm on 28-subjects underwent three types of emotional expressions, genuine, neutral and fake/acted. The results showed that incorporating DWT into EMD extracted more hidden features than sole DWT or sole EMD method. The power spectral feature extracted by DWT, EMD, and DWT-EMD showed different neural patterns across the three emotional expressions at all the frequency bands. We performed binary classification experiments and achieved acceptable accuracy reaching a maximum of 84% in all type of emotions, classifiers and bands using sole DWT or EMD. Meanwhile, a combination of DWT-EMD achieved the highest classification accuracy with ANN in classifying true emotional expressions from fake expressions in the alpha and beta bands with an average accuracy of 94.3% and 84.1%, respectively. Our results suggest combining DWT-EMD for future emotion studies and highlight the association of alpha and beta frequency bands with emotions.

Online Classification of Multiple Motor Imagery Tasks Using Filter Bank Based Maximum-a-Posteriori Common Spatial Pattern Filters	IRBM			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Brain Computer Interface (BCI); Event-related de-synchronization; Filter bank, common spatial patterns; Motor imagery		Objective: The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel technique, called filter bank maximum a-posteriori common spatial pattern (FB-MAP-CSP) algorithm, for online classification of multiple motor imagery activities using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The proposed technique addresses the overfitting issue of CSP in addition to utilizing the spectral information of EEG signals inside the framework of filter banks while extending it to more than two conditions. Materials and methods: The classification of motor imagery signals is based upon the detection of event-related de-synchronization (ERD) phenomena in the mu and beta rhythms of EEG signals. Accordingly, two modifications in the existing MAP-CSP technique are presented: (i) The (pre-processed) EEG signals are spectrally filtered by a bank of filters lying in the mu and beta brainwave frequency range, (ii) the framework of MAP-CSP is extended to deal with multiple (more than two) motor imagery tasks classification and the spatial filters thus obtained are calculated for each sub-band, separately. Subsequently, the most imperative features over all sub-bands are selected and un-regularized linear discriminant analysis is employed for classification of multiple motor imagery tasks. Results: Publicly available dataset (BCI Competition IV Dataset I) is used to validate the proposed method i.e. FB-MAP-CSP. The results show that the proposed method yields superior classification results, in addition to be computationally more efficient in the case of online implementation, as compared to the conventional CSP based techniques and its variants for multiclass motor imagery classification. Conclusion: The proposed FB-MAP-CSP algorithm is found to be a potential / superior method for classifying multi-condition motor imagery EEG signals in comparison to FBCSP based techniques.

This research attempts to develop, test, and compare the performance of machine learning methods for classifying human driving behavior. It also proposes to correlate driver affective states with the driving behavior. The major contributions of this work are to classify the driver behavior using Electroencephalograph (EEG) while driving simulated vehicle and compare them with the behavior classified using vehicle parameters and affective states. The study involved both classical machine learning techniques such as k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and latest "unsupervised" Hybrid Deep Learning techniques, and compared the accuracy ofclassification across subjects, various driving scenarios and affective states.

Recent studies show that the brain tracks attended speech and that the attended talker can be decoded from neural data on a single-trial level. This raises the possibility of "neuro-steered" hearing devices in which the brain-decoded intention of a hearing-impaired listener is used to enhance the voice of the attended speaker from a speech separation front-end. So far, methods that use this paradigm have focused on optimizing the brain decoding and the acoustic speech separation independently. In this work, we propose a novel framework called brain-informed speech separation (BISS)(1) in which the information about the attended speech, as decoded from the subject's brain, is directly used to perform speech separation in the front-end. We present a deep learning model that uses neural data to extract the clean audio signal that a listener is attending to from a multi-talker speech mixture. We show that the framework can be applied successfully to the decoded output from either invasive intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) or non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from hearing-impaired subjects. It also results in improved speech separation, even in scenes with background noise. The generalization capability of the system renders it a perfect candidate for neuro-steered hearing-assistive devices.

A condition-independent framework for the classification of error-related brain activity	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						EEG; ErrP; Condition complexity; Classification; Feature selection	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; TASK-DIFFICULTY; PREDICTION ERRORS; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; RECOGNITION; INSIGHTS; CORRECT; PE	The cognitive processing and detection of errors is important in the adaptation of the behavioral and learning processes. This brain activity is often reflected as distinct patterns of event-related potentials (ERPs) that can be employed in the detection and interpretation of the cerebral responses to erroneous stimuli. However, high-accuracy cross-condition classification is challenging due to the significant variations of the error-related ERP components (ErrPs) between complexity conditions, thus hindering the development of error recognition systems. In this study, we employed support vector machines (SVM) classification methods, based on waveform characteristics of ErrPs from different time windows, to detect correct and incorrect responses in an audio identification task with two conditions of different complexity. Since the performance of the classifiers usually depends on the salience of the features employed, a combination of the sequential forward floating feature selection (SFFS) and sequential forward feature selection (SFS) methods was implemented to detect condition-independent and condition-specific feature subsets. Our framework achieved high accuracy using a small subset of the available features both for cross- and within-condition classification, hence supporting the notion that machine learning techniques can detect hidden patterns of ErrP-based features, irrespective of task complexity while additionally elucidating complexity-related error processing variations.

When using such signals, subtle limitations are often not readily apparent without significant domain expertise. Multimedia research outputs incorporating EEG signals can fail to be replicated when only minor modifications have been made to an experiment or seemingly unimportant (or unstated) details are changed. This can lead to overoptimistic or overpessimistic viewpoints on the potential real-world utility of these signals in multimedia research activities. This paper describes an EEG/MM dataset and presents a summary of distilled experiences and knowledge gained during the preparation (and utilisiation) of the dataset that supported a collaborative neural-image labelling benchmarking task. The goal of this task was to collaboratively identify machine learning approaches that would support the use of EEG signals in areas such as image labelling and multimedia modeling or retrieval. The contributions of this paper can be listed thus; a template experimental paradigm is proposed (along with datasets and a baseline system) upon which researchers can explore multimedia image labelling using a brain-computer interface, learnings regarding commonly encountered issues (and useful signals) when conducting research that utilises EEG in multimedia contexts are provided, and finally insights are shared on how an EEG dataset was used to support a collaborative neural-image labelling benchmarking task and the valuable experiences gained.

We used support vector machine decoding and representational similarity analysis to combine information from different locations (fMRI), time windows (EEG), and theoretical models. By correlating representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) derived from multiple pairwise classifications of neural responses to different facial expressions (neutral, happy, fearful, angry), we found early EEG time windows (starting around 130 ms) to match fMRI data from primary visual cortex (V1), and later time windows (starting around 190 ms) to match data from lateral occipital, fusiform face complex, and temporal-parietal-occipital junction (TPOJ). According to model comparisons, the EEG classification results were based more on low-level visual features than expression intensities or categories. In fMRI, the model comparisons revealed change along the processing hierarchy, from low-level visual feature coding in V1 to coding of intensity of expressions in the right TPOJ. The results highlight the importance of a multimodal approach for understanding the functional roles of different brain regions in face processing.	[Muukkonen, I; Olander, K.; Salmela, V.

No clear PNES electrophysiological biomarker has yet been found, and the only tool available for diagnosis is video EEG monitoring with recording of a typical episode and clinical history of the subject. In this paper, a data-driven machine learning (ML) pipeline for classifying EEG segments (i.e., epochs) of PNES and healthy controls (CNT) is introduced. This software pipeline consists of a semiautomatic signal processing technique and a supervised ML classifier to aid clinical discriminative diagnosis of PNES by means of an EEG time series. In our ML pipeline, statistical features like the mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, and skewness are extracted in a power spectral density (PSD) map split up in five conventional EEG rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and the whole band, i.e., 1-32 Hz). Then, the feature vector is fed into three different supervised ML algorithms, namely, the support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and Bayesian network (BN), to perform EEG segment classification tasks for CNT vs. PNES. The performance of the pipeline algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 20 EEG signals (10 PNES and 10 CNT) that was recorded in eyes-closed resting condition at the Regional Epilepsy Centre, Great Metropolitan Hospital of Reggio Calabria, University of Catanzaro, Italy. The experimental results showed that PNES vs. CNT discrimination tasks performed via the ML algorithm and validated with random split (RS) achieved an average accuracy of 0.97 +/- 0.013 (RS-SVM), 0.99 +/- 0.02 (RS-LDA), and 0.82 +/- 0.109 (RS-BN). Meanwhile, with leave-one-out (LOO) validation, an average accuracy of 0.98 +/- 0.0233 (LOO-SVM), 0.98 +/- 0.124 (LOO-LDA), and 0.81 +/- 0.109 (LOO-BN) was achieved. Our findings showed that BN was outperformed by SVM and LDA. The promising results of the proposed software pipeline suggest that it may be a valuable tool to support existing clinical diagnosis.

Topological data analysis (TDA) can decode patterns in EEG signals that are not captured by standard temporal and spectral features but at the same time reveal important information on the underlying brain processes of clinical interest. The heterogeneity of conditions associated with brain network disorders renders it highly challenging to develop statistical methods for analyzing topological features in patients' EEG signals. In this paper, we advance a generalized topological signal processing framework for extracting and analyzing topological features in EEG signals. The framework is applied to study EEG correlates of neural deficits in post-stroke aphasia patients.

Traditional methods based on artificially designed features have achieved valid results in EEG-based recognition, and numerous studies start to apply deep learning techniques in this area. In this article, we propose a coincidence-filtering-based method to build a connection between artificial-features-based methods and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and design CNNs through simulating the information extraction pattern of artificial-features-based methods. Based on this method, we propose a novel, simple, and effective CNNs structure for EEG-based classification. We implement two experiments to obtain EEG data, and perform experiments based on the two health monitoring tasks. The results illustrate that the proposed network can achieve a prominent average accuracy on the emotion recognition and fatigue driving detection task. Due to its generality, the proposed framework design of CNNs is expected to be useful for broader applications in health monitoring areas.

This paper proposes a novel solution for classification of left/right hand movement by exploiting a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with attention mechanism to learn the electroencephalogram (EEG) time-series information. To this end, a wide range of time and frequency domain features are extracted from the EEG signals and used to train an LSTM network to perform the classification task. We conduct extensive experiments with the EEG Movement dataset and show that our proposed solution our method achieves improvements over several benchmarks and state-of-the-art methods in both intra-subject and cross-subject validation schemes. Moreover, we utilize the proposed framework to analyze the information as received by the sensors and monitor the activated regions of the brain by tracking EEG topography throughout the experiments.

Most current works on this issue require a subject-specific adaptation step before applied to a new user. Thus the research of directly extending a pre-trained model to new users is particularly desired and indispensable. As brain dynamics fluctuate considerably across different subjects, it is challenging to design practical hand-crafted features based on prior knowledge. Regarding this gap, this paper proposes a Graph-based Convolutional Recurrent Attention Model (G-CRAM) to explore EEG features across different subjects for motor imagery classification. A graph structure is first developed to represent the positioning information of EEG nodes. Then a convolutional recurrent attention model learns EEG features from both spatial and temporal dimensions and emphasizes on the most distinguishable temporal periods. We evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark EEG datasets of motor imagery classification on the subject-independent testing. The results show that the G-CRAM achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods regarding recognition accuracy and ROC-AUC. Furthermore, model interpretation studies reveal the learning process of different neural network components and demonstrate that the proposed model can extract detailed features efficiently.

It can help patients with physical dyskinesia to convey their movement intentions. In recent years, breakthroughs have been made in the research on recognition of motor imagery task using deep learning, but if the important features related to motor imagery are ignored, it may lead to a decline in the recognition performance of the algorithm. This paper proposes a new deep multi-view feature learning method for the classification task of motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In order to obtain more representative motor imagery features in EEG signals, we introduced a multi-view feature representation based on the characteristics of EEG signals and the differences between different features. Different feature extraction methods were used to respectively extract the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain and spatial features of EEG signals, so as to made them cooperate and complement. Then, the deep restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) network improved by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding(t-SNE) was adopted to learn the multi-view features of EEG signals, so that the algorithm removed the feature redundancy while took into account the global characteristics in the multi-view feature sequence, reduced the dimension of the multi-visual features and enhanced the recognizability of the features. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) was chosen to classify deep multi-view features. Applying our proposed method to the BCI competition IV 2a dataset we obtained excellent classification results. The results show that the deep multi-view feature learning method further improved the classification accuracy of motor imagery tasks.

However, relatively little is known about functional connectivity in adult ADHD, and how it is linked with the heritability of ADHD. Methods: We measured eyes-open and eyes-closed resting electroencephalography (EEG) from 38 adults with ADHD, 45 1st degree relatives of people with ADHD and 51 healthy controls. Functional connectivity among all scalp channels was calculated using a weighted phase lag index for delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. A machine learning analysis using penalized linear regression was used to identify if connectivity features (10,080 connectivity pairs) could predict ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, we examined if EEG connectivity could accurately classify participants into ADHD, 1st degree relatives and/or control groups. Results: Hyperactive symptoms were best predicted by eyes-open EEG connectivity in delta, beta and gamma bands. Inattentive symptoms were predicted by eyes-open EEG connectivity in delta, alpha and gamma bands, and eyes-closed EEG connectivity in delta and gamma bands. EEG connectivity features did not reliably classify participants into groups. Conclusions: EEG connectivity may represent a neuromarker for ADHD symptoms. Significance: EEG connectivity may help elucidate the neural basis of adult ADHD symptoms. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Method: Thirteen subjects, all BCI-naive, performed four different tongue movements (up, down, left and right), which was detected against an idle state using a common spatial pattern filter with a linear discriminant analysis classifier. Furthermore, the movement types were classified in a one-versus all classification scheme. Results: On average, 72-76% of the movements were detected correctly against the idle state. When all movement types were pooled and detected against the idle state, an accuracy of 80% was obtained. A closer investigation showed that the system correctly detected up to 83% of the executed movements, but had a false positive rate of 13%. The movements were classified with an accuracy of 43%. This was increased to 55% when only left, right and up movements were considered. When only left and right movements where considered they were classified with an average accuracy of 71%. Conclusion: Decoding of tongue movements from the EEG can be used as a reliable control state switch in a BCI and is possible to classify the different movements above chance level. Significance: Residual tongue movements, which is not lost after a spinal cord injury, can be used as a reliable control state switch and it is possibly to detect at least four different movement types.

The novelty of the present research is to include phase information of the EEG signal along with the amplitude for differentiating class boundaries. Two modified CSP algorithms are proposed in this paper. The first one introduces the composite effect of amplitude and phase angle of the EEG signal in CSP formulation and is solved using Lagrange's multiplier method taking phase information of EEG into account. In the second approach, a novel CSP algorithm is proposed in this paper which has the efficacy of handling the non-linearities hidden in the brain signal, here EEG. Experiments undertaken confirm that the proposed phase-sensitive CSP yields the best performance than their non-phase sensitive counterparts by a large margin with respect to classification accuracy.

Furthermore, DNNs have been used for electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification in recent studies on brain-computer interface. However, most works use one-dimensional EEG features to learn DNNs that ignores the local information within multichannel or multiple frequency bands in the EEG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion recognition method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) while preventing the loss of local information. The proposed method consists of two parts. The first part generates topology-preserving differential entropy features while keeping the distance from the center electrode to other electrodes. The second part learns the proposed CNN to estimate three-class emotional states (positive, neutral, negative). We evaluate our work on SEED dataset, including 62-channel EEG signals recorded from 15 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved superior performance on SEED dataset with an average accuracy of 90.41% with the visualization of extracted features from the proposed CNN using t-SNE to show our representation outperforms the other representations based on standard features for EEG analysis. Besides, with the additional experiment on VIG dataset to estimate the vigilance of EEG dataset, we show the off-the-shelf availability of the proposed method.

Correct labels for these objects were known from parallel eye-tracking measurements. We extracted features from the time domain and from Pearson's correlation and applied both statistical and neuro-inspired supervised machine learning algorithms.

The emergence of affordable ECG and EEG sensors and ubiquitous mobile devices provides an opportunity to make such analysis accessible to everyone. In this paper, we propose the implementation of a neural network-based method for the automatic identification of the relationship between the previously known conditions of older adults and the different features calculated from the various signals. The data were collected using a smartphone and low-cost ECG and EEG sensors during the performance of the timed-up and go test. Different patterns related to the features extracted, such as heart rate, heart rate variability, average QRS amplitude, average R-R interval, and average R-S interval from ECG data, and the frequency and variability from the EEG data were identified. A combination of these parameters allowed us to identify the presence of certain diseases accurately. The analysis revealed that the different institutions and ages were mainly identified. Still, the various diseases and groups of diseases were difficult to recognize, because the frequency of the different diseases was rare in the considered population. Therefore, the test should be performed with more people to achieve better results.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to identify occurrences of seizures in EEG epochs from the EEG signals and an onset-offset detector is proposed to determine the seizure onsets and offsets. The EEG signals are considered as inputs and the outputs are the onset and offset. In the CNN, a filter is factorized to separately capture temporal and spatial patterns in EEG epochs. Moreover, we develop an onset-offset detection method based on clinical decision criteria. As a result, verified on the whole CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, the CNN model correctly detected seizure activities over 90%. Furthermore, combined with the onset-offset detector, this method accomplished F-1 of 64.40% and essentially determined the seizure onset and offset with absolute onset and offset latencies of 5.83 and 10.12 seconds, respectively.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is currently a supportive biomarker in the diagnosis of DLB. We performed a systematic review to better clarify the diagnostic and prognostic role of EEG in DLB and define the clinical correlates of various EEG features described in DLB. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched using search strategies for relevant articles up to 6 August 2020. We included 43 studies comparing EEG in DLB with other diagnoses, 42 of them included a comparison of DLB with AD, 10 studies compared DLB with Parkinson's disease dementia, and 6 studies compared DLB with other dementias. The studies were visual EEG assessment (6), quantitative EEG (35) and event-related potential studies (2). The most consistent observation was the slowing of the dominant EEG rhythm (<8 Hz) assessed visually or through quantitative EEG, which was observed in similar to 90% of patients with DLB and only similar to 10% of patients with AD. Other findings based on qualitative rating, spectral power analyses, connectivity, microstate and machine learning algorithms were largely heterogenous due to differences in study design, EEG acquisition, preprocessing and analysis. EEG protocols should be standardized to allow replication and validation of promising EEG features as potential biomarkers in DLB.

The manual inspection of EEG signals is subjected to human error and is a tedious process. Further, an accurate diagnosis of generalized and focal epileptic seizures from normal EEG signals is vital for the supervision of pertinent treatment, life advancement of the subjects, and reduction in cost for the subjects. Hence the development of automatic detection of generalized and focal epileptic seizures from normal EEG signals is important. An approach based on tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT), entropies, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is proposed in this work for detection of epileptic seizures and its types. Two EEG databases namely, Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences (KITS) EEG database and Temple University Hospital (TUH) database consisting of normal, generalized and focal EEG signals is used in this work to analyze the performance of the proposed approach. Initially, the EEG signals are decomposed into sub-bands using TQWT and the non-linear features like log energy entropy, Shannon entropy and Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) entropy is computed from each sub-band. The informative features from the computed feature vectors are selected using PSO and fed into ANN for the classification of EEG signals. The proposed algorithm for KITS database achieved a maximum accuracy of 100% for four experimental cases namely, (i) normal-focal, (ii) normal-generalised, (iii) normal-focal + generalised and (iv) normal-focal-generalised. The TUH database achieved an accuracy of 95.1%, 97.4%, 96.2% and 88.8% for the four experimental cases. The proposed approach is promising and able to discriminate the epileptic seizure types with satisfactory classification performance.

It is particularly important for overcoming time-consuming, difficult, and error-prone manual analysis of long-term EEG recordings. This paper presents a new method to detect SWD, with a low computational complexity making it easily trained with data from standard medical protocols. Precisely, EEG signals are divided into time segments for which the continuous Morlet 1-D wavelet decomposition is computed. The generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) is fitted to the resulting coefficients and their variance and median are calculated. Next, a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier is trained to detect the spike-and-wave patterns, using the scale parameter of the GGD in addition to the variance and the median. Experiments were conducted using EEG signals from six human patients. Precisely, 106 spike-and-wave and 106 non-spike-and-wave signals were used for training, and 96 other segments for testing. The proposed SWD classification method achieved 95% sensitivity (True positive rate), 87% specificity (True Negative Rate), and 92% accuracy. These promising results set the path for new research to study the causes underlying the so-called absence epilepsy in long-term EEG recordings.

The aim of this paper is to look at multi-scaling properties obtained by multi-scale analysis (MSA) as main distinctive features to simultaneously distinguish between all categories of EEG signals that compose the popular database hosted by the department of epileptology, University of Bonn, Germany. Particularly, multi-scale analysis is employed to capture long-range properties of the EEG signal at different scales used to represent its short and long variations. Then, the obtained multi-scale properties are used to train four different classifiers; namely, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), naive Bayes (NB), and the support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results based on ten-fold cross-validation method show that each single classifier achieves 100% accuracy. In this respect, multi-scale properties are found to be effective as they outperformed existing works on the same database by achieving perfect accuracy to distinguish between all five distinct EEG categories. Overall, the obtained results are promising.

Distinguishing vigilance decrement and low task demands from mind-wandering: A machine learning analysis of EEG	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillation; independent component analysis; mind-wandering; support vector machine; task demands; vigilance	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPONTANEOUS THOUGHT; BRAIN; NETWORK; CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; RELEVANT; HUMANS	Mind-wandering is a ubiquitous mental phenomenon that is defined as self-generated thought irrelevant to the ongoing task. Mind-wandering tends to occur when people are in a low-vigilance state or when they are performing a very easy task. In the current study, we investigated whether mind-wandering is completely dependent on vigilance and current task demands, or whether it is an independent phenomenon. To this end, we trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers on EEG data in conditions of low and high vigilance, as well as under conditions of low and high task demands, and subsequently tested those classifiers on participants' self-reported mind-wandering. Participants' momentary mental state was measured by means of intermittent thought probes in which they reported on their current mental state. The results showed that neither the vigilance classifier nor the task demands classifier could predict mind-wandering above-chance level, while a classifier trained on self-reports of mind-wandering was able to do so. This suggests that mind-wandering is a mental state different from low vigilance or performing tasks with low demands-both which could be discriminated from the EEG above chance. Furthermore, we used dipole fitting to source-localize the neural correlates of the most import features in each of the three classifiers, indeed finding a few distinct neural structures between the three phenomena. Our study demonstrates the value of machine-learning classifiers in unveiling patterns in neural data and uncovering the associated neural structures by combining it with an EEG source analysis technique.

The visual stimuli comprise of four face images: two happy (one male and one female) and two unhappy (one male and one female). The neuronal response is decoded using a combination of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ensemble classifier. The features are extracted by decomposition of recorded EEG signals using Daubechies wavelet filter (db4) and used the statistical methods such as the absolute mean value, power, and standard deviation for classification. The proposed methodology is validated on in-house recorded visual attention EEG (VA-EEG) dataset using six subjects (three males, three females) and evaluated the performance on six binary combinations of facial stimuli. The performance results show that the binary combination of male happy (MH) and female happy (FH) facial stimuli aids in cognitive enhancement for the people suffering from cognitive symptoms. The proposed low-complex feature extraction classification framework obtained a mean classification accuracy (CA) and a mean kappa value of 86.58% and 0.72, respectively.

By combining our non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) protocol on dogs with machine-learning algorithms, we show category-specific dog brain responses to pictures of human and dog facial expressions, objects, and phase-scrambled faces. We trained a support vector machine classifier with spatiotemporal EEG data to discriminate between responses to pairs of images. The classification accuracy was highest for humans or dogs vs. scrambled images, with most informative time intervals of 100-140 ms and 240-280 ms. We also detected a response sensitive to threatening dog faces at 30-40 ms; generally, responses differentiating emotional expressions were found at 130-170 ms, and differentiation of faces from objects occurred at 120-130 ms. The cortical sources underlying the highest-amplitude EEG signals were localized to the dog visual cortex.

FPGA Implementation of Epileptic Seizure Detection Using ELM Classifier	2020 SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO SIGNALS, IMAGES, AND INSTRUMENTATION (ICBSII)			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bio Signals, Images, and Instrumentation (ICBSII)	FEB 27-28, 2020	Chennai, INDIA			Electroencephalography EEG; Epileptic; Linear prediction; FPGA; ELM		Electroencephalography (EEG) Signals are widely used to determine the brain disorders. The Electrical activity of human brain is recorded in the form of EEG signal. The abnormal Electrical activity of the human brain is called as epileptic seizure. In epilepsy patients, the seizure occurs at unpredictable times and it causes sudden death. Detection and Prediction of Epileptic seizure is performed by analyzing the EEG signal. The EEG signal of human brain is random in nature, hence detection of seizure in EEG signal is challenging task. Hardware implementation of Epileptic seizure detection system is necessary for real time applications. In this work an accurate approach is used to identify the Epileptic seizure and that is implemented in FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).The hardware implementation of epileptic seizure detection algorithm is done using Xilinx System generator tool. In the first step the EEG signal is extracted from the human brain and it is filtered by using Finite Impulse response (FIR) band pass filter. The band pass filter separates the EEG signal into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma brain rhythms. The band separated brain signal is modeled by linear prediction theory. In the next step features are extracted from the modeled EEG signal and the classification of normal or seizure signal is done by using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier. The EEG signals used in this paper were obtained from Epilepsy Center at the University of Bonn, Germany. The hardware architecture, Look up tables, resource utilization, Accuracy and power consumption of the algorithm is analyzed using xilinx zynq-7000 all programmable soc.	[Jose, J.

It has affected around 15 million people annually worldwide. Methods of stroke discovery and monitoring the patient's recovery are a long process, ranging from the analysis of medical images to frequent reporting of the patients for progress assessment. In this paper, we aim to process stroke patient EEG signals by a deep learning approach, and classify a given EEG signal into stroke/non-stroke. In particular, our model consists of several sub-modules which convert and re-model widely used signal processing techniques such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Convolution in the Frequency Domain and the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to learnable and differentiable functions that are completely learned and optimized in an end-to-end manner by neural networks. We demonstrate that our model outperforms several baselines by learning rich frequency features through our proposed model. The proposed model could potentially assist a medical doctor in analyzing stroke brain images with high accuracy rates. It can also be useful for rehabilitation centers to monitor the progress of stroke patients.

In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the $P3$ and $N2$ components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.

Although many studies on electroencephalography-brain-computer interface (BCI) used ensemble classifiers to enhance the BCI performance, ensemble classifiers have hardly been employed for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-BCIs. In addition, since there has not been any systematic and comparative study, the efficacy of ensemble classifiers for NIRS-BCIs remains unknown. In this study, four NIRS-BCI datasets were employed to evaluate the efficacy of linear discriminant analysis ensemble classifiers based on the bootstrap aggregating. From the analysis results, significant (or marginally significant) increases in the bitrate as well as the classification accuracy were found for all four NIRS-BCI datasets employed in this study. Moreover, significant bitrate improvements were found in two of the four datasets.

A brain-computer interface using electroencephalography (EEG) is applied to satisfy this requirement. A number of research studies to recognize brain signals using machine learning and deep neural networks (DNNs) have been performed to increase the brain signal detection rate, yet there are several defects and limitations in the techniques. Among them is the use in specific circumstances of machine learning. On the one hand, DNNs extract the features well and automatically. On the other hand, their use results in overfitting and vanishing problems. Consequently, in this research, a deep network is designed on the basis of an autoencoder neural Turing machine (DN-AE-NTM) to resolve the problems by the use of NTM external memory. In addition, the DN-AE-NTM copes with all kinds of signals with high detection rates. The data were collected by P300 EEG devices from several individuals under the same conditions. During the test, each individual was requested to skim images with one to six labels and focus on only one of the images. Not to focus on some images is analogous to producing unimportant information in the individual's brain, which provides unfamiliar signals. Besides the main P300 EEG dataset, EEG recordings of individuals with alcoholism and control individuals and the EEGMMIDB, MNIST, and ORL datasets were implemented and tested. The proposed DN-AE-NTM method classifies data with an average detection rate of 97.5%, 95%, 98%, 99.4%, and 99.1%, respectively, in situations where the signals are noisy so that only 20% of the data are reliable and include useful information.

A computerized seizure identification scheme can eradicate the above problems, assist clinicians, and benefit epilepsy research. So far, several attempts were made to develop automatic systems to help neurophysiologists accurately identify epileptic seizures. In this research, a fully automated system is presented to automatically detect the various states of the epileptic seizure. This study is based on sparse representation-based classification (SRC) theory and the proposed dictionary learning using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Furthermore, this work does not require additional preprocessing and extraction of features, which is common in the existing methods. This study reached the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100% in 8 out of 9 scenarios. It is also robust to the measurement noise of level as much as 0 dB. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and other common methods, our method outperformed them in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

DC-SNN employs two hidden layers. First hidden layer has receptive field neurons that convert the real-valued input features to spike patterns and the second hidden layer employs LIF neurons with inhibitory interconnections. The second hidden layer has been termed as the distributed coding layer in the rest of the paper. The inhibitory interconnections in distributed coding layer will ensure that each neuron in this layer learns a distinct spike pattern from input feature space. The synaptic weights between layers and the weights of lateral inhibitory connections are learned using a self-regulated learning algorithm. Self-regulation identifies neurons for updating in the output layer and distributed coding layer and also adapts the learning rate based on the temporal separation between spikes in the output layer. It also skips learning from samples which are correctly classified with higher temporal separation and hence prevents over-training. The detailed performance comparisons of DC-SNN with other algorithms for SNNs in the literature using six benchmark data set from the UCI machine learning repository has been presented. Further, the performance of DC-SNN is evaluated on a real -world brain computer interface problem for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded during motorimagery tasks. The results clearly indicate that the proposed DC-SNN architecture provides slightly better generalization ability and is suitable for deep spiking networks.

Imagined speech and visual imagery are emerging paradigms that can directly convey a user's intention. We investigated the underlying characteristics that affect the decoding performance of these two paradigms. Twenty-two subjects performed imagined speech and visual imagery of twelve words/phrases frequently used for patients' communication. Spectral features were analyzed with thirteen-class classification (including rest class) using EEG filtered in six frequency ranges. In addition, cortical regions relevant to the two paradigms were analyzed by classification using single-channel and pre-defined cortical groups. Furthermore, we analyzed the word properties that affect the decoding performance based on the number of syllables, concrete and abstract concepts, and the correlation between the two paradigms. Finally, we investigated multiclass scalability in both paradigms. The high-frequency band displayed a significantly superior performance to that in the case of any other spectral features in the thirteen-class classification (imagined speech: 39.73 +/- 5.64%; visual imagery: 40.14 +/- 4.17%). Furthermore, the performance of Broca's and Wernicke's areas and auditory cortex was found to have improved among the cortical regions in both paradigms. As the number of classes increased, the decoding performance decreased moderately. Moreover, every subject exceeded the confidence level performance, implying the strength of the two paradigms in BCI inefficiency. These two intuitive paradigms were found to be highly effective for multiclass communication systems, having considerable similarities between each other. The results could provide crucial information for improving the decoding performance for practical BCI applications.

Previous research papers were published exploring the possible techniques to utilize the EEG signals for detecting and predicting seizure onsets through Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks. The aim of this work is to build practical hardware-implementable Machine Learning classifiers capable of predicting the seizure onsets prior to their occurrences with high sensitivity and accuracy. The classification method proposed involves removing certain channels for each patient, extracting the features from the EEG signal, selecting the best feature combination for each patient, and finally training the selected SVM classifier accordingly. Evaluating the performance of the proposed classification technique yields promising results for the selected patients with accuracies exceeding 95%.

Clinical diagnosis of IA is still in its beginnings, resulting in delays or failures in psychological interventions. Predictive healthcare analytics can increase the speed and robustness of diagnosis, resulting in faster preventive interventions. By unfolding the conventional frequency bandwidths into a fine-graded equidistant 88- point spectrum, we present a method for detecting premature IA. We identified the most predictive frequency sub-bands that differentiate healthy persons from people suffering from preliminary stages of IA (10.5-11 Hz, 21.5- 22 Hz, 22.5-23 Hz). With a balanced accuracy of 94.17%, our results set a new benchmark in detecting IA using resting-state electroencephalography recordings. We provide evidence that IA can lead to structural changes in the brain and thus indicates the need for it to be considered alongside other generally recognized disorders.

For the establishment of an accurate and efficient epilepsy EEG identification system, it is very important to properly extract the features of EEG signals and select appropriate combination features. This paper proposes an automatic epileptic EEG identification method based on hybrid feature extraction. It uses temporal and frequency domain analysis, nonlinear analysis and one-dimensional local pattern recognition method to extract epileptic EEG features. Gradient energy operator and local speed pattern are proposed to better reflect typical feature in the active EEG signals measured during seizure-free intervals. The genetic algorithm is used to select the obtained hybrid features; then the AdaBoost classifier is used to classify epileptic EEG under various classification conditions. Classification results on the dataset developed by University of Bonn show that the proposed method can be used to classify normal EEG, interictal EEG and seizure activity with only a few features. Compared with related researches using the same dataset, the proposed method can obtain an equally satisfactory classification accuracy while the feature amount is reduced by 61-95%. In particular, the classification accuracy of the interictal and normal EEG can reach 99%.

Although the overall MI classification accuracy has been largely enhanced from previous efforts, applying MI- BCI to the so-called BCI-illiterate subjects remains as an unsolved problem. This study proposed a physiological approach for improving MI-BCI performance, by measuring the baseline attention level estimated by coefficient F from the electroencephalogram (EEG) band-activities. In this endeavor, a total of 9 MI-EEG recordings were retrieved from an open BCI dataset. A measure of attention level was calculated for each trial to select high attention trials. High attention trial-based machine learning model showed higher MI classification performance (median accuracy = 62.50% (interquartile range (IQR) = 55.21 - 82.29%)) than the conventional approach (median accuracy = 57.64% (IQR = 54.17 - 62.50%)) with statistical significance (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.037). This study found that machine learning models trained from high attention trials yield improved classification accuracy to the models derived from total trial regardless of both BCI illiterate and literate.

These types of pain require intervention and relief and sudden pain belongs to one of them. Therefore, this paper proposes on a method of sudden pain recognition based on resting state EEG signals. This method can recognize the presence of sudden pain, distinguish the location of pain and can be effectively applied to disease diagnosis. The platform of sudden pain stimulation and EEG acquisition system was designed and built, and a series of experiments were carried out for different subjects. We preprocessed the raw EEG signals and extracted features via Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA). We also utilized the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Sparse Bayesian Extreme Learning Machine (SBELM) and D-S Evidence Theory to do classification, utilizing 10-Fold Cross-validation. The results suggested that the accuracy of judging the presence of pain was up to 89.3 % on average, accuracy of pain location discrimination was up to 81.3 % on average, and accuracy of cross validation was up to 90.1 %.

Epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal activities in brain that can affect patient's health. If the occurrence of seizure could be predicted well in advance, it could be prevented through medication or proper actions. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is generally used to detect epilepsy as EEG is capable of capturing the electrical activity of brain. In literature, many machine learning techniques were used to extract features from EEG recordings and predict the occurrence seizures. However, techniques with competent performance and clinical applicability are still desirable. We can use the power of modern machine learning techniques to improve the results of seizure prediction which would help to warn the patients for upcoming seizure.

In the last few decades, EEG is also being used for user brainwave reading for various purposes in computer science and other related branches. In the same direction, attempts were made here to validate two classes of what the user is thinking with the help of CNN. The study was conducted and found that accuracy was having the scope of improvement while having the same task being implemented using ANN and other machine learning techniques such as SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forests, etc. After finding these techniques to be less effective in finding sufficient accuracy, CNN comes to help to find better accuracy. The research here surrounds binary classification with exceptional accuracy of 99.82% with a dataset of 14 participants.

Stable deciphering of EEG is one of the leading challenges in BCI design owing to low signal to noise ratio and non-stationarities. Presence of non-stationarities in the EEG signals significantly perturb the feature distribution thus deteriorating the performance of Brain Computer Interface. Stationary Subspace methods discover subspaces in which data distribution remains steady over time. In this paper, we develop novel spatial filtering based feature extraction methods for dealing with nonstationarity in EEG signals from a drowsiness detection problem (a machine learning regression problem). The proposed method: DivOVR-FuzzyCSP-WS based features clearly outperformed fuzzy CSP based baseline features in terms of both RMSE and CC performance metrics. It is hoped that the proposed feature extraction method based on DivOVR-FuzzyCSP-WS will bring in a lot of interest in researchers working in developing algorithms for signal processing, in general, for BCI regression problems.

Cross-Domain MLP and CNN Transfer Learning for Biological Signal Processing: EEG and EMG	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Electromyography; Brain modeling; Signal processing; Muscles; Neural networks; Applied machine learning; biological signal processing; EEG; EMG; knowledge adaptation; neural networks; transfer learning		In this work, we show the success of unsupervised transfer learning between Electroencephalographic (brainwave) classification and Electromyographic (muscular wave) domains with both MLP and CNN methods. To achieve this, signals are measured from both the brain and forearm muscles and EMG data is gathered from a 4-class gesture classification experiment via the Myo Armband, and a 3-class mental state EEG dataset is acquired via the Muse EEG Headband. A hyperheuristic multi-objective evolutionary search method is used to find the best network hyperparameters. We then use this optimised topology of deep neural network to classify both EMG and EEG signals, attaining results of 84.76 & x0025; and 62.37 & x0025; accuracy, respectively. Next, when pre-trained weights from the EMG classification model are used for initial distribution rather than random weight initialisation for EEG classification, 93.82 & x0025;(& x002B;29.95) accuracy is reached. When EEG pre-trained weights are used for initial weight distribution for EMG, 85.12 & x0025; (& x002B;0.36) accuracy is achieved. When the EMG network attempts to classify EEG, it outperforms the EEG network even without any training (& x002B;30.25 & x0025; to 82.39 & x0025; at epoch 0), and similarly the EEG network attempting to classify EMG data outperforms the EMG network (& x002B;2.38 & x0025; at epoch 0). All transfer networks achieve higher pre-training abilities, curves, and asymptotes, indicating that knowledge transfer is possible between the two signal domains. In a second experiment with CNN transfer learning, the same datasets are projected as 2D images and the same learning process is carried out. In the CNN experiment, EMG to EEG transfer learning is found to be successful but not vice-versa, although EEG to EMG transfer learning did exhibit a higher starting classification accuracy. The significance of this work is due to the successful transfer of ability between models trained on two different biological signal domains, reducing the need for building more computationally complex models in future research.

In this paper, we proposed a novel multiple MI experimental paradigm which includes left hand, right hand, both hands, and feet. Based on the proposed paradigm, ten subjects participated in the data collection experiment at Jiangmen Brain-like Computation and Hybrid Intelligence R&D Center. Furthermore, we proposed an algorithm for MI neural decoding. Firstly, combining the one-vs-rest (OVR) strategy with the filter bank common spatial pattern (FB-CSP), we extract the features of multiple-class MI. Secondly, F-score optimization is used for features selection and then features are feed to a spiking neural network (SNN) for classification. Evaluation experimental results show that the averaged accuracy for four MI classification was up to 6130% (average kappa: 0.482). The feasibility and effectiveness of the experimental paradigm prove that it can he used as an alternative way and has practical significance.

Epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, an important means to judge epileptic seizure, needs neurologists' prior knowledge to mark manually. This marking method is time-consuming and laborious. Currently, the existing automated diagnosis methods have achieved good results on one benchmark EEG dataset, most of which can achieve accuracy of more than 0.95. However, the method has limitations on the dataset, and the accuracy of the diagnosis results on another new dataset drops sharply to nearly 0.5. Aiming at the existing EEG signal diagnosis lacks stability and generalization ability, this paper proposed a multilayer-weighted integrated self-learning algorithm for different classifiers. For this algorithm, weighted voting was first conducted on the the diagnostic results by different classifiers to obtain a result, which was weighted again to produce the final diagnostic results. This algorithm improves the problem that the traditional self-learning algorithm is greatly affected by data noise, which shows a strong stability in different data sets and in clinical epileptic EEG signal data detection, so as to reduce the workload of neurologists and provide support and assistance for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. The experiment result shows that the algorithm can improve the stability and reliability of EEG automatic diagnosis of epilepsy. The accuracy and AUC area of its classification in two different public data sets and clinical data can reach 0.80 to 0.95.

It is usually electroencephalogram (EEG) based and uses motor imagery (MI) in its operation. EEG signals are known for being nonstationary and are sensitive to artifacts from various sources such as the physical and mental state of the patient, their mood, their posture, and any external noise or distractions, etc. Processing of this data directly affects the classification accuracy, making it a critical step in any BCI system. Ensemble learning has been used for many kinds of BCI classification applications including MI and P300 event related potential, which has been proven to be robust. The purpose of this paper is to generate an algorithm that uses ensemble pruning method for EEG classification evoked by an MI task. In order to achieve this, we extracted the features of an EEG dataset and trained a range of support vector machines to make a diverse ensemble of classifiers. This ensemble is then pruned by using a novel optimization model by a difference of convex algorithm, which has not been used on EEG data before.

However, so far it is unknown that how the performance of such a decoder is affected by the decrease in spectral resolution and the electrical artifacts introduced by a cochlear implant (CI) in users of these prostheses. NH listeners and bilateral CI users participated in the present study. Speeches from two audio books, one uttered by a male voice and one by a female voice, were presented to NH listeners and CI users. Participants were instructed to attend to one of the two speech streams presented dichotically while a 96-channel EEG was recorded. Speech envelope reconstruction from the EEG data was obtained by training decoders using a regularized least square estimation method. Decoding accuracy was defined as the percentage of accurately reconstructed trials for each subject. For NH listeners, the experiment was repeated using a vocoder to reduce spectral resolution and simulate speech perception with a CI in NH listeners. The results showed a decoding accuracy of 80.9% using the original sound files in NH listeners. The performance dropped to 73.2% in the vocoder condition and to 71.5 % in the group of CI users. In sum, although the accuracy drops when the spectral resolution becomes worse, the results show the feasibility to decode the attended sound source in NH listeners with a vocoder simulation, and even in CI users, albeit more training data are needed.

J	Yan, MM; Lv, Z; Sun, WH; Bi, N				Yan, Mengmeng; Lv, Zhao; Sun, Wenhui; Bi, Ning			An improve d common spatial pattern combine d with channel-selection strategy for electroencephalography-based emotion recognition	MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS			English	Article						Common spatial pattern (CSP); Emotion recognition; Joint approximation diagonalization (JAD); Channel selection	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG; VARIABILITY; SYSTEM; RATES; BCI	Emotional human-computer interaction (HCI) has become an important research area in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, owing to the requirement for active emotion perception. To enhance the performance of electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotional HCI, this paper proposes an improved common spatial pattern combined with a channel-selection strategy (ICSPCS) for EEG-based emotion recognition. Specifically, we first use a common spatial pattern algorithm to design a spatial domain filter according to three different emotions (positive, neutral, and negative). The traditional joint approximation diagonalization method using the criterion of the "highest score eigenvalue" may be unable to solve multiple classifications of emotion representation. Therefore, we design three different eigenvalue selection methods in terms of the positions of the eigenvalues with the highest scores. Finally, to make the installation easier and reduce the computational load, we also develop a channel-selection strategy based on the weight values that individually reflect the degrees of influence of all the channels on emotion recognition. Experiments are conducted on a self-collected dataset and on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset. The average recognition accuracies for the three emotion tasks are found to be 85.85% and 94.13% on the self-collected and MAHNOB-HCI datasets, respectively, thus proving the effectiveness of the proposed ICSPCS method for emotion recognition.

An encephalogram (EEG) is a gold standard method in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, the standard EEG recording system is too obstructive to be used in daily life. Behind-the-ear EEG is an alternative approach to record EEG conveniently. Previous researchers applied machine learning to automatically detect seizures with EEG, but the epileptic EEG waveform contains subtle changes that are difficult to be identified. Furthermore, the extremely small proportion of ictal events in the long-term monitoring may cause the imbalance problem and, consequently, poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. In this study, we present an automatic seizure detection algorithm with a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained by unsupervised learning and evaluated it with behind-the-ear EEG. Methods: We recorded behind-the-ear EEGs from 12 patients who have various types of epilepsy. Data were reviewed separately by two epileptologists, who determined the onsets and ends of seizures. First, we conducted unsupervised learning with the normal records for the GAN to learn the representation of normal states. Second, we performed automatic seizure detection with the trained GAN as an anomaly detector. Last, we combined the Gram matrix with other anomaly losses to improve detection performance. Results: The proposed approach achieved detection performance with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.939 and sensitivity of 96.3% with a false alarm rate of 0.14 per hour in the test dataset. In addition, we confirmed distinguishability with the distribution of the anomaly scores in terms of EEG frequency bands. Conclusions: It is expected that the proposed anomaly detection via GAN with the behind-the-ear EEG can be effectively used for long-term seizure monitoring in daily life. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The emotion recognition platform used two combined machine learning approaches based on two systems input and preprocessing: An EEG-based emotion recognition system and an ECG/PPG-based system. The EEG-based system is a convolution neural network (CNN) that classifies three emotions, happiness, anger and sadness. The inputs of the CNN are extracted from the EEG signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and the average accuracy for a subject-independent classification reached 76.94%. The ECG/PPG-based system used a similar CNN with an extracted features vector as input. The subject-dependent ECG/PPG classification system reached an average accuracy of 76.8%. The proposed system was integrated using the RISC-V processor and FPGA platforms to implement real-time monitoring and classification on edge. A 3-to-1 Bluetooth piconet was deployed to transmit all physiological signals on a single platform access point and to make use of low power wireless technologies.

As a most common-used algorithm in feature extraction, common spatial pattern (CSP) has a good effect in MI electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. However, the robustness of CSP is poor with small training samples. Furthermore, obvious performance variability occurs between frequency bands for different individuals. To address these two problems simultaneously, filter band component regularized common spatial patterns (FCCSP) is proposed by reducing estimation variance, adding priors on the spatial filters, and considering more local frequency domain information. Firstly, EEG signals are divided into four sub-bands using wavelet packet. Secondly, the component regularized common spatial patterns (CRCSP) that could extract key features by regularizing the covariance matrix estimation and the objective function is proposed. CRCSP makes the best of neurophysiology priors which is useful in improving the robustness of the covariance matrix. Thereafter, minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) is applied to discard the irrelevant and redundant features. The final feature set as input is feed into linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Our proposed algorithm has been evaluated using public dataset BCI Competition III dataset IVa. The evaluation of our experiment involving 5 different subjects demonstrates the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm over its classical counterparts: the mean classification accuracy was increased by 15.72%. Experimental results verify particularly excellent performance as compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Meta Learn on Constrained Transfer Learning for Low Resource Cross Subject EEG Classification	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain modeling; Feature extraction; Electroencephalography; Adaptation models; Task analysis; Data models; Training; Transfer learning; EEG classification; meta learning; interpretable learning	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal has large variance and its pattern differs significantly across subjects. Cross subject EEG classification is a challenging task due to such pattern variation and the limited target data available, as collecting and annotating EEG data for a new user is costly and involve efforts from human experts. We model the task as a transfer learning problem and propose to tackle it with meta learning on constrained transfer learning (MLCL). MLCL is an end to end trainable learning paradigm that trains on large standard datasets of known subjects and then quickly adapt to a new subject with minimal target data. The transfer process is accelerated by applying model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm, performed under a novel constrained setting which keeps enough flexibility to adapt to new subject while significantly reducing number of parameters to transfer. This enables the adaptation done with a small amount of target data. The method can be applied to all deep learning oriented models. We performed extensive experiments across three public datasets. The proposed model outperforms current state of the arts in terms of both accuracy and AUC-ROC score for low target resource configurations. We further conducted interpretation analysis on the model, which reveals detailed information at the resolution of individual channels for the transfer process.

We present different moving visual stimuli to the subjects and accordingly analyze the complex structure of electromyography (EMG) signal versus the complex structure of electroencephalography (EEG) signal using fractal theory. Based on the obtained results from analysis, presenting the stimulus with greater complexity causes greater change in the complexity of EMG and EEG signals. Statistical analysis also supported the results of analysis and showed that visual stimulus with greater complexity has greater effect on the complexity of EEG and EMG signals. Therefore, we showed the relationship between facial muscles and brain activities in this paper. The method of analysis in this research can be further employed to investigate the relationship between other human organs' activities and brain activity.

J	Narayanan, AM; Bertrand, A				Narayanan, Abhijith Mundanad; Bertrand, Alexander			Analysis of Miniaturization Effects and Channel Selection Strategies for EEG Sensor Networks With Application to Auditory Attention Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Electrodes; Decoding; Scalp; Correlation; Wireless sensor networks; Auditory attention detection; brain-computer interface; channel selection; EEG processing; EEG sensor networks	WIRELESS EEG; SPEECH; REGRESSION	Objective: Concealable, miniaturized electroencephalography (mini-EEG) recording devices are crucial enablers toward long-term ambulatory EEG monitoring. However, the resulting miniaturization limits the inter-electrode distance and the scalp area that can be covered by a single device. The concept of wireless EEG sensor networks (WESNs) attempts to overcome this limitation by placing a multitude of these mini-EEG devices at various scalp locations. We investigate whether optimizing the WESN topology can compensate for miniaturization effects in an auditory attention detection (AAD) paradigm. Methods: Starting from standard full-cap high-density EEG data, we emulate several candidate mini-EEG sensor nodes that locally collect EEG data with embedded electrodes separated by short distances. We propose a greedy group-utility based channel selection strategy to select a subset of these candidate nodes to form a WESN. We compare the AAD performance of this WESN with the performance obtained using long-distance EEG recordings. Results: The AAD performance using short-distance EEG measurements is comparable to using an equal number of long-distance EEG measurements if, in both cases, the optimal electrode positions are selected. A significant increase in performance was found when using nodes with three electrodes over nodes with two electrodes. Conclusion: When the nodes are optimally placed, WESNs do not significantly suffer from EEG miniaturization effects in the case of AAD. Significance: WESN-like platforms allow us to achieve similar AAD performance as with long-distance EEG recordings while adhering to the stringent miniaturization constraints for ambulatory EEG. Their applicability in an AAD task is important for the design of neuro-steered auditory prostheses.

J	Cho, KO; Jang, HJ				Cho, Kyung-Ok; Jang, Hyun-Jong			Comparison of different input modalities and network structures for deep learning-based seizure detection	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ABERRANT HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; EPILEPTIC SEIZURE; EEG	The manual review of an electroencephalogram (EEG) for seizure detection is a laborious and error-prone process. Thus, automated seizure detection based on machine learning has been studied for decades. Recently, deep learning has been adopted in order to avoid manual feature extraction and selection. In the present study, we systematically compared the performance of different combinations of input modalities and network structures on a fixed window size and dataset to ascertain an optimal combination of input modalities and network structures. The raw time-series EEG, periodogram of the EEG, 2D images of short-time Fourier transform results, and 2D images of raw EEG waveforms were obtained from 5-s segments of intracranial EEGs recorded from a mouse model of epilepsy. A fully connected neural network (FCNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN) were implemented to classify the various inputs. The classification results for the test dataset showed that CNN performed better than FCNN and RNN, with the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristics curves ranging from 0.983 to 0.984, from 0.985 to 0.989, and from 0.989 to 0.993 for FCNN, RNN, and CNN, respectively. As for input modalities, 2D images of raw EEG waveforms yielded the best result with an AUC of 0.993. Thus, CNN can be the most suitable network structure for automated seizure detection when applied to the images of raw EEG waveforms, since CNN can effectively learn a general spatially-invariant representation of seizure patterns in 2D representations of raw EEG.

The modern deep learning algorithms can be used on large EEG data set after applying the data augmentation process on them. In this paper, we apply the Deep Belief Network (DBN) model based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for unsupervised feature learning of EEG signals to extract salient features for classification. This DBN model provides an unsupervised taxonomy-based system without human intervention. The efficiency of this model is evaluated on the ambulatory EEG signal with other deep learning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that DBN with Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (DBN-RNN-LSTM) provides an accuracy of 98.3% which is better than RNN-LSTM and other classical machine learning algorithm.

It is known that the brain controls the human voice. Therefore, there should be a relation between the characteristics of voice and brain activity. OBJECTIVE: In this research, electroencephalography (EEG) as the feature of brain activity and voice signals were simultaneously analyzed. METHOD: For this purpose, we changed the activity of the human brain by applying different odours and simultaneously recorded their voices and EEG signals while they read a text. For the analysis, we used the fractal theory that deals with the complexity of objects. The fractal dimension of EEG signal versus voice signal in different levels of brain activity were computed and analyzed. RESULTS: The results indicate that the activity of human voice is related to brain activity, where the variations of the complexity of EEG signal are linked to the variations of the complexity of voice signal. In addition, the EEG and voice signal complexities are related to the molecular complexity of applied odours. CONCLUSION: The employed method of analysis in this research can be widely applied to other physiological signals in order to relate the activities of different organs of human such as the heart to the activity of his brain.

While NF-EEG (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from EEG signals) has been explored for a very long time, NF-fMRI (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI signals) appeared more recently and provides more robust results and more specific brain training. Using fMRI and EEG simultaneously for bi-modal neurofeedback sessions (NF-EEG-fMRI, in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI and EEG) is very promising for the design of brain rehabilitation protocols. However, fMRI is cumbersome and more exhausting for patients. The original contribution of this paper concerns the prediction of bi-modal NF scores from EEG recordings only, using a training phase where EEG signals as well as the NF-EEG and NF-fMRI scores are available. We propose a sparse regression model able to exploit EEG only to predict NF-fMRI or NF-EEG-fMRI in motor imagery tasks. We compared different NF-predictors stemming from the proposed model. We showed that predicting NF-fMRI scores from EEG signals adds information to NF-EEG scores and significantly improves the correlation with bi-modal NF sessions compared to classical NF-EEG scores.

Various researchers have proposed different approaches to decode EEG signals for applications like spellers, emotion recognition, lie detection, brain games etc. The ability to analyze concealed behavior is very important for legal and security purposes. Method: This research aims to identify the concealed behavior of an individual. This paper presents a three-stage "Concealed Information Test" using wavelet transform, k-means clustering and multi-layer feed-forward neural network. The test has been developed by analyzing ERP component (P300) of EEG data during a mock crime scene. The wavelet transforms extracts time and frequency information from raw EEG data. K-means clustering clusters the wavelet coefficients into three clusters. As, neural network models the nonlinear time series data viz EEG, hence it has been utilized for classification of clustered data. Results: A hybrid 3-stage classification approach is proposed by combining the advantages of all above-mentioned approaches. EEG data is recorded for a "Concealed Information Test", for implementing the proposed framework. Conclusion: The performance of the proposed system is improved from existing approaches, by providing an accuracy of 83.1%.

Among the more common approaches to emotion detection are methods that rely on electroencephalography (EEG), facial image processing and speech inflections. Although eye-tracking is fast in becoming one of the most commonly used sensor modalities in affective computing, it is still a relatively new approach for emotion detection, especially when it is used exclusively. In this survey paper, we present a review on emotion recognition using eye-tracking technology, including a brief introductory background on emotion modeling, eye-tracking devices and approaches, emotion stimulation methods, the emotional-relevant features extractable from eye-tracking data, and most importantly, a categorical summary and taxonomy of the current literature which relates to emotion recognition using eye-tracking. This review concludes with a discussion on the current open research problems and prospective future research directions that will be beneficial for expanding the body of knowledge in emotion detection using eye-tracking as the primary sensor modality.

The EEG device can record the different rhythmic bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) as well as provide inertial sensing data (gyroscope and accelerometer) which was used as this study's dataset. Furthermore, this study uses virtual reality as the platform to deliver 360-video stimuli that were designed and stitched according to the Arousal-Valence Space (AVS) model which focuses on four emotions selected from each quadrant that were representative to these emotions namely happy, angry, boring and calm which encompasses the high and low arousal states and negative and positive valences. The dataset was then classified using Distributed Random Forest (DRF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Naive Bayes (NB). The performance of the classifiers were compared using the five rhythmic bands with and without the inertial sensing data. The study shows that in the subject-dependent approach, classification performance improved when inertial sensing data were included as additional sensor modalities to serve as input features in the dataset that was fed to the machine learning classifiers with GBM and NB obtained classification accuracy of 67.04% and 36.24% respectively, DRF achieved classification accuracy of 82.49%.

However, this type of deep learning models has not been tested on the classification of electrical brain waves (EEG) for brain computer interface (BCI) applications. For the first time, we propose a triplet network to classify motor imagery (MI) EEG signals. Stockwell Transform has been used for converting the EEG signals in the time domain into the frequency domain, which resulted in improved DML classification accuracy in comparison to DML with Short Term Fourier Transform (0.647 vs. 0.431). DML model was trained with a topogram of concatenated 64 EEG channel spectrograms. The training batch was comprised of triplet pairs of the anchor, positive, and negative labeled epochs. The triplet network was able to train an embedding feature space that minimized the Euclidean distance between the embeddings of spectrograms of the same class and increased the distance between the embeddings of different labeled images. The proposed method has been tested on an EEG dataset of 109 untrained subjects. We showed that the DML classifier is able to converge with an extremely small number of training samples (similar to 120 EEG trials) for only one subject per model, mitigating the well-known issue of the large inter-individual variability of human MI-BCI EEG which degrades the classification performance. The proposed preprocessing pipeline and the Triplet Network provide a promising method to classify MI-BCI EEG signals with much less training samples than the previous methods.

Therefore, it is meaningful to explore automatic cognitive load pattern recognition by using physiological measures. Firstly, this work extracted 33 commonly used physiological features to quantify autonomic and central nervous activities. Secondly, we selected a critical feature subset for cognitive load recognition by sequential backward selection and particle swarm optimization algorithms. Finally, pattern recognition models of cognitive load conditions were constructed by a performance comparison of several classifiers. We grouped the samples in an open dataset to form two binary classification problems: (1) cognitive load state vs. baseline state; (2) cognitive load mismatching state vs. cognitive load matching state. The decision tree classifier obtained 96.3% accuracy for the cognitive load vs. baseline classification, and the support vector machine obtained 97.2% accuracy for the cognitive load mismatching vs. cognitive load matching classification. The cognitive load and baseline states are distinguishable in the level of active state of mind and three activity features of the autonomic nervous system. The cognitive load mismatching and matching states are distinguishable in the level of active state of mind and two activity features of the autonomic nervous system.

In this work, we investigate several machine learning approaches to assess their performance in classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) data of TBI in a mouse model. Algorithms such as decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were analyzed based on their performance to classify mild TBI (mTBI) data from those of the control group in wake stages for different epoch lengths.

The performances of different machine learning techniques were compared, and the method to select linear continuous features for class interpolation was also explored. For the full-set features, the performances of different classifiers were satisfactory, with classification rates all above 90%. The LDA classifier had the best performance. The second best was the NB classifier, and the relatively worst was the KNN classifier. The linear continuous EEG features were selected by interpolation and can be found for all human subjects. Higher selection threshold led to less selected features but higher average performance of these features. In general, the EEG based machine learning methods can classify occupants' real-time thermal comfort states, and could potentially lead to more building energy saving through comfort-driven time varying set points.

Prior methods focus on linear analysis methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to establish a relationship. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework that is learned to maximize correlation. For dealing with high levels of noise in EEG data, we employ regularization techniques and experiment with various model architectures. With a paired dataset of audio envelope and EEG, we perform several experiments with deep correlation analysis using forward and backward correlation models. In these experiments, we show that regularized deep CCA is consistently able to outperform the linear models in terms of providing improved correlation (up to 9% absolute improvement in Pearson correlation which is statistically significant). We present an analysis that highlights the benefits of using dropouts for neural network regularization in the deep CCA model.

Many researchers in recent years have studied the non-invasive BCI systems. However, the efficiency of the intention decoding algorithm is affected by the random non-stationary and low signal-to-noise ratio characteristics of the EEG signal. Furthermore, channel selection is another important issue in BCI systems intention recognition. During intention recognition in BCI systems, the unnecessary information produced by redundant electrodes affects the decoding rate and deplete system resources. In this paper, we introduce a recurrent-convolution neural network model for intention recognition by learning decomposed spatio-temporal representations. We apply the novel Gradient-Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technology to the channel selection. Grad-CAM uses the gradient of any classification, flowing into the last convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map. Since the pixels of the localization map correspond to the spatial regions where the electrodes are placed, we select the channels that are more important for decision-making. We conduct an experiment using the public motor imagery EEG dataset EEGMMIDB. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an accuracy of 97.36% at the full channel, outperforming many state-of-the-art models and baseline models. Although the decoding rate of our model is the same as the best model compared, our model has fewer parameters with faster training time. After the channel selection, our model maintains the intention decoding performance of 92.31% while reducing the number of channels by nearly half and saving system resources. Our method achieves an optimal trade-off between performance and the number of electrode channels for EEG intention decoding. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesize that changes in Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), and Electroencephalography (EEG) correlated with clinical data and processed by artificial intelligence (AI) can indicate the development of imminent cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, respectively. This study aimed to develop a method that enables detection of imminent cerebral ischemia in unconscious patients, noninvasively and with the support of AI. Methods This prospective observational study will include patients undergoing elective surgery for carotid endarterectomy and patients undergoing acute endovascular embolectomy for cerebral arterial embolism. HRV, NIRS, and EEG measurements and clinical information on patient status will be collected and processed using machine learning. The study will take place at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Inclusion will start in September 2020, and patients will be included until a robust model can be constructed. By analyzing changes in HRV, EEG, and NIRS measurements in conjunction with cerebral ischemia or cerebral reperfusion, it should be possible to train artificial neural networks to detect patterns of impending cerebral ischemia. The analysis will be performed using machine learning with long short-term memory artificial neural networks combined with convolutional layers to identify patterns consistent with cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Discussion Early signs of cerebral ischemia could be detected more rapidly by identifying patterns in integrated, continuously collected physiological data processed by AI. Clinicians could then be alerted, and appropriate actions could be taken to improve patient outcomes.

Prediction methods, typically based on machine learning methods, require a large amount of data for training, in order to correctly classify seizures with small false alarm rates. Methods: In this work, we present a new database containing EEG scalp signals of 14 epileptic patients acquired at the Unit of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena, Italy. Furthermore, a patient-specific seizure prediction method, based on the detection of synchronization patterns in the EEG, is proposed and tested on the data of the database. The use of noninvasive EEG data aims to explore the possibility of developing a noninvasive monitoring/control device for the prediction of seizures. The prediction method employs synchronization measures computed over all channel pairs and a computationally inexpensive threshold-based classification approach. Results and conclusions: The experimental analysis, performed by inspection and by the proposed threshold-based classifier on all the patients of the database, shows that the features extracted by the synchronization measures are able to detect preictal and ictal states and allow the prediction of the seizures few minutes before the seizure onsets.

Brainwave monitoring outside the heavily equipped clinical environment demands a low-cost, portable, and wearable EEG system. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using an ambulatory EEG system to classify the stroke patient group with neurological changes due to ischemic stroke and the control healthy adult group. HealthSOS, a real-time health monitoring system for stroke prognostics, is proposed here, which consists of an eye-mask embedded portable EEG device, data analytics, and medical ontology based health advisor service. This system was investigated with 37 stroke patients (mean age 71.6 years, 61% male) admitted in the emergency unit of a hospital and 36 healthy elderly volunteers (mean age 76 years, 28% male). EEG was recorded in resting-state using the portable device with frontal cortical electrodes (Fp1, Fp2) embedded in an eye-mask within 120 h after the onset of symptoms of ischemic stroke (confirmed clinically). The EEG data acquisition of the left and right brain hemispheres was done for at least 15 minutes in the awake resting state while subjects laid down on the bed. The statistical result shows that the revised brain symmetry index (rsBSI), the delta-alpha ratio, and the delta-theta ratio of the stroke group differ significantly from those of the healthy control group. In the machine learning analysis, the support vector machine (SVM) model shows the highest accuracy (Overall accuracy: 92%) and the highest Gini coefficient (95%) in classification performance. This study will be useful for early stroke prognostics and the management of post-stroke treatment.

Understanding the haptic perception and cognition has become an exciting area in the technological, medical and psychophysical research. Neurohaptics has the potential to provide quantitative (objective) evaluation of the user haptic experience by directly measuring brain activities via EEG devices. In this study, we employed a Machine Learning (ML) based classifier model, namely the Radial Based Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) to select a few relevant Electroencephalography (EEG) channels and to detect the presence of tactile feedback during interaction with touch-screen devices using EEG data. To overcome the problem of limited training data, time-shifting is proposed as a method for data augmentation in time-series neural data which increased the classification accuracy. An experimental setup comprising an active touch task on the Tanvas touch-screen device is designed to evaluate the developed model. Results demonstrated that the middle frontal cortex, namely channels AF3, AF4, and F1 produced the best recognition rate of 85 +/- 3.3% in detecting the presence of the tactile feedback. This work is a step forward towards building a quantitative evaluation of tactile experience during haptic interaction.

Antidepressants are widely prescribed, but their efficacy relative to placebo is modest, in part because the clinical diagnosis of major depression encompasses biologically heterogeneous conditions. Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine-learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n = 309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.

J	Arnold, DH; Hohaia, W; Yarrow, K				Arnold, Derek H.; Hohaia, Wiremu; Yarrow, Kielan			Neural correlates of subjective timing precision and confidence	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TEMPORAL-ORDER JUDGMENT; HUMANS	Humans perceptual judgments are imprecise, as repeated exposures to the same physical stimulation (e.g. audio-visual inputs separated by a constant temporal offset) can result in different decisions. Moreover, there can be marked individual differences - precise judges will repeatedly make the same decision about a given input, whereas imprecise judges will make different decisions. The causes are unclear. We examined this using audio-visual (AV) timing and confidence judgments, in conjunction with electroencephalography (EEG) and multivariate pattern classification analyses. One plausible cause of differences in timing precision is that it scales with variance in the dynamics of evoked brain activity. Another possibility is that equally reliable patterns of brain activity are evoked, but there are systematic differences that scale with precision. Trial-by-trial decoding of input timings from brain activity suggested precision differences may not result from variable dynamics. Instead, precision was associated with evoked responses that were exaggerated (more different from baseline) similar to 300 ms after initial physical stimulations. We suggest excitatory and inhibitory interactions within a winner-take-all neural code for AV timing might exaggerate responses, such that evoked response magnitudes post-stimulation scale with encoding success.

The aim of this paper is to improve the performance of the conventional CSP method, which will be badly influenced by noises. The recently proposed quantized minimum error entropy (QMEE) criterion is applied to structure a new objective function instead of the L-2-norm in the conventional CSP. Quantization is utilized to reduce the computational complexity. The new objective function is optimized by a gradient-based iterative algorithm. The desirable performance of the QMEE-based CSP method, namely CSP-QMEE, is demonstrated with a toy example and two real EEG datasets, including Dataset IIb of the brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) Competition IV (three channels) and Dataset IIIa of the BCI Competition III (60 channels). The new method can achieve satisfactory performance compared to existing methods on all datasets. The promising results in this paper suggest that the CSP-QMEE may become a powerful tool for BCIs.

Frontal electroencephalogram based drug, sex, and age independent sedation level prediction using non-linear machine learning algorithms	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Anaesthesia; Electroencephalogram; Medical informatics; Consciousness Monitors; Machine learning		Brain monitors which track quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures to monitor sedation levels are drug and patient specific. There is a need for robust sedation level monitoring systems to accurately track sedation levels across all drug classes, sex and age groups. Forty-four quantitative features estimated from a pooled dataset of 204 EEG recordings from 66 healthy adult volunteers who received either propofol, dexmedetomidine, or sevoflurane (all with and without remifentanil) were used in a machine learning based automated system to estimate the depth of sedation. Model training and evaluation were performed using leave-one-out cross validation methodology. We trained four machine learning models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil, age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81-0.90). There were significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific. Nonlinear machine-learning models using quantitative EEG features can accurately predict sedation levels. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful reference for developing next generation EEG based sedation level prediction systems using advanced machine learning algorithms.	[Ramaswamy, S.

Due to the significant differences in EEG signals across subjects, and difficulty in collecting sufficient EEG samples for analysis during driving, detecting fatigue across subjects through using EEG signals remains a challenge. EasyTL is a kind of transfer-learning model, which has demonstrated better performance in the field of image recognition, but not yet been applied in cross-subject EEG-based applications. In this paper, we propose an improved EasyTL-based classifier, the InstanceEasyTL, to perform EEG-based analysis for cross-subject fatigue mental-state detection. Experimental results show that InstanceEasyTL not only requires less EEG data, but also obtains better performance in accuracy and robustness than EasyTL, as well as existing machine-learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK), and Domain-adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), etc.	[Zeng, Hong; Zhang, Jiaming; Li, Xiufeng; Kong, Wanzeng] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Hong; Kong, Wanzeng] Key Lab Brain Machine Collaborat Intelligence Zhe, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Zakaria, Wael] Ain Shams Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math Comp Sci, Cairo 11435, Egypt; [Babiloni, Fabio; Gianluca, Borghini] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Ind NeuroSci Lab, I-00161 Rome, Italy		Babiloni, F (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Ind NeuroSci Lab, I-00161 Rome, Italy.	jivon@hdu.edu.cn; 182050179@hdu.edu.cn; wael.zakaria@sci.asu.edu.eg; Correspondencefabio.babiloni@uniroma1.it; gianluca.borghini@uniroma1.it; lixiufengcn@hdu.edu.cn; kongwanzeng@hdu.edu.cn	Zakaria, Wael/AAU-7837-2021; Borghini, Gianluca/AAA-4687-2019; Babiloni, Fabio/E-5169-2015	Zakaria, Wael/0000-0001-6718-0980; Borghini, Gianluca/0000-0001-8560-5671; Babiloni, Fabio/0000-0002-4962-176X; Kong, Wanzeng/0000-0002-0113-6968	National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFE0118200]; NSFC [62076083]; Excellent Dissertation Cultivation Fund of Zhejiang Province [GK208802299013-101]; Graduate Scientific Research Foundation of Hangzhou Dianzi University [CXJJ2020086]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang [GK209907299001-008]	National Key R&D Program of China; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Excellent Dissertation Cultivation Fund of Zhejiang Province; Graduate Scientific Research Foundation of Hangzhou Dianzi University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang	This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China with grant No. 2017YFE0118200, NSFC with grant No. 62076083, Excellent Dissertation Cultivation Fund of Zhejiang Province with grant No. GK208802299013-101, the Graduate Scientific Research Foundation of Hangzhou Dianzi University with grant No. CXJJ2020086 and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang with grant No. GK209907299001-008.		42	5	5	32	54	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		1424-8220		SENSORS-BASEL	Sensors	DEC	2020	20	24							7251	10.3390/s20247251	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20247251			17	Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation	PL7LC	33348823	gold, Green Submitted, Green Published			2022-08-02	WOS:000603297500001

Changes in functional connectivity after theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-traumatic stress disorder: a machine-learning study	EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Theta burst; Delta; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Post-traumatic stress disorder	MAJOR DEPRESSION; MECHANISMS; MULTISITE; EFFICACY; OUTCOMES; TMS	Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a novel treatment approach for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and recent neuroimaging work indicates that functional connectivity profiles may be able to identify those most likely to respond. However, prior work has relied on functional magnetic resonance imaging, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Alternatively, electroencephalography (EEG) represents a different approach that may be easier to implement in clinical practice. To this end, we acquired an 8-channel resting-state EEG signal on participants before (n = 47) and after (n = 43) randomized controlled trial of iTBS for PTSD (ten sessions, delivered at 80% of motor threshold, 1,800 pulses, to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). We used a cross-validated support vector machine (SVM) to track changes in EEG functional connectivity after verum iTBS stimulation. We found that an SVM classifier was able to successfully separate patients who received active treatment vs. sham treatment, with statistically significant findings in the Delta band (1-4 Hz,p = 0.002). Using Delta coherence, the classifier was 75.0% accurate in detecting sham vs. active iTBS, and observed changes represented an increase in functional connectivity between midline central/occipital and a decrease between frontal and central regions. The primary limitations of this work are the sparse electrode system and a modest sample size. Our findings raise the possibility that EEG and machine learning may be combined to provide a window into mechanisms of action of TMS, with the potential that these approaches can inform the development of individualized treatment methods.

Here, we report the identification of two clinically relevant subtypes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) on the basis of robust and distinct functional connectivity patterns, prominently within the frontoparietal control network and the default mode network. We identified the disease subtypes by analysing, via unsupervised and supervised machine learning, the power-envelope-based connectivity of signals reconstructed from high-density resting-state electroencephalography in four datasets of patients with PTSD and MDD, and show that the subtypes are transferable across independent datasets recorded under different conditions. The subtype whose functional connectivity differed most from those of healthy controls was less responsive to psychotherapy treatment for PTSD and failed to respond to an antidepressant medication for MDD. By contrast, both subtypes responded equally well to two different forms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for MDD.

Given the debilitating effect of cybersickness on the user experience in VR, academic interest in the automatic detection of cybersickness from physiological measurements has crested in recent years. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been extensively used to capture changes in electrical activity in the brain and to automatically classify cybersickness from brainwaves using a variety of machine learning algorithms. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) algorithms and increasing availability of computational resources for DL have paved the way for a new area of research into the application of DL frameworks to EEG-based detection of cybersickness. Accordingly, this review involved a systematic review of the peer-reviewed papers concerned with the application of DL frameworks to the classification of cybersickness from EEC signals. The relevant literature was identified through exhaustive database searches, and the papers were scrutinized with respect to experimental protocols for data collection, data preprocessing, and DL architectures. The review revealed a limited number of studies in this nascent area of research and showed that the DL frameworks reported in these studies (i.e., DNN, CNN, and RNN) could classify cybersickness with an average accuracy rate of 93%. This review provides a summary of the trends and issues in the application of DL frameworks to the EEG-based detection of cybersickness, with some guidelines for future research.

J	Anupallavi, S; MohanBabu, G				Anupallavi, S.; MohanBabu, G.			A novel approach based on BSPCI for quantifying functional connectivity pattern of the brain's region for the classification of epileptic seizure	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Feature extraction; PLV (phase locking value); Bi-spectral phase concurrence index (BSPCI); Classification	EEG; PREDICTION; SYNCHRONY; COHERENCE; SPECTRA	Epilepsy seizure is brain neurological abnormality which arises from the sudden deviation of the electrical interaction in the brain. Electroencephalography (EEGs) are obtained from 22 subjects with epileptic seizure and non-epileptic seizure states recorded using 23 channels with a sampling frequency of 256 Hz. The functional connectivity of the brain region can be exacted from the features obtained from EEG signals by measuring phase locking value (PLV). The neuronal connection in the brain can be expressed in terms of phase synchrony. Despite of the fact that brain states should be characterize independently based upon its extracted features. Therefore, a novel functional connectivity index (FCI) feature is proposed, namely Bi-Spectral Phase Concurrence Index (BSPCI). It is used to represent the spectral information with third cumulant order correlation functions of the EEG signal. In this paper, three FCI features were measured namely, the magnitude's mean of the bi-spectral, the normalized entropy of bi-spectrum (NE1) and the normalized entropy of squared bi-spectrum (NE2) from the BSPCI. Rank sum test based on the Wilcoxon approach is used to find the set of statistical difference between quantitative features extracted from EEG signals. The results provide evidence that the FCI will have an impact in separating the difference among seizure states of various epileptic seizure patients. On the part of reducing a large number of the feature vector, feature selection is performed by utilizing the sequential forward selection method. PLV is measured for quantifying the obtained phase synchrony of EEG signal. For the classification of epileptic seizure, Support Vector Machine is utilized which gain a large accuracy for the proposed bi-spectral analysis method when compared with Incremental Gradient Descent (IGD), Logistic Regression (LR) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). The result is compared with IGD, LR, and MLP for obtaining better performance rate and the classification is 98.79% for the proposed work.

In this study, we analyzed natural grasp actions from EEG. Ten healthy subjects participated in this experiment. They executed and imagined three sustained grasp actions. We proposed a novel approach which estimates muscle activity patterns from EEG signals to improve the overall classification accuracy. For implementing, we have recorded EEG and electromyogram (EMG) simultaneously. Using the similarity of the estimated pattern from EEG signals compare to the activity pattern from EMG signals showed higher classification accuracy than competitive methods. As a result, we obtained the average classification accuracy of 63.89 +/- 7.54% for actual movement and 46.96 +/- 15.30% for motor imagery. These are 21.59% and 5.66% higher than the result of the competitive model, respectively. This result is encouraging, and the proposed method could potentially be used in future applications, such as a BCI-driven robot control for handling various daily use objects.

Here, we propose an end-to-end computational framework that assesses CE in near real-time, using electroencephalography (EEG) signals as objective measurements. The framework consists of i) a deep convolutional neural network that extracts task-discriminative spatiotemporal EEG features to predict the level of CE for two classes-cognitively engaged vs. disengaged; and ii) a novel sliding window method that predicts continuous levels of CE in short time intervals. We evaluated our framework on 8 healthy subjects using an in-house Go/No-Go experiment that adapted its gameplay parameters to induce cognitive fatigue. The proposed CNN had an average leave-one-subjectout accuracy of 88.19%. The CE prediction correlated well with a commonly used behavioral metric based on self-reports taken every 5 minutes (rho =0.93). Our results objectify CE measurement in near real-time and pave the way for using CE as a rehabilitation parameter for tailoring robotic therapy to each patient's needs and skills.

The features extracted from the method of DMD clearly capture the phase transition of a specific frequency among the channels corresponding to the ictal state and the channel corresponding to the interictal state, such as direct current shift (DC-shift or ictal slow shifts) and high-frequency oscillation (HFO). By performing classification tests with Electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings of one patient measured at different timings, it is shown that the captured phenomenon is the unique pattern that occurs in the ictal onset zone of the patient. We eventually explain how advantageously the DMD captures some specific characteristics to distinguish the ictal state and the interictal state. The method presented in this study allows simultaneous interpretation of changes in the channel correlation and particular information for activity related to an epileptic seizure so that it can be applied to identification and prediction of the ictal state and analysis of the mechanism on its dynamics.

J	Liu, YS; Huang, HP; Xiao, F; Malekian, R; Wang, WM				Liu, Yongshuang; Huang, Haiping; Xiao, Fu; Malekian, Reza; Wang, Wenming			Classification and recognition of encrypted EEG data based on neural network	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; Homomorphic encryption; Paillier; Neural network; Classification and recognition	MOVEMENT; BCI	With the rapid development of Machine Learning technology applied in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has emerged as a novel and convenient human-computer interaction for smart home, intelligent medical and other Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. However, security issues such as sensitive information disclosure and unauthorized operations have not received sufficient concerns. There are still some defects with the existing solutions to encrypted EEG data such as low accuracy, high time complexity or slow processing speed. For this reason, a classification and recognition method of encrypted EEG data based on neural network is proposed, which adopts Paillier encryption algorithm to encrypt EEG data and meanwhile resolves the problem of floating point operations. In addition, it improves traditional feed-forward neural network (FNN) by using the approximate function instead of activation function and realizes multi-classification of encrypted EEG data. Extensive experiments are conducted to explore the effect of several metrics (such as the hidden neuron size and the learning rate updated by improved simulated annealing algorithm) on the recognition results.

Resent researches prove that machine learning has a powerful ability to distinguish between minimally conscious state (MCS) and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS). What's more, convolutional neural network has made great progress in electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of other disorders. As a result, an improved 1D-convolutional neural network structure has been proposed for outcome prediction, using resting-state EEG signals from patients with disorders of consciousness. The model is established by training 690 EEG segments from 34 of MCS and 35 of UWS diagnosed by Coma Recovery Scale - Revised. The experimental results show that the accuracy, positive predictive value, specificity and sensitivity of the improved model in our research are 88.84%, 85.59%, 86.79% and 91.22%, respectively. It shows that our improved model has better performance than the model without Batch Normalization layer, as well as the model with deep graph convolutional neural network. The improved ID-convolutional neural network model in this study can be used as an auxiliary medical method for clinical diagnosis and detection of consciousness disorders. More profoundly, it could drive the development of robust expert systems in other neurological diseases.

J	Daoud, H; Bayoumi, M				Daoud, Hisham; Bayoumi, Magdy			Deep Learning Approach for Epileptic Focus Localization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Training; Surgery; Machine learning; Convolution; Brain modeling; Classification; clustering; convolutional autoen-coder; EEG; epileptic focus localization; variational autoencoder	DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION	The task of epileptic focus localization receives great attention due to its role in an effective epileptic surgery. The clinicians highly depend on the intracranial EEG data to make a surgical decision related to epileptic subjects suffering from uncontrollable seizures. This surgery usually aims to remove the epileptogenic region which requires precise characterization of that area using the EEG recordings. In this paper, we propose two methods based on deep learning targeting accurate automatic epileptic focus localization using the non-stationary EEG recordings. Our first proposed method is based on semi-supervised learning, in which a deep convolutional autoencoder is trained and then the pre-trained encoder is used with multi-layer perceptron as a classifier. The goal is to determine the location of the EEG signal that is responsible for the epileptic activity. In the second proposed method, unsupervised learning scheme is implemented by merging deep convolutional variational autoencoder and K-means algorithm for clustering the iEEG signals into two distinct clusters based on the seizure source. The proposed methods automate and integrate the features extraction and classification processes instead of manually extracting the features as done in the previous studies. Dimensionality reduction is achieved using the autoencoder, while the important spatio-temporal features are extracted from the EEG recordings using the convolutional layers. Moreover, we implemented the inference network of the semi-supervised model on FPGA. The results of our experiments demonstrate high classification accuracy and clustering performance in localizing the epileptic focus compared with the state of the art.

Furthermore, reliability of aEEG under real-life conditions is unknown.Methods:Participants were nurses from a 12-bed pediatric intensive care unit in a referral university hospital in France. Amplitude EEG was implemented after standardized training, including e-learning course, individual feedback and bedside teaching concerning monitoring installation, background classification patterns recognition, artefact analysis, and seizure detection. The primary judgment criterion was the agreement (Cohen Kappa) between nurses and aEEG experts for the detection of abnormal aEEG traces (moderately or severely altered background pattern according to Hellstrom-Westas classification and/or seizure activity).Results:During the study period, 196 consecutives traces from 79 patients were analyzed by 51 nurses. According to expert's classification, 53% of traces were abnormal, including 17.5% of severely abnormal traces (severely altered traces and/or seizure activity) and 14% exhibiting seizure activity. Moderate agreement between experts and nurses was found for detection of any abnormal trace (k = 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39-0.67). Substantial agreement was found for severely altered traces (k = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.57-0.85). Finally, fair agreement was found for seizure detection (irrespective of background classification, k = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.25-0.54).Conclusions:These results suggest that aEEG monitoring may be implemented in routine nursing care in pediatric intensive care unit. Further training courses are needed to enhance nurses' skill in detecting seizures activity at the bedside.

Brain activity processing is not a new topic: extensive research has been conducted over the last 50 years. However, the proposed solution brings novelty by its way of approaching the whole strategy, the greatest achievement of this research consisting of devising a composite brainwave processing-machine learning method capable to some extent of real-time detection of outstanding objects a person is viewing. Using, among others, preprocessing methods like DC offset removal, notch filtering, bandpass filtering, detrending, resampling and classifiers like SVM, neural networks, AdaBoost, nearest neighbors, an online prediction accuracy of 100% was obtained for a set of six colors and an offline prediction accuracy of 83.3% for a set of five scenes, for a single subject. The results of the study can be applied to the fields of neuro management and neuromarketing and other domains, a couple of possible scenarios being presented. (c) 2019 The Authors.

J	Ma, Z; Cheng, J; Tao, DP				Ma, Zheng; Cheng, Jun; Tao, Dapeng			Online learning using projections onto shrinkage closed balls for adaptive brain-computer interface	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Online learning; Projections; Wearable/portable brain computer interface; Electroencephalography; Event-related potential; Biometrics	BCI	Wearable/portable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the long-term end use are a focus of recent BCI research. A challenge is how to update the BCI to meet changes in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, since the resource are so limited that retraining of traditional well-performed models, such as a support vector machine, is nearly impossible. To cope with this challenge, less-demanding adaptive online learning can be considered. We investigated an adaptive projected sub-gradient method (APSM) that is originated from the set theoretic estimation formulation and the projections onto convex sets theory. APSM provides a unifying framework for both adaptive classification and regression tasks. Coefficients of APSM are adjusted online as data arrive sequentially, with a regularization constraint made by projections onto a fixed closed ball. We extended the general APSM to a shrinkage form, where shrinkage closed balls were used instead of the original fixed one, expecting a more controllable fading effect and better adaptability. The convergence of shrinkage APSM was proved. It was also demonstrated that as shrinkage factor approached to 1, the limit point of shrinkage APSM would approach to the optimal solution with the least norm, which could be especially beneficial for generalization of the classifier. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated, and compared with those of the general APSM, the incremental support vector machine, and the passive aggressive algorithm, through an event-related potential-based BCI experiment. Results showed the advantage of the proposed method over the others on both the online classification performance and the easiness of tuning. Our study revealed the effectiveness of the proposed method for adaptive EEG classification, making it a promising tool for on-device training and updating of wearable/portable BCIs, as well as for application in other related fields, such as EEG-based biometrics.

The recognition of personality profiles is crucial in making human-computer interaction (HCI) applications realistic, more focused, and user friendly. The ability to recognize personality using neuroscientific data underpins the neurobiological basis of personality. This paper aims to automatically recognize personality, combining scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and machine learning techniques. As the resting state EEG has not so far been proven efficient for predicting personality, we used EEG recordings elicited during emotion processing. This study was based on data from the AMIGOS dataset reflecting the response of 37 healthy participants. Brain networks and graph theoretical parameters were extracted from cleaned EEG signals, while each trait score was dichotomized into low- and high-level using the k-means algorithm. A feature selection algorithm was used afterwards to reduce the feature-set size to the best 10 features to describe each trait separately. Support vector machines (SVM) were finally employed to classify each instance. Our method achieved a classification accuracy of 83.8% for extraversion, 86.5% for agreeableness, 83.8% for conscientiousness, 83.8% for neuroticism, and 73% for openness.

Emerging matrix classifiers have been successfully applied to motor imagery (MI) EEG classification, but they belong to shallow classifiers, making powerful stacked generalization principle not exploited for automatically learning deep EEG features. To learn the high-level representation and abstraction, we proposed a novel deep stacked support matrix machine (DSSMM) to improve the performance of existing shallow matrix classifiers in EEG classification. Methods: The main idea of our framework is founded on the stacked generalization principle, where support matrix machine (SMM) is introduced as the basic building block of deep stacked network. The weak predictions of all previous layers obtained via SMM are randomly projected to help move apart the manifold of the original input EEG feature, and then the newly generated features are fed into the next layer of DSSMM. The framework only involves an efficient feed-forward rather than parameter fine-tuning with backpropagation, each layer of which is a convex optimization problem, thus simplifying the objective function solving process. Results: Extensive experiments on three public EEG datasets and a self-collected EEG dataset are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that our DSSMM outperforms the available state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: The proposed DSSMM inherits the characteristic of matrix classifiers that can learn the structural information of data as well as the powerful capability of deep representation learning, which makes it adapted to classify complex matrix-form EEG data.

J	Huang, WK; Xue, YH; Hu, LK; Liuli, HT				Huang, Wenkai; Xue, Yihao; Hu, Lingkai; Liuli, Hantang			S-EEGNet: Electroencephalogram Signal Classification Based on a Separable Convolution Neural Network With Bilinear Interpolation	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Convolution; Brain modeling; Feature extraction; Interpolation; Neural networks; Machine learning; Hilbert--Huang transform~(HHT); electroencephalogram~(EEG) classification; convolutional neural network~(CNN); bilinear interpolation	EMOTION RECOGNITION; SELECTION; TIME	As one of the most important research fields in the brain-computer interface (BCI) field, electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has a wide range of application values. However, for the EEG signal, it is difficult for the traditional neural networks to capture the characteristics of the EEG signal more comprehensively from the time and space dimensions, which has a certain effect on the accuracy of EEG classification. To solve this problem, we can improve the accuracy of classification via end-to-end learning of the time and space dimensions of EEG. In this paper, a new type of EEG classification network, the separable EEGNet (S-EEGNet), is proposed based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and a separable convolutional neural network (CNN) with bilinear interpolation. The EEG signal is transformed into time-frequency representation by HHT, which allows the EEG signal to be better described in the frequency domain. Then, the depthwise and pointwise elements of the network are combined to extract the feature map. The displacement variable is added by the bilinear interpolation method to the convolution layer of the separable CNN, allowing the free deformation of the sampling grid. The deformation depends on the local, dense, and adaptive input characteristics of the EEG data. The network can learn from the time and space dimensions of EEG signals end to end to extract features to improve the accuracy of EEG classification. To show the effectiveness of S-EEGNet, the team used this method to test two different types of EEG public datasets (motor imagery classification and emotion classification). The accuracy of motor imagery classification is 77.9%, and the accuracy of emotion classification is 89.91%, and 88.31%, respectively. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy of S-EEGNet improved by 3.6%, 1.15%, and 1.33%, respectively.

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution make MI-EEG decoding a challenging task. Recently, some deep neural approaches have shown good improvements over state-of-the-art BCI methods. In this study, an end-to-end scheme that includes a multi-layer convolution neural network is constructed for an accurate spatial representation of multi-channel grouped MI-EEG signals, which is employed to extract the useful information present in a multi-channel MI signal. Then the invariant spatial representations are captured from across-subjects training for enhancing the generalization capability through a stacked sparse autoencoder framework, which is inspired by representative deep learning models. Furthermore, a quantitative experimental analysis is conducted on our private dataset and on a public BCI competition dataset. The results show the effectiveness and significance of the proposed methodology.

EEG, which is a kind of complicated signal, can be used for epileptic seizure detection and epilepsy diagnosis via machine learning. A large amount of effort, including raw signal preprocessing and data preprocessing for machine learning, is required for constructing high-quality training datasets because the classification performance highly depends on high-quality data. Feature extraction has been widely used in EEG-based early epileptic seizure detection. Due to the complexity of data collection and labeling, some of the training instances are inevitably mislabeled. That means some similar instances have different labels. This is called the issue of class overlap, which leads to a poor class boundary for classification models and makes constructing a high-quality classification model more difficult. However, the previous studies investigating the impact of the class overlap for EEG data is quite limited. Our goal is to investigate the impact of the class overlap on EEG-based early epileptic seizure detection. We propose a special neighborhood cleaning rule (SNCR) to solve the class overlap issue. To alleviate the class overlap issue, we conduct large-scale experiments on two widely-used EEG datasets and compare our proposed SNCR strategy with a state-of-the-art data clean strategy, i.e., the improved k-means clustering cleaning approach (IKMCCA). The experimental results show that the classification model can achieve significantly better performance in terms of AUC, recall, and F1 metrics when using our proposed SNCR strategy. Therefore, for EEG-based early epileptic seizure detection, we recommend researchers to apply the SNCR strategy to mitigate the class overlap issue and use the SNCR strategy to perform data preprocessing in a future related study.

The design of the workstations was found to impair the performance, physical and mental health of employees. However, the mechanism underlying cognitive activity involved during workstation design-related stress effects in the PFC has not been fully understood. We used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to simultaneously measure electrical activity and hemoglobin concentration changes in the PFC. The multimodal signal was collected from 23 healthy adult volunteers who completed the Montreal imaging stress task in ergonomic and non-ergonomic workstations. A supervised machine learning method based on temporally embedded canonical correlation analysis (tCCA) was utilized to obtain the association between neural activity and local changes in hemoglobin concentrations to enhance localization and accuracy. The results showed deactivation in alpha power rhythms and oxygenated hemoglobin, as well as declined activation pattern of the fused data in the right PFC at the non-ergonomic workstation. Additionally, all participants at the non-ergonomic workstation experienced a substantial rise in salivary alpha-amylase activity in comparison with the ergonomic workstation, indicating the existence of high-stress levels. The proposed tCCA approach obtains excellent results in discriminating workstation types achieving accuracies of 98.8% and a significant improvement of 8.0% (p < 0.0001) and 9.4% (p < 0.0001) over EEG-only and fNIRS-only, respectively. Our study suggests the use of functional neuroimaging in designing the workplace as it provides critical information on the causes of workplace-related stress.

The BCI is based on biomarkers derived from spectral properties of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), subsequently classified by a linear discriminant analysis classifier. The BCI was trained on a visual WM task, tested in a real-time visual WM task, and further validated in a real-time cross task (mental arithmetic). Throughout each trial of the cross task, subjects were given real or sham feedback about their WM load. At the end of the trial, subjects were asked whether the feedback provided was real or sham. The high rate of correct answers provided by the subjects validated not only the global behaviour of the WM-load feedback, but also its real-time dynamics. On average, subjects were able to provide a correct answer 82% of the time, with one subject having 100% accuracy. Possible cognitive and motor confounding factors were disentangled to support the claim that our EEG-based markers correspond indeed to WM.

It mainly occurs in children of developing countries where health and nutritional requirements are questionable. This paper presents a machine learning classification approach to diagnose individuals suffering from IDD. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to capture information from the subject brain in the form of signals and processed further to diagnose the disorder. Data collected from 14 subjects (7 control and 7 disease affected) is used in this study. Signals are captured in rest condition and when subjects are listening to music. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) features are extracted from these EEG signals. These features are used by machine learning classifier to identify the disorder. Accuracy of 92.6% and 913% is achieved when subjects are listening to music and without music, respectively.

The performance of 5 different data sets combination classifications is studied using the probabilistic neural network (PNN), learning vector quantization neural network (LVQ) and Elman neural network (ENN). Different feature combinations serve as the input vectors of the classifiers to obtain the best outcomes. It has been found that PNN has less running time and provides better classification accuracy (CA) than ENN and LVQ classifiers for all 5 classification problems. It is worth noticing that the CA for the C-D classification task, which shows the status of pre-ictal versus post-ictal, has been greatly improved, and reached 83.13%. Hence, the epilepsy iEEG signals pattern recognition based on DWT statistical features using the PNN classifier is more suitable for forming a reliable, automatic classification system in order to assist doctors in diagnosis.

However, clinicians sometimes delay the initiation of this drug because of its adverse side-effects. Therefore, identification of predictive biomarkers of clozapine response is extremely valuable to aid on-time initiation of clozapine treatment. In this study, we develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm based on the pre-treatment electroencephalogram (EEG) data sets to predict response to clozapine treatment in TRS-SCZs, where the treatment outcome, after at least one-year follow-up is determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The ML algorithm has two steps: 1) an effective connectivity named symbolic transfer entropy (STE) is applied to resting state EEG waveforms, 2) the ML algorithm is applied to STE matrix to determine whether a set of features can be found to discriminate most responder (MR) SCZ patients from least responder (LR) ones. The findings of this study revealed that the STE features could achieve an accuracy of 89.90%. This finding implies that analysis of pre-treatment EEG could contribute to our ability to distinguish MR from LR SCZs, and that the STE matrix may prove to be a promising tool for the prediction of the clinical response to clozapine.

Analyzing the emotions using EEG signals plays a pivotal role in determining the internal/inner state of a particular human. EEG deals with the spontaneous electrical activity of neurons as recorded from multiple electrodes placed in the interior region of the brain. Initially, EEG signals are captured and preprocessed for the removal of noise signals. Selection of appropriate classification techniques in emotion analysis is an important task. The classifiers like k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), SVM, LDA were evaluated. Performances of the classifiers in analyzing a wide range of emotions (arousal and valence emotions) were examined. The results examined demonstrated that emotion analysis using EEG signals is highly advantageous and efficient than the existing traditional recognition systems.

The random vector functional link (RVFL) and extreme learning machine (ELM) are two popular randomized networks which provide us unified frameworks for both regression and multi-class classification. Currently, existing studies on RVFL and ELM focused mainly on supervised tasks even though we usually have only a small number of labeled samples but a large number of unlabeled samples. Therefore, it is necessary to make both models appropriately utilize both labeled and unlabeled samples; that is, we should develop their semi-supervised extensions. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization framework to semi-supervised RVFL and ELM networks. In the formulated JOSRVFL (jointly optimized semi-supervised RVFL) and JOSELM, the output weight matrix and the label indicator matrix of the unlabeled samples can be jointly optimized in an iterative manner. We provide a novel approach to optimize the JOSRVFL and JOSELM objective functions. Extensive experiments on benchmark data sets and Electroencephalography-based emotion recognition tasks showed the excellent performance of the proposed JOSRVFL and JOSELM models. Moreover, because the direct input-output connections help to regularize the randomization, JOSRVFL could obtain superior performance to JOSELM in most cases. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Calhas, D; Romero, E; Henriques, R				Calhas, David; Romero, Enrique; Henriques, Rui			On the use of pairwise distance learning for brain signal classification with limited observations	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Pairwise learning; Schizophrenia; Classification; Electroencephalography	NEURAL-NETWORKS; EEG	The increasing access to brain signal data using electroencephalography creates new opportunities to study electrophysiological brain activity and perform ambulatory diagnoses of neurological disorders. This work proposes a pairwise distance learning approach for schizophrenia classification relying on the spectral properties of the signal. To be able to handle clinical trials with a limited number of observations (i.e. case and/or control individuals), we propose a Siamese neural network architecture to learn a discriminative feature space from pairwise combinations of observations per channel. In this way, the multivariate order of the signal is used as a form of data augmentation, further supporting the network generalization ability. Convolutional layers with parameters learned under a cosine contrastive loss are proposed to adequately explore spectral images derived from the brain signal. The proposed approach for schizophrenia diagnostic was tested on reference clinical trial data under resting-state protocol, achieving 0.95 +/- 0.05 accuracy, 0.98 +/- 0.02 sensitivity and 0.92 +/- 0.07 specificity. Results show that the features extracted using the proposed neural network are remarkably superior than baselines to diagnose schizophrenia (+20pp in accuracy and sensitivity), suggesting the existence of non-trivial electrophysiological brain patterns able to capture discriminative neuroplasticity profiles among individuals.

J	Miao, MM; Hu, WJ; Yin, HW; Zhang, K				Miao, Minmin; Hu, Wenjun; Yin, Hongwei; Zhang, Ke			Spatial-Frequency Feature Learning and Classification of Motor Imagery EEG Based on Deep Convolution Neural Network	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							REAL	EEG pattern recognition is an important part of motor imagery- (MI-) based brain computer interface (BCI) system. Traditional EEG pattern recognition algorithm usually includes two steps, namely, feature extraction and feature classification. In feature extraction, common spatial pattern (CSP) is one of the most frequently used algorithms. However, in order to extract the optimal CSP features, prior knowledge and complex parameter adjustment are often required. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most popular deep learning models at present. Within CNN, feature learning and pattern classification are carried out simultaneously during the procedure of iterative updating of network parameters; thus, it can remove the complicated manual feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning methodology which can be used for spatial-frequency feature learning and classification of motor imagery EEG. Specifically, a multilayer CNN model is designed according to the spatial-frequency characteristics of MI EEG signals. An experimental study is carried out on two MI EEG datasets (BCI competition III dataset IVa and a self-collected right index finger MI dataset) to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison with several closely related competing methods. Superior classification performance indicates that our proposed method is a promising pattern recognition algorithm for MI-based BCI system.

It is also informing us of therapeutic interventions that will come about with such development. Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder in which functional changes may precede structural ones and which may be detectable using existing modalities. Methods: Functional connectivity analysis using electroencephalography (EEG) and resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has provided such meaningful input in cases of epilepsy. By leveraging the potential of autonomic edge computing in epilepsy, we develop and deploy both noninvasive and invasive methods for monitoring, evaluation, and regulation of the epileptic brain. First, an autonomic edge computing framework is proposed for the processing of big data as part of a decision support system for surgical candidacy. Second, a multimodal data analysis using independently acquired EEG and rs-fMRI is presented for estimation and prediction of the epileptogenic network. Third, an unsupervised feature extraction model is developed for EEG analysis and seizure prediction based on a Convolutional deep learning (CNN) structure for distinguishing preictal (pre-seizure) state from non-preictal periods by support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results: Experimental and simulation results from actual patient data validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Conclusions: The combination of rs-fMRI and EEG/iEEG can reveal more information about dynamic functional connectivity. However, simultaneous fMRI and EEG data acquisition present challenges. We have proposed system models for leveraging and processing independently acquired fMRI and EEG data.

The aim of this study was to develop a real-time, continuous physiological medical signal data acquisition system in seizure detection for intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: This prospective study was conducted in National Taiwan University Hospital from August 2018 to October 2019. This study included 20 patients who (a) had a sustained return of spontaneous circulation following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, (b) were over 18 years old, (c) and were admitted to the emergency ICU for post-cardiac-arrest care. One-lead electrocardiography and bilateral two-channel electroencephalography recorders were synchronically used to conduct measurements for a maximum of 72 hours. The recorded data were wirelessly real-time transmitted by a proxy transmitting module through an access point and a local gateway. A system with a novel algorithm processed the signals and conducted feature extraction and supervised learning for seizure detection. Results: A total of 89 nonseizure and 83 seizure events were detected by the system. Seizure occurred in two-thirds of the patients assessed by intensivists and neurologists. Four HRV parameters, namely standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-wave intervals, high frequency, low frequency-high frequency ratio, and sample entropy, were determined as potential features for identifying seizures. The sensitivity and specificity of the developed system were 0.74 and 0.81, respectively, and the positive predictive value was 0.82. Conclusion: The developed system can be used to identify seizure events through HRV features. Significance: The current study achieved real-time seizure detection and overcame previous limitations on continuity and accessibility.

We hypothesized that cortical dynamics involved in top-down regulation of postural responses carry information about directional postural changes (i.e., sway) imposed by sudden perturbations to standing balance (i.e., support surface translations). To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the single-trial classification of perturbation-induced directional changes in postural stability from high-density EEG. We analyzed EEG recordings from six young able-bodied individuals and three older individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke, which were acquired while individuals reacted to low-intensity balance perturbations. Using common spatial patterns for feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis or support vector machines for classification, we achieved classification accuracies above random level (p < 0.05; cross-validated) for the classification of four different sway directions (one vs. the rest scheme). Screening of spectral features (3-50 Hz) revealed that the highest classification performance occurred when low-frequency (3-10 Hz) spectral features were used. Strikingly, the participant-specific classification results were qualitatively similar between young able-bodied individuals and older individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Our findings demonstrate that low-frequency spectral components, corresponding to the cortical theta rhythm, carry direction-specific information about changes in postural stability. Our work presents a new perspective on the cortical representation of postural stability and the possible role of the theta rhythm in the modulation of (directional) reactive balance responses. Importantly, our work provides preliminary evidence that the cortical encoding of direction-specific changes in postural stability is present in chronic hemiparetic stroke.

Herein, we evaluate the potential of electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) for detecting in-flight changes in helicopter pilot workload. Two National Research Council Canada test pilots performed a series of flight maneuvers in an NRC Bell 205 helicopter which involved a target tracking task with three levels of difficulty. Subjective ratings of pilot workload were collected using the Cooper-Harper handling quality ratings scale and pilot control activity was quantified based on cyclic control movements. ECG derived measures of heart rate and heart rate variability, as well as EEG derived measures of power in three frequency bands (theta 4-8Hz; alpha 8-13Hz; beta 13-22Hz), were computed and compared across task difficulty levels. A set of support vector machine (SVM) regressors were trained and tested to differentiate the three difficulty levels from ECG and EEG features. Differences in subjective ratings and control activity metrics confirmed the task difficulty manipulations (p<0.01). ECG-derived physiological metrics were able to partially resolve differences among the task difficulty levels. Similarly, EEG-derived cognitive measures confirmed the capture of differential neural functioning levels for the task difficulty conditions in the alpha and beta bands (p<0.05), though substantial individual differences were observed between pilots. SVM regressors trained on ECG and EEG features successfully differentiated levels of workload, with the ECG-based regressor (minimum cross-validation MSEECG = 0.17) performing better than the EEG-based regressor (minimum cross-validation MSEEEG = 0.29). This study provides an initial application demonstration of physiological and cognitive metrics and machine learning approaches for detecting differences in task difficulty during helicopter flight. This is the necessary first step for further development of passive brain computer interfaces for real-time in-flight monitoring of helicopter pilot workload.

To date, relatively few studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have yielded consistent relations between personality trait measures and spectral power. Thus, new exploratory research may help develop targeted hypotheses about how neural processes associated with EEG activity may relate to personality differences. We used multivariate pattern analysis to decode personality scores (i.e., Big Five traits) from resting EEG frequency power spectra. Up to 8 minutes of EEG data was recorded per participant prior to completing an unrelated task (N = 168, M-age = 23.51, 57% female) and, in a subset of participants, after task completion (N = 96, M-age = 23.22, 52% female). In each recording, participants alternated between open and closed eyes. Linear support vector regression with 10-fold cross vali- dation was performed using the power from 62 scalp electrodes within 1 Hz frequency bins from 1 to 30 Hz. One Big Five trait, agreeableness, could be decoded from EEG power ranging from 8 to 19 Hz, and this was consistent across all four recording periods. Neuroticism was decodable using data within the 3-6 Hz range, albeit less consistently. Posterior alpha power negatively correlated with agreeableness, whereas parietal beta power positively correlated with agreeableness.

We design a deep CNN architecture for automated sleep stage classiffication of human sleep EEG and EOG signals. The CNN proposed in this paper amply outperforms recent work that uses a different CNN architecture over a single-EEG-channel version of the same dataset. We show that the performance gains achieved by our network rely mainly on network depth, and not on the use of several signal channels. Performance of our approach is on par with human expert inter-scorer agreement. By examining the internal activation levels of our CNN, we find that it spontaneously discovers signal features such as sleep spindles and slow waves that figure prominently in sleep stage categorization as performed by human experts.

However, due to the scarcity of MI commands and the long calibration time, using the MI-based BCI system in practice is still challenging. Zero-shot learning (ZSL), which can recognize objects whose instances may not have been seen during training, has the potential to substantially reduce the calibration time. Thus, in this context, we first try to use a new type of motor imagery task, which is a combination of traditional tasks and propose a novel zero-shot learning model that can recognize both known and unknown categories of EEG signals. This is achieved by first learning a non-linear projection from EEG features to the target space and then applying a novelty detection method to differentiate unknown classes from known classes. Applications to a dataset collected from nine subjects confirm the possibility of identifying a new type of motor imagery only using already obtained motor imagery data. Results indicate that the classification accuracy of our zero-shot based method accounts for 91.81% of the traditional method which uses all categories of data.

Aiming to achieve intelligent classification of EEG types with high accuracy, a classification methodology using sparse representation (SR) and fast compression residual convolutional neural networks (FCRes-CNNs) is proposed. In the proposed methodology, EEG waveforms of classes 1 and 2 are segmented into subsignals, and 140 experimental samples were achieved for each type of EEG signal. The common spatial patterns algorithm is used to obtain the features of the EEG signal. Subsequently, the redundant dictionary with sparse representation is constructed based on these features. Finally, the samples of the EEG types were imported into the FCRes-CNN model having fast down-sampling module and residual block structural units to be identified and classified. The datasets from BCI Competition 2005 (dataset IVa) and BCI Competition 2003 (dataset III) were used to test the performance of the proposed deep learning classifier. The classification experiments show that the recognition averaged accuracy of the proposed method is 98.82%. The experimental results show that the classification method provides better classification performance compared with sparse representation classification (SRC) method. The method can be applied successfully to BCI systems where the amount of data is large due to daily recording.

We developed a 3-dimensional BCI training platform and applied it to assist the user in performing more intuitive imagination in the visual motion imagery experiment. The experimental tasks were selected based on the movements that we commonly used in daily life, such as picking up a phone, opening a door, eating food, and pouring water. Nine subjects participated in our experiment. We presented statistical evidence that visual motion imagery has a high correlation from the prefrontal and occipital lobes. In addition, we selected the most appropriate electroencephalography channels using a functional connectivity approach for visual motion imagery decoding and proposed a convolutional neural network architecture for classification. As a result, the averaged classification performance of the proposed architecture for 4 classes from 16 channels was 67.50 (+/- 1.52) % across all subjects. This result is encouraging, and it shows the possibility of developing a BCI-based device control system for practical applications such as neuroprosthesis and a robotic arm.

The most commonly used test to diagnose epilepsy is electroencephalogram (EEG). A typical EEG recording lasts for 20 to 30 minutes; however, a specialist requires much more time to read it. Furthermore, no evidence was found in the literature on open-source systems for the cost-effective management of patient information using electronic health records (EHR) that adequately integrate EEG analysis for automatic identification of abnormal signals. Objective: To develop an integrated open-source EHR system for the management of the patients' personal, clinical, and EEG data, and for automatic identification of abnormal EEG signals. Methods: The core of the system is an EHR and telehealth service based on the OpenMRS platform. On top of that, we developed an intelligent component to automatically detect abnormal segments of EEG tests using machine learning algorithms, as well as a service to annotate and visualize abnormal segments in EEG signals. Finally, we evaluated the intelligent component and the integrated system using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics. Results: The system allowed to manage patients' information properly, store and manage the EEG tests recorded with a medical EEG device, and to detect abnormal segments of signals with a precision of 85.10%, a recall of 97.16%, and an accuracy of 99.92%. Conclusion: Digital health is a multidisciplinary field of research in which artificial intelligence is playing a significant role in boosting traditional health services. Notably, the developed system could significantly reduce the time a neurologist spends in the reading of an EEG for the diagnosis of epilepsy, saving approximately 65-75% of the time consumed. It can be used in a telehealth environment. In this way, the availability and provision of diagnostic services for epilepsy management could be improved, especially in developing countries where the number of neurologists is low.

As both signals reflect different neuronal pathways, a combination of parameters from both signals may provide broader information about the brain status during anesthesia. Appropriate parameter selection and combination to a single index is crucial to take advantage of this potential. The field of machine learning offers algorithms for both parameter selection and combination. In this study, several established machine learning approaches including a method for the selection of suitable signal parameters and classification algorithms are applied to construct an index which predicts responsiveness in anesthetized patients. The present analysis considers several classification algorithms, among those support vector machines, artificial neural networks and Bayesian learning algorithms. On the basis of data from the transition between consciousness and unconsciousness, a combination of EEG and AEP signal parameters developed with automated methods provides a maximum prediction probability of 0.935, which is higher than 0.916 (for EEG parameters) and 0.880 (for AEP parameters) using a cross-validation approach. This suggests that machine learning techniques can successfully be applied to develop an improved combined EEG and AEP parameter to separate consciousness from unconsciousness.

Although significant achievements have been achieved, multiple motor imagery decoding is still unsatisfactory. To deal with this challenging issue, firstly, a segment of electroencephalogram was extracted and preprocessed. Secondly, we applied a filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) with one-vs-rest (OVR) strategy to extract the spatio-temporal-frequency features of multiple MI. Thirdly, the F-score was employed to optimise and select these features. Finally, the optimized features were fed to the spiking neural networks (SNN) for classification. Evaluation was conducted on two public multiple MI datasets (Dataset IIIa of the BCI competition III and Dataset IIa of the BCI competition IV). Experimental results showed that the average accuracy of the proposed framework reached up to 90.09 & x0025; (kappa: 0.868) and 81.33 & x0025; (kappa: 0.751) on the two public datasets, respectively. The achieved performance (accuracy and kappa) was comparable to the best one of the compared methods. This study demonstrated that the proposed method can be used as an alternative approach for multiple MI decoding and it provided a potential solution for online multiple MI detection.

As a diagnostic support, the electroencephalogram is used, which is relatively easy to apply but requires a long time to analyze. Automatic EEG analysis presents difficulties both in the construction of the database and in the extracted characteristics used to build models. This article a machine learning-based methodology that uses a visual word bag of raw EEG images as input to identify images with abnormal signals. The performance introduces of the algorithms was tested using a proprietary pediatric EEG database. Accuracy greater than 95% was achieved, with calculation times less than 0.01 s per image. Therefore, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms to directly analyze EEG images.

EEG signals can be utilized as the driving source, and to implement natural human-like grasping abilities. Although good accuracy has already been achieved in classifying the various grasp patterns for specific sets of objects, unseen objects are still a hurdle in real-life implementation. Generalization of grasp patterns should be explored without any prior knowledge of the objects. In this regard, the similarity of motor imagery for different objects requiring similar grasp pattern can be utilized. It is also necessary to identify the brain regions that exhibit prominent distinguishability during different grasp patterns. In this study, we propose a chaos-based method to decode the motor imagery of two quite similar Power grasp patterns-cylindrical and spherical-for holding various objects. Three distinct suitable objects were chosen for each of the two patterns, and a 29-channel EEG was taken of 18 healthy participants to explore motor imagery for grasping the objects. Nonlinear correlation dimension was employed on the EEG data, at sub-band levels alpha, upper beta, and gamma, to analyse the distinguishability, as well as the similarity of grasp patterns for the objects. ANOVA was subsequently performed on the obtained CD parameters to identify the contribution of each electrode channel. Furthermore, using an SVM classifier, more than 80% accuracy was obtained in classifying the grasping patterns at the upper beta sub-band. The outcome may lead to identification of optimum feature sets of motor imagery from specific brain regions for random objects grasps.

Epileptic Seizure Detection in Clinical EEGs Using an XGboost-based Method	2020 IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SYMPOSIUM	IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium	DEC 05, 2020	Philadelphia, PA	IEEE, Temple Univ, Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Neural Engn Data Consortium, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Reg 2, Signal Proc Soc Philadelphia Sect		TUH-EEG Corpus; Seizure detection; Epilepsy; Machine learning	CLASSIFICATION	Epilepsy is one of the most common serious disorders of the brain, affecting about 50 million people worldwide. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method which is used to measure tiny electrical changes of the brain, and it is frequently used to diagnose epilepsy. However, the visual annotation of EEG traces is time-consuming and typically requires experienced experts. Therefore, automatic seizure detection can help to reduce the time required to annotate EEGs. Automatic detection of seizures in clinical EEGs has been limited-to date. In this study, we present an XGBoost-based method to detect seizures in EEGs from the TUH-EEG Corpus. 4,597 EEG files were used to train the method, 1,013 EEGs were used as a validation set, and 1,026 EEG files were used to test the method. Sixty-four features were selected as the input to the training set, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique was used to balance the dataset. Our XGBoost-based method achieved sensitivity and false alarm/24 hours of 20.00% and 15.59, respectively, in the test set. The proposed XGBoost-based method has the potential to help researchers automatically analyse seizures in clinical EEG recordings.

Insufficient operator attention accounted for more than 26% of the total causes of human errors and is the highest category for errors. It is therefore necessary to check whether operators are sufficiently attentive either as supervisors or peers during reactor operation. Recently, digital control technologies have been introduced to the operating environment of an NPP MCR. These upgrades are expected to enhance plant and operator performance. At the same time, because personal computers are used in the advanced MCR, the operators perform more cognitive works than physical work. However, operators may not consciously check fellow operators' attention in this environment indicating potentially higher importance of the role of operator attention. Therefore, remote measurement of an operator's attention in real time would be a useful tool, providing feedback to supervisors. The objective of this study is to investigate the development of quantitative indicators that can identify an operator's attention, to diagnose or detect a lack of operator attention thus preventing potential human errors in advanced MCRs. To establish a robust baseline of operator attention, this study used two of the widely used biosignals: electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movement. We designed an experiment to collect EEG and eye movements of the subjects who were monitoring and diagnosing nuclear operator safety-relevant tasks. There was a statistically significant difference between biosignals with and without appropriate attention. Furthermore, an average classification accuracy of about 90% was obtained by the k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine classifiers with a few EEG and eye movements features. Potential applications of EEG and eye movement measures in monitoring and diagnosis tasks in an NPP MCR are also discussed.

Variations in sensory-motor behavior can be caused by several factors, including changes in cognitive status and intrinsic neural variations in the brain. The correct identification of neural sources of behavioral variations is important for understanding the underlying neural mechanisms of sensory-motor behavior and for practical applications (e.g., the development of a precise brain-computer interface). However, studies on humans that investigate the neural sources of the trial-by-trial variation of the sensory-motor behavior are scarce. In this study, we explored the neural correlates of behavioral variations in smooth pursuit eye movements. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) activity from 15 participants while they performed a smooth pursuit eye movement task, wherein they tracked randomly selected visual motion targets that moved radially from the center of the screen. We isolated neural components that are specific to the trial-by-trial variation of smooth pursuit latency, speed, and direction using a novel multivariate pattern-analysis technique. We found that the phase of the spatially distributed multivariate theta oscillation was correlated with the trial-by-trial variation of pursuit latency and direction. This suggests that the changing patterns of the theta phase across EEG sensors can predict upcoming behavioral variations.

In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) showed adequate results in brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on different control signals, including event-related potentials (ERP). In this study, we propose a novel CNN, called EEG-Inception, that improves the accuracy and calibration time of assistive ERP-based BCIs. To the best of our knowledge, EEG-Inception is the first model to integrate Inception modules for ERP detection, which combined efficiently with other structures in a light architecture, improved the performance of our approach. The model was validated in a population of 73 subjects, of which 31 present motor disabilities. Results show that EEG-Inception outperforms 5 previous approaches, yielding significant improvements for command decoding accuracy up to 16.0%, 10.7%, 7.2%, 5.7% and 5.1% in comparison to rLDA, xDAWN + Riemannian geometry, CNN-BLSTM, DeepConvNet and EEGNet, respectively. Moreover, EEG-Inception requires very few calibration trials to achieve state-of-the-art performances taking advantage of a novel training strategy that combines cross-subject transfer learning and fine-tuning to increase the feasibility of this approach for practical use in assistive applications.

It plays an indispensable role in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. As manual sleep staging through well-trained sleep experts is time consuming, tedious, and subjective, many automatic methods have been developed for accurate, efficient, and objective sleep staging. Recently, deep learning based methods have been successfully proposed for electroencephalogram (EEG) based sleep staging with promising results. However, most of these methods directly take EEG raw signals as input of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without considering the domain knowledge of EEG staging. Apart from that, to capture temporal information, most of the existing methods utilize recurrent neural networks such as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) which are not effective for modelling global temporal context and difficult to train. Therefore, inspired by the clinical guidelines of sleep staging such as AASM (American Academy of Sleep Medicine) rules where different stages are generally characterized by EEG waveforms of various frequencies, we propose a multi-scale deep architecture by decomposing an EEG signal into different frequency bands as input to CNNs. To model global temporal context, we utilize the multi-head self-attention module of the transformer model to not only improve performance, but also shorten the training time. In addition, we choose residual based architecture which makes training end-to-end. Experimental results on two widely used sleep staging datasets, Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) and sleep-EDF datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness and significant efficiency (up to 12 times less training time) of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art.

Nevertheless, EEG currently has no established role in the clinical workup of individual patients. This opinion paper presents our critical view on why EEG has so far failed to keep its promise, and where we believe EEG will be clinically useful for patients threatened with cognitive decline in the future. Individual EEGs are an integral outcome of many causally intermixing upstream factors contributing to dementia. Therefore, EEG cannot become a clinically useful "simple" stand-alone biomarker of some pathognomic accumulations of specific brain proteins, but rather offer unique opportunities for more comprehensive and richly faceted insights into the functional status of brain systems. EEG may thus remain an essential window into the brain when it comes to the at-risk and presymptomatic phases of dementias, where it can be uniquely informative about concepts such as burdens of plasticity and repair, cognitive reserve, and sleep. Jointly with rapid gains in usability, portability, machine learning, closed loop systems, and understanding of the role of EEG-based sleep stages for memory and brain repair, EEG may come to keep its initial promise after all.

Such kind of system has become an alternative for interaction with the environment for people suffering from motor disabilities through the motor imagery (MI) paradigm. Despite being the most widespread, electroencephalography (EEG)-based MI systems are highly sensitive to noise and artifacts. Further, spatially close brain activity sources and variability among subjects hampers the system performance. This work proposes a methodology for the classification of EEG signals, termed Multiple Kernel Stein Spatial Patterns (MKSSP) dealing with noise, raveled brain activity, and subject variability issues. Firstly, a bank of bandpass filters decomposes brain activity into spectrally independent multichannel signals. Then, Multi-Kernel Stein Spatial Patterns (MKSSP) maps each signal into low-dimensional covariance matrices preserving the nonlinear channel relationships. The Stein kernel provides a parameterized similarity metric for covariance matrices that belong to a Riemannian manifold. Lastly, the multiple kernel learning assembles the similarities from each spectral decomposition into a single kernel matrix that feeds the classifier. Experimental evaluations in the well-known four-class MI dataset 2a BCI competition IV proves that the methodology significantly improves state-of-the-art approaches. Further, the proposal is interpretable in terms of data distribution, spectral relevance, and spatial patterns. Such interpretability demonstrates that MKSSP encodes features from different spectral bands into a single representation improving the discrimination of mental tasks.

People are motivated by both self-interest and a concern for the welfare of others. However, it remains unclear whether these motivations rely on similar neural computations, and the extent to which such computations influence social decision-making when self-fairness and other-fairness motivations compete. In this study, two groups of participants engaged in the role of responder in a three-party Ultimatum Game while being scanned with functional MRI (N = 32) or while undergoing high-density electroencephalography (N = 40). In both studies, participants accepted more OtherFair offers when they themselves received fair offers. Though SelfFairness was reliably decoded from scalp voltages by 170 ms, and from hemodynamic responses in right insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, there was no overlap between neural representations of fairness for self and for other. Distinct neural computations and mechanisms seem to be involved when making decisions about fairness in three-party contexts, which are anchored in an egocentric, self-serving bias.

Wireless electroencephalography (EEG) and wireless inertial measurement units (IMU) allow the realization of experimental data recording with improved ecological validity where the subjects can be carrying out natural activities while data recording is minimally invasive. Specifically, we aim to show that EEG and IMU data fusion allows improved human activity recognition in a natural setting. We have defined an experimental protocol composed of natural sitting, standing and walking activities, and we have recruited subjects in two sites: in-house (N = 4) and out-house (N = 12) populations with different demographics. Experimental protocol data capture was carried out with validated commercial systems. Classifier model training and validation were carried out with scikit-learn open source machine learning python package. EEG features consist of the amplitude of the standard EEG frequency bands. Inertial features were the instantaneous position of the body tracked points after a moving average smoothing to remove noise. We carry out three validation processes: a 10-fold cross-validation process per experimental protocol repetition, (b) the inference of the ethograms, and (c) the transfer learning from each experimental protocol repetition to the remaining repetitions. The in-house accuracy results were lower and much more variable than the out-house sessions results. In general, random forest was the best performing classifier model. Best cross-validation results, ethogram accuracy, and transfer learning were achieved from the fusion of EEG and IMUs data. Transfer learning behaved poorly compared to classification on the same protocol repetition, but it has accuracy still greater than 0.75 on average for the out-house data sessions. Transfer leaning accuracy among repetitions of the same subject was above 0.88 on average. Ethogram prediction accuracy was above 0.96 on average. Therefore, we conclude that wireless EEG and IMUs allow for the definition of natural experimental designs with high ecological validity toward human computational neuroethology research. The fusion of both EEG and IMUs signals improves activity and ethogram recognition.

EEG traits and age, sex, and personality traits were retrieved from a well-known dataset-AMIGOS-and two sets of traits were built to analyze the classification performance. We found that age, sex, and personality traits were not significantly associated with the classification of arousal, valence and discrete emotions using machine learning. The added EEG features increased the classification accuracies (compared with the original report), for arousal and valence labels. Classification of arousal and valence labels achieved higher than chance levels; however, they did not exceed 70% accuracy in the different tested scenarios. For discrete emotions, the mean accuracies and the mean area under the curve scores were higher than chance; however, F1 scores were low, implying that several false positives and false negatives were present. This study highlights the performance of EEG traits, age, sex, and personality traits using emotion classifiers. These findings could help to understand the traits relationship in a technological and data level for personalized human-computer interactions systems.

Brain Computer Interfaces BCI make decoding-encoding of brain signals into control instructions for external devices. This work proposes the use of stacked autoencoders and a softmax layer for classification of visual stimuli from Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals as an input to the BCI control system. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a good classification performance (average accuracy across subjects 0.95 +/- 0.05), compared to state-of-the-art approaches as Support Vector Machines SVM. Furthermore, the proposed network architecture allows analysis of the weights learned by the classifier making it possible to obtain insights of what signal features the classifier uses to discriminate the visual stimulus.

J	Chao, H; Liu, YL				Chao, Hao; Liu, Yongli			Emotion Recognition From Multi-Channel EEG Signals by Exploiting the Deep Belief-Conditional Random Field Framework	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Brain modeling; Emotion recognition; Feature extraction; Correlation; Hidden Markov models; Machine learning; Human-computer interaction; emotion recognition; multi-channel EEG signal; DBN-GC; conditional random field	FUSION	Recently, much attention has been attracted to automatic emotion recognition based on multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, with the rapid development of machine learning methods. However, traditional methods ignore the correlation information between different channels, and cannot fully capture the long-term dependencies and contextual information of EEG signals. To address the problems, this paper proposes a deep belief-conditional random field (DBN-CRF) framework which integrates the improved deep belief networks with glia chains (DBN-GC) and conditional random field. In the framework, the raw feature vector sequence is firstly extracted from the multi-channel EEG signals by a sliding window. Then, parallel DBN-GC models are utilized to obtain the high-level feature sequence of the multi-channel EEG signals. And the conditional random field (CRF) model generates the predicted emotion label sequence according to the high-level feature sequence. Finally, the decision merge layer based on K-nearest neighbor algorithm is employed to estimate the emotion state. According to our best knowledge, this is the first attempt that applies the conditional random field methodology to deep belief networks for emotion recognition. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available emotional datasets which include AMIGOS, SEED and DEAP. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can mine inter correlation information of multiple-channel by the glia chains and catch inter channel correlation information and contextual information of EEG signals for emotion recognition. In addition, the classification accuracy of the proposed method is compared with several classical techniques. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms most of the other deep classifiers. Thus, potential of the proposed framework is demonstrated.

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems have become more popular in recent years and are now being used for a variety of applications. BCI data represents an individual's brain activity at a given time. Like many other kinds of data, BCI data can be utilized for malicious purposes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most popular brain activity acquisition methods of BCI applications. More specifically, BCI games, represent one of the main EEG applications. However, a malicious BCI application (e.g. game) could allow an attacker to take advantage of an unsuspecting user happily enjoying a game and record the user's brain activity; by analyzing this data, the attacker can infer private information and characteristics regarding the user, without his/her consent or awareness. This study is the first to demonstrate the ability to predict and infer meaningful personality traits and cognitive abilities by analyzing resting-state EEG (rsEEG) recordings of an individual's brain activity using a variety of machine learning methods. A comprehensive set of raw rsEEG scans, along with the dissociation level and executive function (EF) performance measures, for the 162 subjects were used in our evaluation. The best results we achieved were an accuracy of 73% for dissociation classification and less than 16% mean absolute error in predicting performance for all examined EFs. These encouraging results are better than those presented in prior research, both in terms of accuracy and data-validity and dataset size. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The estimation of cognitive state based on the classification of the electroencephalograph (EEG) is a hot issue received more and more attention. So far, a variety of Deep Learning models have been raised, which has yielded improvements in feature extraction and classification. However, the existing models reveal shortcomings in processing spatial, spectral, and temporal features of the EEG. In this paper, we propose a deep hybrid Network called Ternary-task Convolutional Bidirectional Neural Turing Machine (TT-CBNTM) to perform cognitive state assessment. First, TT-CBNTM consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Neural Turing Machine (BNTM), of which CNN is applied to preserve the spatial and spectral representations of EEG, while the BNTM is applied to learn temporal representations from features which are extracted from the CNN. Second, we propose a new strategy called ternary-task regularization framework to induce the overfitting on the EEG database. The main task is to assess EEG-based cognitive workload through classification of EEG signals. The auxiliary tasks is identification and verification, through which we can increase the inter-class variations and reduce the intra-class variations, further lead to a better result of the EEG-based cognitive workload classification. The classication accuracy of our TT-CBNTM is 96.3 %, yielding 5 % improvement over the state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates the significant effectiveness of our approach which can be applied successfully to cognitive monitoring systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zheng, MM; Yang, BH; Xie, YL				Zheng, Minmin; Yang, Banghua; Xie, Yunlong			EEG classification across sessions and across subjects through transfer learning in motor imagery-based brain-machine interface system	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Motor imagery; Euclidean distance; Transfer learning; Paired t test; BCI	COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS; BCI; MOVEMENT; FILTERS	Transfer learning enables the adaption of models to handle mismatches of distributions across sessions or across subjects. In this paper, we proposed a new transfer learning algorithm to classify motor imagery EEG data. By analyzing the power spectrum of EEG data related to motor imagery, the shared features across sessions or across subjects, namely, the mean and variance of model parameters, are extracted. Then, select the data sets that were most relevant to the new data set according to Euclidean distance to update the shared features. Finally, utilize the shared features and subject/session-specific features jointly to generate a new model. We evaluated our algorithm by analyzing the motor imagery EEG data from 10 healthy participants and a public data set from BCI competition IV. The classification accuracy of the proposed transfer learning is higher than that of traditional machine learning algorithms. The results of the paired t test showed that the classification results of PSD and the transfer learning algorithm were significantly different (p = 2.0946e-9), and the classification results of CSP and the transfer learning algorithm were significantly different (p = 1.9122e-6). The test accuracy of data set 2a of BCI competition IV was 85.7% +/- 5.4%, which was higher than that of related traditional machine learning algorithms. Preliminary results suggested that the proposed algorithm can be effectively applied to the classification of motor imagery EEG signals across sessions and across subjects and the performance is better than that of the traditional machine learning algorithms. It can be promising to be applied to the field of brain-computer interface (BCI).

J	Tang, XL; Zhang, XR				Tang, Xingliang; Zhang, Xianrui			Conditional Adversarial Domain Adaptation Neural Network for Motor Imagery EEG Decoding	ENTROPY			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); motor imagery (MI); domain adaptation; signal classification; convolutional neural network		Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task because of the severe non-stationarity of perceptual decision processes. Recently, deep learning techniques have had great success in EEG decoding because of their prominent ability to learn features from raw EEG signals automatically. However, the challenge that the deep learning method faces is that the shortage of labeled EEG signals and EEGs sampled from other subjects cannot be used directly to train a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for a target subject. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel conditional domain adaptation neural network (CDAN) framework for MI EEG signal decoding. Specifically, in the CDAN, a densely connected ConvNet is firstly applied to obtain high-level discriminative features from raw EEG time series. Then, a novel conditional domain discriminator is introduced to work as an adversarial with the label classifier to learn commonly shared intra-subjects EEG features. As a result, the CDAN model trained with sufficient EEG signals from other subjects can be used to classify the signals from the target subject efficiently. Competitive experimental results on a public EEG dataset (High Gamma Dataset) against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in recognizing MI EEG signals, indicating its effectiveness in automatic perceptual decision decoding.

In medical practice, patients are diagnosed according to the criteria in standardized diagnostic manuals. The criteria for diagnosing such disorders focus on the symptoms presented by the patient as well as on disqualifying other potential causes of the symptoms. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that measures the electrical activity of the brain across different sites on the surface of the scalp. In this paper, 15 EEGs of depression patients and 15 EEGs of healthy control subjects are observed. The depressed and healthy subjects are paired according to age and gender to achieve a dataset that is balanced across classes, gender, and age of subjects. 475 different features are extracted from each EEG and used in the evaluation of different binary classification methods. The best F1-score of 0.7586 is achieved with the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. Sequential feature selection is performed, and sequentially selected features are used to evaluate the former binary classification methods. The best F1-score of 0.8750 is achieved with the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. Classification results are compared across different methods, as well as before and after excluding features that were not deemed significant by the sequential selection algorithm.

Continuous decoding of cognitive load from electroencephalography reveals task-general and task-specific correlates	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						cognitive load; mental effort; electroencephalography; cross-task; decoding; generalization	WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; WORKLOAD CLASSIFICATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA; THETA; ATTENTION	Objective. Algorithms to detect changes in cognitive load using non-invasive biosensors (e.g. electroencephalography (EEG)) have the potential to improve human-computer interactions by adapting systems to an individual's current information processing capacity, which may enhance performance and mitigate costly errors. However, for algorithms to provide maximal utility, they must be able to detect load across a variety of tasks and contexts. The current study aimed to build models that capture task-general EEG correlates of cognitive load, which would allow for load detection across variable task contexts.Approach. Sliding-window support vector machines (SVM) were trained to predict periods of high versus low cognitive load across three cognitively and perceptually distinct tasks: n-back, mental arithmetic, and multi-object tracking. To determine how well these SVMs could generalize to novel tasks, they were trained on data from two of the three tasks and evaluated on the held-out task. Additionally, to better understand task-general and task-specific correlates of cognitive load, a set of models were trained on subsets of EEG frequency features.Main results. Models achieved reliable performance in classifying periods of high versus low cognitive load both within and across tasks, demonstrating their generalizability. Furthermore, continuous model outputs correlated with subtle differences in self-reported mental effort and they captured predicted changes in load within individual trials of each task. Additionally, alpha or beta frequency features achieved reliable within- and cross-task performance, suggesting that activity in these frequency bands capture task-general signatures of cognitive load. In contrast, delta and theta frequency features performed considerably worse than the full cross-task models, suggesting that delta and theta activity may be reflective of task-specific differences across cognitive load conditions.Significance. EEG data contains task-general signatures of cognitive load. Sliding-window SVMs can capture these signatures and continuously detect load across multiple task contexts.

Previous studies on emotion recognition under sleep deprivation have been mainly based on psychological research techniques. In this paper, we introduce a multilayer weight sharing multimodal residual LSTM network for emotion recognition under sleep deprivation. The advantage of our proposed method is that it allows for the combination of three different features: the electroencephalography (EEG) single-channel differential entropy (DE) features, EEG functional strength features with topological correlation connectivity, and eye movement features. The experiments under the conditions of sleep deprivation, sleep recovery and baseline are designed and conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the performance compared with the simple concatenation of the features of different modalities, and the best mean accuracies of 86.86% and 82.03% are achieved for four emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, and neutral) in subject dependent and cross-subject emotion recognition tasks under 30 hours of sleep deprivation, respectively. The classification accuracy of the happiness emotion is obviously impaired under sleep deprivation, indicating that sleep deprivation impairs the stimulation of the happiness emotion, and one night of sleep recovery can reactivate the elicitation of the happiness emotion to the baseline level. Furthermore, we study the brain neural patterns of the four emotional states. The prefrontal area becomes less activated for the happiness emotion and sadness emotion in the gamma band under sleep deprivation, while the neural pattern of the fear emotion is highly robust with respect to sleep deprivation.

Dorsal Column Nuclei Neural Signal Features Permit Robust Machine-Learning of Natural Tactile- and Proprioception-Dominated Stimuli	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						feature learnability; neural prosthesis; supervised back-propagation artificial neural network; brain-machine interface; cuneate; gracile	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BACKGROUND FAST ACTIVITY; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; CUNEATE NUCLEUS; MOVEMENT; GRASP; MOTOR; EEG; ORGANIZATION; RESTORATION	Neural prostheses enable users to effect movement through a variety of actuators by translating brain signals into movement control signals. However, to achieve more natural limb movements from these devices, the restoration of somatosensory feedback is required. We used feature-learnability, a machine-learning approach, to assess signal features for their capacity to enhance decoding performance of neural signals evoked by natural tactile and proprioceptive somatosensory stimuli, recorded from the surface of the dorsal column nuclei (DCN) in urethane-anesthetized rats. The highest performing individual feature, spike amplitude, classified somatosensory DCN signals with 70% accuracy. The highest accuracy achieved was 87% using 13 features that were extracted from both high and low-frequency (LF) bands of DCN signals. In general, high-frequency (HF) features contained the most information about peripheral somatosensory events, but when features were acquired from short time-windows, classification accuracy was significantly improved by adding LF features to the feature set. We found that proprioception-dominated stimuli generalize across animals better than tactile-dominated stimuli, and we demonstrate how information that signal features contribute to neural decoding changes over the time-course of dynamic somatosensory events. These findings may inform the biomimetic design of artificial stimuli that can activate the DCN to substitute somatosensory feedback. Although, we investigated somatosensory structures, the feature set we investigated may also prove useful for decoding other (e.g., motor) neural signals.

Hybrid interfaces (hHMIs) represent a very recent solution to enhance the performance of single-signal approaches. These are classification approaches that combine multiple human-machine interfaces, normally including at least one BCI with other biosignals, such as the electromyography (EMG). However, their use for the decoding of gait activity is still limited. In this work, we propose and evaluate a hybrid human-machine interface (hHMI) to decode walking phases of both legs from the Bayesian fusion of EEG and EMG signals. The proposed hHMI significantly outperforms its single-signal counterparts, by providing high and stable performance even when the reliability of the muscular activity is compromised temporarily (e.g., fatigue) or permanently (e.g., weakness). Indeed, the hybrid approach shows a smooth degradation of classification performance after temporary EMG alteration, with more than 75% of accuracy at 30% of EMG amplitude, with respect to the EMG classifier whose performance decreases below 60% of accuracy. Moreover, the fusion of EEG and EMG information helps keeping a stable recognition rate of each gait phase of more than 80% independently on the permanent level of EMG degradation. From our study and findings from the literature, we suggest that the use of hybrid interfaces may be the key to enhance the usability of technologies restoring or assisting the locomotion on a wider population of patients in clinical applications and outside the laboratory environment.

Its accurate detection is a challenge since sometimes patients do not experience any prior alert to identify a seizure. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are used for seizure detection, but these are usually of longer duration, and as a result, the behavior of the inherent data set is highly imbalanced. To detect seizures in such a scenario is a challenging task; using a typical classifier such as decision tree and decision forest can result in highly skewed class value (non-seizure), causing incorrect detection of epileptic patients. To solve this, a cost-sensitive learning method with a random forest was used. An algorithm that helps in seizure detection by penalizing the cost of a false negative concerning the duration of an EEG recording was proposed. The experimental results show that executing the classifier without penalty or inadequate penalties to the cost matrix is not a satisfactory solution. As a result, the algorithm provides up to 100% recall, which means all the seizure seconds are detected. The proposed method substantiates achieving higher actual seizure detection rates; the imposed penalty should be equal to the time duration of the EEG recordings (in seconds) for a patient. Hence, it can be potentially applied to the pre-consultation to the neurologist at the Outpatient Department for the actual seizure detection cases and refer them to the neurology department for further consultation.

For complex multiclass MI-tasks, the number of activated dipoles is large, and the activation area, activation time and intensity are also different for different subjects. The means by which to identify fewer subject-based dipoles is very important. There exist two main methods of dipole selection: one method is based on the physiological functional partition theory, and the other method is based on human experience. However, the number of dipoles that are selected by the two methods is still large and contains information redundancy, and the selected dipoles are the same in both number and position for different subjects, which is not necessarily ideal for distinguishing different MI-tasks. In this paper, the data-driven method is used to preliminarily select fully activated dipoles with large amplitudes; the obtained dipoles are refined by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to best reflect the differences among the multiclass MI-tasks, thereby yielding a subject-based dipole selection method, which is named PRDS. PRDS is further used to decode multiclass MI-tasks in which some representative dipoles are found, and their wavelet coefficient power is calculated and input to one-vs.-one common spatial pattern (OVO-CSP) for feature extraction, and the features are classified by the support vector machine. We denote this decoding method as D-CWTCSP, which enhances the spatial resolution and also makes full use of the time-frequency-spatial domain information. Experiments are carried out using a public dataset with nine subjects and four classes of MI-tasks, and the proposed D-CWTCSP is compared with the relevant methods in sensor space and brain-source space in terms of the decoding accuracy, standard deviation, recall rate and kappa value. The experimental results show that D-CWTCSP reaches an average decoding accuracy of 82.66% among the nine subjects, which generates 8-20% improvement over other methods, thus reflecting its great superiority in decoding accuracy.

However, the major drawback in using EEG to accurately identify depression is the complexity and variation that exist in the EEG of a depressed individual. There are several strategies for automated depression diagnosis, but they all have flaws, which make the diagnostic task inaccurate. In this paper, a deep model is designed in which an integration of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is implemented for the detection of depression. CNN and LSTM are used to learn the local characteristics and the EEG signal sequence, respectively. In the deep learning model, filters in the convolution layer are convolved with the input signal to generate feature maps. All the extracted features are given to the LSTM for it to learn the different patterns in the signal, after which the classification is performed using fully connected layers. LSTM has memory cells to remember the essential features for a long time. It also has different functions to update the weights during training. Testing of the model was done by random splitting technique and obtained 99.07% and 98.84% accuracies for the right and left hemispheres EEG signals, respectively.

However, the active BCI paradigm is still underdeveloped with a lack of variety. It is imperative to adapt more voluntary mental activities for the active BCI control, which can induce separable electroencephalography (EEG) features. This study aims to demonstrate the brain function of timing prediction, i.e., the expectation of upcoming time intervals, is accessible for BCIs. Eighteen subjects were selected for this study. They were trained to have a precise idea of two sub-second time intervals, i.e., 400 ms and 600 ms, and were asked to measure a time interval of either 400 ms or 600 ms in mind after a cue onset. The EEG features induced by timing prediction were analyzed and classified using the combined discriminative canonical pattern matching and common spatial pattern. It was found that the ERPs in low-frequency (0 similar to 4 Hz) and energy in high-frequency (20 similar to 60 Hz) were separable for distinct timing predictions. The accuracy reached the highest of 93.75% with an average of 76.45% for the classification of 400 vs. 600 ms timing.

Decoding movement intention is one of the most significant aspects for performing arm movement tasks using brain signals. Decoding movement execution (ME) from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have shown high performance in previous works, however movement imagination (MI) paradigm-based intention decoding has so far failed to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this study, we focused on a robust MI decoding method with transfer learning for the ME and MI paradigm. We acquired EEG data related to arm reaching for 3D directions. We proposed a BCI-transfer learning method based on a Relation network (BTRN) architecture. Decoding performances showed the highest performance compared to conventional works. We confirmed the possibility of the BTRN architecture to contribute to continuous decoding of MI using ME datasets.

Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to randomly generate images in fashion, furniture and product design. However, such deep generative methods usually require a large number of training images and human aspects are not taken into account in the design process. In this work, we seek a way to involve human cognitive factors through brain activity indicated by electroencephalographic measurements (EEG) in the generative process. We propose a neuroscience-inspired design with a machine learning method where EEG is used to capture preferred design features. Such signals are used as a condition in generative adversarial networks (GAN). First, we employ a recurrent neural network Long Short-Term Memory as an encoder to extract EEG features from raw EEG signals; this data are recorded from subjects viewing several categories of images from ImageNet. Second, we train a GAN model conditioned on the encoded EEG features to generate design images. Third, we use the model to generate design images from a subject's EEG measured brain activity. To verify our proposed generative design method, we present a case study, in which the subjects imagine the products they prefer, and the corresponding EEG signals are recorded and reconstructed by our model for evaluation. The results indicate that a generated product image with preference EEG signals gains more preference than those generated without EEG signals. Overall, we propose a neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence design method for generating a design taking into account human preference. The method could help improve communication between designers and clients where clients might not be able to express design requests clearly.

Pain phenotypes classified by machine learning using electroencephalography features	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; MATRIX; INJURY; TESTS; THETA	Pain is a multidimensional experience mediated by distributed neural networks in the brain. To study this phenomenon, EEGs were collected from 20 subjects with chronic lumbar radiculopathy, 20 age and gender matched healthy subjects, and 17 subjects with chronic lumbar pain scheduled to receive an implanted spinal cord stimulator. Analysis of power spectral density, coherence, and phase-amplitude coupling using conventional statistics showed that there were no significant differences between the radiculopathy and control groups after correcting for multiple comparisons. However, analysis of transient spectral events showed that there were differences between these two groups in terms of the number, power, and frequency-span of events in a low gamma band. Finally, we trained a binary support vector machine to classify radiculopathy versus healthy subjects, as well as a 3-way classifier for subjects in the 3 groups. Both classifiers performed significantly better than chance, indicating that EEG features contain relevant information pertaining to sensory states, and may be used to help distinguish between pain states when other clinical signs are inconclusive.

Since degradation of attention can sometimes have dire consequences, various brain activity measurement devices such as electroencephalography (EEG) systems have been used to monitor attention states in individuals. However, conventional EEG instruments have limited utility in daily life because they are uncomfortable to wear. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the possibility of discriminating between the attentive and resting states using in-ear EEG signals for potential application via portable, convenient earphone-shaped EEG instruments. We recorded both on-scalp and in-ear EEG signals from 6 subjects in a state of attentiveness during the performance of a visual vigilance task. We have designed and developed in-ear EEG electrodes customized by modelling both the left and right ear canals of the subjects. We use an echo state network (ESN), a powerful type of machine learning algorithm, to discriminate attention states on the basis of in-ear EEGs. We have found that the maximum average accuracy of the ESN method in discriminating between attentive and resting states is approximately 81.16% with optimal network parameters. This study suggests that portable in-ear EEG devices and an ESN can be used to monitor attention states during significant tasks to enhance safety and efficiency.

In the electroencephalogram (EEG), MSEs are mainly characterized by a slowing in frequency. The identification of early signs of sleepiness and sleep (e.g. MSEs) is of considerable clinical and practical relevance. Under laboratory conditions, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) is often used for assessing vigilance. Methods: We analyzed MWT recordings of 76 patients referred to the Sleep-Wake-Epilepsy-Center. MSEs were scored by experts defined by the occurrence of theta dominance on >= 1 occipital derivation lasting 1-15 s, whereas the eyes were at least 80% closed. We calculated spectrograms using an autoregressive model of order 16 of 1 s epochs moved in 200 ms steps in order to visualize oscillatory activity and derived seven features per derivation: power in delta, theta, alpha and beta bands, ratio theta/(alpha + beta), quantified eye movements, and median frequency. Three algorithms were used for MSE classification: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and an artificial neural network (long short-term memory [LSTM] network). Data of 53 patients were used for the training of the classifiers, and 23 for testing. Results: MSEs were identified with a high performance (sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and Cohen's kappa coefficient). Training revealed that delta power and the ratio theta/(alpha + beta) were most relevant features for the RF classifier and eye movements for the LSTM network. Conclusions: The automatic detection of MSEs was successful for our EEG-based definition of MSEs, with good performance of all algorithms applied.

A deep CNN approach to decode motor preparation of upper limbs from time-frequency maps of EEG signals at source level	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Electroencephalography; Deep learning; Convolutional neural network; Time-frequency analysis; Beamforming	NEURAL-NETWORKS; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGERY; INTERFACES	A system that can detect the intention to move and decode the planned movement could help all those subjects that can plan motion but are unable to implement it. In this paper, motor planning activity is investigated by using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals with the aim to decode motor preparation phases. A publicly available database of 61-channels EEG signals recorded from 15 healthy subjects during the execution of different movements (elbow flexion/extension, forearm pronation/supination, hand open/close) of the right upper limb was employed to generate a dataset of EEG epochs preceding resting and movement's onset. A novel system is introduced for the classification of premovement vs resting and of premovement vs premovement epochs. For every epoch, the proposed system generates a time-frequency (TF) map of every source signal in the motor cortex, through beamforming and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), then all the maps are embedded in a volume and used as input to a deep CNN. The proposed system succeeded in discriminating premovement from resting with an average accuracy of 90.3% (min 74.6%, max 100%), outperforming comparable methods in the literature, and in discriminating premovement vs premovement with an average accuracy of 62.47%. The achieved results encourage to investigate motor planning at source level in the time-frequency domain through deep learning approaches. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Supervised and unsupervised machine learning for automated scoring of sleep-wake and cataplexy in a mouse model of narcolepsy	SLEEP			English	Article						animal models; EEG spectral analysis; narcolepsy; scoring; sleep in animals; machine learning	MICE; CLASSIFIER	Despite commercial availability of software to facilitate sleep-wake scoring of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) in animals, automated scoring of rodent models of abnormal sleep, such as narcolepsy with cataplexy, has remained elusive. We optimize two machine-learning approaches, supervised and unsupervised, for automated scoring of behavioral states in orexin/ataxin-3 transgenic mice, a validated model of narcolepsy type 1, and additionally test them on wild-type mice. The supervised learning approach uses previously labeled data to facilitate training of a classifier for sleep states, whereas the unsupervised approach aims to discover latent structure and similarities in unlabeled data from which sleep stages are inferred. For the supervised approach, we employ a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is trained on expert-labeled segments of wake, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep in EEG/EMG time series data. The resulting trained classifier is then used to infer on the labels of previously unseen data. For the unsupervised approach, we leverage data dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques. Both approaches successfully score EEG/EMG data, achieving mean accuracies of 95% and 91%, respectively, in narcoleptic mice, and accuracies of 93% and 89%, respectively, in wild-type mice. Notably, the supervised approach generalized well on previously unseen data from the same animals on which it was trained but exhibited lower performance on animals not present in the training data due to inter-subject variability. Cataplexy is scored with a sensitivity of 85% and 57% using the supervised and unsupervised approaches, respectively, when compared to manual scoring, and the specificity exceeds 99% in both cases. Statement of Significance This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first set of algorithms created to specifically identify pathological sleep in narcoleptic mice. Currently available sleep-scoring algorithms are trained on wild-type animals with normal sleep/wake behavior and exhibit low accuracies for scoring pathological sleep. Our supervised and unsupervised classifiers provide valuable tools that can greatly facilitate and expedite behavioral-state-scoring in narcoleptic mice. Both methods successfully score EEG/EMG data and can be manually corrected as necessary. All algorithms implemented in this work (including example datasets) can be made available upon request.

Resting-state EEG data were collected from 24 major depressive patients (MDD) and 29 normal controls using 128-electrode geodesic sensor net. To better identify depression, we extracted multi-type of EEG features including linear features (L), nonlinear features (NL), functional connectivity features phase lagging index (PLI) and network measures (NM) to comprehensively characterize the EEG signals in patients with MDD. And machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis were used to evaluate the EEG features. Combined multi-types features (All: L + NL + PLI + NM) outperformed single-type features for classifying depression. Analyzing the optimal features set we found that compared to other type features, PLI occupied the largest proportion of which functional connections in intra-hemisphere were much more than that of in inter-hemisphere. In addition, when using PLI features and All features, high frequency bands (alpha, beta) could achieve obviously higher classification accuracy than low frequency bands (delta, theta). Parietal-occipital lobe in the high frequency bands had great effect in depression identification. In conclusion, combined multi-types EEG features along with a robust classifier can better distinguish depressive patients from normal controls. And intra-hemispheric functional connections might be an effective biomarker to detect depression. Hence, this paper may provide objective and potential electrophysiological characteristics in depression recognition.

However, such an approach of feature extraction requires rigorous analysis and validation to develop an efficient machine-learning algorithm. The aim of this study is to classify rest and hand movements using the raw EEG signals and deep learning (DL) network. Healthy adult subjects age ranging 18-25 years performed hand movement four times each. The DL network was trained using subject-specifically with window sizes varying between 300ms and 1500ms. In the post-processing step, the majority voting scheme was employed. The results showed that the DL algorithm can predict the hand movement with more than 80% accuracy using 600ms or greater window size. The prediction accuracy is improved to more than 90% using the majority voting scheme. However, the window size of greater than 600ms did not significantly improve the accuracy values. When comparing between 300ms and 600ms window sizes, the accuracy increases from 77.5% to 82.7% (p<0.05). Such improvement was also reflected in both ROC curves and ranking analysis, where 600ms window size yielded higher AUC values and scores compared to the 300ms window size. The results of this study is valuable in human-computer interaction as well as in controlling devices including prosthesis, exoskeleton, virtual objects, computer typing, and wheelchair.

Due to its multifaceted aspects, including experiment design, stimuli selection and presentation of images other than feature extraction and selection techniques, foster its challenging nature. Although, researchers have focused various methods to create taxonomy of human brain activity, however use of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for image recognition to catalog the human brain activities is scarce. Moreover, experiment design is a complex procedure and selection of image type, color and order is challenging too. Thus, this research bridge the gap by using MVPA to create taxonomy of human brain activity for different categories of images, both colored and gray scale. In this regard, experiment is conducted through EEG testing technique, with feature extraction, selection and classification approaches to collect data from prequalified criteria of 25 graduates of University Technology PETRONAS (UTP). These participants are shown both colored and gray scale images to record accuracy and reaction time. The results showed that colored images produces better end result in terms of accuracy and response time using wavelet transform, t-test and support vector machine. This research resulted that MVPA is a better approach for the analysis of EEG data as more useful information can be extracted from the brain using colored images. This research discusses a detail behavior of human brain based on the color and gray scale images for the specific and unique task. This research contributes to further improve the decoding of human brain with increased accuracy. Besides, such experiment settings can be implemented and contribute to other areas of medical, military, business, lie detection and many others.

Inhibitory control, one facet of impulsivity, can be assayed using the stop-signal task (SST) and quantified behaviorally via the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) and electrophysiologically using event-related potentials (ERPs). Research on the relationship between alcohol use and SSRTs, and between alcohol use and inhibitory-control ERPs, is mixed. Here, adult alcohol users (n = 79), with a wide range of scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), completed the SST under electroencephalography (EEG) (70% of participants had AUDIT total scores greater than or equal to 8). Other measures, including demographic, self-report, and task-based measures of impulsivity, personality, and psychological factors, were also recorded. A machine-learning method with penalized linear regression was used to correlate individual differences in alcohol use with impulsivity measures. Four separate models were tested, with out-of-sample validation used to quantify performance. ERPs alone statistically predicted alcohol use (cross-validated r = 0.28), with both early and late ERP components contributing to the model (larger N2, but smaller P3, amplitude). Behavioral data from a wide range of impulsivity measures were also associated with alcohol use (r = 0.37). SSRT was a relatively weak statistical predictor, whereas the Stroop interference effect was relatively strong. The addition of nonimpulsivity behavioral measures did not improve the correlation (r = 0.34) and was similar when ERPs were combined with non-ERP data (r = 0.29). These findings show that inhibitory control ERPs are robustly correlated individual differences in alcohol use.

Motor imagery recognition is one part of BCI study in which several papers are published in this field. In this paper, four individual motor imagery (left and right hand, foot, and tongue) are classified by using visibility graph features of brain source dynamic which are extracted from EEG signals. In the proposed method, firstly EEG signals are recorded and preprocessed. Source localization algorithm (sLORETA in this paper) is applied to EEG signals and active sources during time are extracted. Then the multivariate autoregressive model (MVAR) is fitted to active sources and dual Kalman filter is applied to MVAR model for source dynamics and their relations estimation. Then extracted source dynamic signals are mapped to 5 different visibility graphs and some features are extracted from each graph. Extracted features number are reduced by analysis of variance (ANOVA) method and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are applied for motor imagery classification. In this research, the competition IV of BCI database was used and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a superior performance to the other methods. By classifying motor imaginary tasks with source dynamic signals better results with more accuracy and good performance measures are achieved in comparison with EEG signals classification by extracted from visibility graph gives better performance between graphs.

In order to obtain high performance, the algorithms need to enhance robustness or find class-discriminative bands for the spatial filter. However, the existing methods either cannot derive the spatial and spectral filters with a unique objective function for guaranteeing convergence or rarely consider the combined optimization of spatial-spectral filters and other patterns for enhancing the discrimination. In this study, we present a novel feature extraction method termed Spectrum-weighted Tensor Discriminant Analysis (SwTDA), which optimizes spectral filters along with spatial filters and other associated patterns by tensor-based discriminant analysis. The proposed method considers intrinsic spatial-spectral-temporal information contained by the physiological signal and hence can identify discriminative characteristics robustly. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods on two datasets involving 15 different subjects. Results indicate that the SwTDA method yields higher classification accuracies than the competing methods. Furthermore, interpretable spatial-spectral patterns that are determined by the algorithm can be used for further analysis of the MI-based EEG signal.

However, traditional biometric authentication systems (e.g., face recognition, iris, retina, voice, and fingerprint) are at increasing risks of being tricked by biometric tools such as anti-surveillance masks, contact lenses, vocoder, or fingerprint films. In this article, we design a multimodal biometric authentication system named DeepKey, which uses both Electroencephalography (EEG) and gait signals to better protect against such risk. DeepKey consists of two key components: an Invalid ID Filter Model to block unauthorized subjects, and an identification model based on attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to identify a subject's EEG IDs and gait IDs in parallel. The subject can only be granted access while all the components produce consistent affirmations to match the user's proclaimed identity. We implement DeepKey with a live deployment in our university and conduct extensive empirical experiments to study its technical feasibility in practice. DeepKey achieves the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 0 and 1.0%, respectively. The preliminary results demonstrate that DeepKey is feasible, shows consistent superior performance compared to a set of methods, and has the potential to be applied to the authentication deployment in real-world settings.

J	Ishizuka, K; Kobayashi, N; Saito, K				Ishizuka, Kazumi; Kobayashi, Nobuaki; Saito, Ken			High Accuracy and Short Delay 1ch-SSVEP Quadcopter-BMI Using Deep Learning	JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS AND MECHATRONICS			English	Article						quadcopter; steady state visually evoked potential; brain-machine interface; long short-term memory; convolutional neural network		This study considers a brain-machine interface (BMI) system based on the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) for controlling quadcopters using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. An EEG channel with a single dry electrode, i.e., without conductive gel or paste, was utilized to minimize the load on users. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, both of which have received significant research attention, were used to classify the EEG data obtained for flickers from multi-flicker screens at five different frequencies, with each flicker corresponding to a drone movement, viz., takeoff, forward and sideways movements, and landing. The subjects of the experiment were seven healthy men. Results indicate a high accuracy of 97% with the LSTM model for a 2 s segment used as the unit of processing. High accuracy of 93% for 0.5 s segment as a unit of processing can remain in the LSTM classification, consequently decreasing the delay of the system that may be required for safety reasons in real-time applications. A system demonstration was undertaken with 2 out of 7 subjects controlling the quadcopter and monitoring movements such as takeoff, forward motion, and landing, which showed a success rate of 90% on average.

Recent advances have been developed for the BCI-based drone control system as the demand for drone control increases. Especially, drone swarm control based on brain signals could provide various industries such as military service or industry disaster. This paper presents a prototype of a brain-swarm interface system for a variety of scenarios using a visual imagery paradigm. We designed the experimental environment that could acquire brain signals under a drone swarm control simulator environment. Through the system, we collected the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with respect to four different scenarios. Seven subjects participated in our experiment and evaluated classification performances using the basic machine learning algorithm. The grand average classification accuracy is higher than the chance level accuracy. Hence, we could confirm the feasibility of the drone swarm control system based on EEG signals for performing high-level tasks.

Dimensionality reduction is widely used in the visualization, compression, exploration and classification of data. Yet a generally applicable solution remains unavailable. Here, we report an accurate and broadly applicable data-driven algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The algorithm, which we named 'feature-augmented embedding machine' (FEM), first learns the structure of the data and the inherent characteristics of the data components (such as central tendency and dispersion), denoises the data, increases the separation of the components, and then projects the data onto a lower number of dimensions. We show that the technique is effective at revealing the underlying dominant trends in datasets of protein expression and single-cell RNA sequencing, computed tomography, electroencephalography and wearable physiological sensors.

J	Dong, EZ; Zhou, KR; Tong, JG; Du, SZ				Dong, Enzeng; Zhou, Kairui; Tong, Jigang; Du, Shengzhi			A novel hybrid kernel function relevance vector machine for multi-task motor imagery EEG classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Motor imagery EEG; Phase space reconstruction; Common spatial pattern; Hybrid kernel function; Relevance vector machine	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; PHASE-SPACE; PATTERNS; SIGNALS; SELECTION; FEATURES; TASK	Relevance vector machine (RVM) is a sparse Bayesian probability model commonly utilized in classification problems. Kernel functions are critical for the classification capacity of RVM. The kernel functions of RVM are not limited by the Mercer theorem, which differs RVM from the traditional support vector machine (SVM). As a typical local kernel function, the Gaussian kernel function has strong interpolating capacity, while the polynomial kernel function, a representative of global kernel function, is good at extrapolation. By combining the Gaussian kernel function and the polynomial kernel function, this paper proposed a novel hybrid kernel function RVM which is effective for classification at both local and global feature levels. Multi-task motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) classification is considered to validate the proposed method. Firstly, the phase space reconstruction (PSR) is employed to project EEG data from the time domain into the high-dimensional phase space, where the phase space common spatial pattern (PSCSP) features are extracted by using the "one versus one" common spatial pattern (OVO-CSP) strategy. Then the obtained PSCSP features are utilized as the input feature vectors of the proposed hybrid kernel function RVM for classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy and Kappa coefficient for the multi-task motor imagery EEG classification problem. The main contributions of the paper include the novel hybrid kernel function RVM and the PSCSP features extracted from EEG. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We decode the correlation among the brain and facial muscle activities during rest and visual stimulation. Fractal analysis is utilized to evaluate the alterations of complexity. In this study, we present different images with different complexities to participants and evaluate how complex structures of electromyography (EMG) signals and electroencephalography (EEG) signals are related. The findings indicate that the alteration of EMG signals' complexity was significant (Pvalue = .0001). Besides, more significant alterations in the EMG and EEG signals' complexities in response to the stimuli with higher complexities were observed. We conclude that the brain and facial muscles activities are related. We can analyze other physiological signals using this method to investigate their relationship with the brain.

This study aimed to elucidate the effectiveness of two non-linear measures, Higuchi's Fractal Dimension (HFD) and Sample Entropy (SampEn), in detecting depressive disorders when applied on EEG. HFD and SampEn of EEG signals were used as features for seven machine learning algorithms including Multilayer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines with the linear and polynomial kernel, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifier, discriminating EEG between healthy control subjects and patients diagnosed with depression. This study confirmed earlier observations that both non-linear measures can discriminate EEG signals of patients from healthy control subjects. The results suggest that good classification is possible even with a small number of principal components. Average accuracy among classifiers ranged from 90.24 to 97.56%. Among the two measures, SampEn had better performance. Using HFD and SampEn and a variety of machine learning techniques we can accurately discriminate patients diagnosed with depression vs controls which can serve as a highly sensitive, clinically relevant marker for the diagnosis of depressive disorders.

In these situations, most hearing-a bled individuals are able to focus on the auditory stimulus of their choice by filtering out other present auditory stimuli. This ability is also referred to as 'The Cocktail Party Effect'. Unfortunately, this ability is not yet applicable for people who use assistive listening devices or digital communications devices to communicate with more than one individual [I]. In this study, Spatial Release from Masking techniques are used within the context of its influence on Speech Intelligibility. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system was used to take electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, through noninvasive methods, for machine learning classification training. The goal of using EEG signals to train a machine learning classifier is to find a model that can accurately predict if a subject is listening to a particular auditory stimulus in the presence of multiple auditory stimuli. A similar study has been conducted before but without the use of machine learning for data processing [2].

In particular, applications for improving musical therapy via neurofeedback have shown promise for brain state optimization. Here, we propose a novel Humanistically Intelligent (HI) system where brain waves are interpreted by a real-time deep reinforcement learning agent that controls an audio modulation system in order for the user to achieve a target brain state. The modulated audio is then visualized using a simulated Sequential Wave Imprinting Machine (SWIM). In our tests comparing the proposed system to a conventional neurofeedback system, we found that the proposed system consistently led to a more meditative brain state with p = 0.06. We show that the proposed system is promising for brain state optimization tasks, advancing the intelligent utilization of EEG brain scan data in Humanistically Intelligent feedback loops.

The hardware circuit can acquire 8 channels of EEG data or expand to 32 channels. It is characterized in high accuracy, small size, and low power consumption, which can meet the needs of long-term bedside monitoring of newborns. Users can choose different modes to view the historical data of the acquired EEG signals, or real-time data transmitted via WiFi. To further analyze and process the data, this paper introduces a machine learning-based scheme to automatically distinguish between normal and abnormal amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) signals. The program extracts the effective feature representation from the data and trains the model. The model can predict the class of unknown aEEG samples, which is helpful for further clinical detection of neonatal brain conditions.

Method: Retrospective record analysis of children with lissencephaly presenting to tertiary health centre in Northern India was performed. Radiological classification and severity scoring were done. EEG findings were categorized into three patterns and its association with clinical severity was studied. Results: Twenty-eight children (males = 17) with lissencephaly were enrolled. Median age at diagnosis was 6.5months (range 3days-3years). Global developmental delay (median social quotient (SQ) = 25 (range15-68) was seen in all; motor deficits in 23 (82 %); epilepsy in 21 (75 %); behavioural problems in 18 (64 %); ophthalmic problems in 17 (61 %); microcephaly in 13 (46 %); feeding difficulty in 12 (43 %). Radiologically, classical Type I lissencephaly was seen in 18(64 %), cobblestone variant (Type II) in 5 (18 %) and micro-lissencephaly in 5 (18 %). Grade 4 (diffuse pachygyria) radiologic severity was most common (severity grade 1-6); no cases with severity score 5 or 6 were seen. The clinical profile did not correspond with radiological severity grading. EEG pattern recognition revealed pattern I in 14 (50 %); pattern II in 6 (21 %); pattern III in 8 (29 %). Children with pattern III EEG had drug resistant epilepsy and severe developmental delay. No relationship between EEG patterns and radiological severity grading was evident.

However, the regular brain computer interfaces (BCI) capturing the EEG signals usually require intrusive devices and cables linked to machines. Recently, some commercial low-intrusive BCI headbands have appeared, but with less electrodes than the regular BCIs. Some works have proved the ability of the headbands to detect basic motor imagery. However, all of these works have focused on the accuracy of the detection, using session sizes larger than 10 s, in order to improve the accuracy. These session sizes prevent actuators using the headbands to interact with the user within an adequate response time. In this work, we explore the reduction of time-response in a low-intrusive device with only 4 electrodes using deep learning to detect right/left hand motion imagery. The obtained model is able to lower the detection time while maintaining an acceptable accuracy in the detection. Our findings report an accuracy above 83.8% for response time of 2 s overcoming the related works with both low- and high-intrusive devices. Hence, our low-intrusive and low-cost solution could be used in an interactive system with a reduced response time of 2 s.

Walking is one of the most important actions that deals with the movement of the body. In fact, the brain controls and regulates human walking based on different conditions. One of the conditions that affects human walking is the complexity of path of movement. Therefore, the brain activity should change when a person walks on a path with different complexities. OBJECTIVE: In this research we benefit from fractal analysis to study the effect of complexity of path of movement on the complexity of human brain reaction. METHODS: For this purpose we calculate the fractal dimension of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal when subjects walk on different paths with different fractal dimensions (complexity). RESULTS: The results of the analysis show that the complexity of brain activity increases with the increment of complexity of path of movement. CONCLUSION: The method of analysis employed in this research can also be employed to analyse the reaction of the human heart and respiration when subjects move on paths with different complexities.

Emotion recognition has attracted increasingly intense interest from researchers from diverse fields. Human emotions can be recognized from facial expressions, speech, behavior (gesture/posture) or physiological signals. However, the first three methods can be ineffective since humans may involuntarily or deliberately conceal their real emotions (so-called social masking). The use of physiological signals can lead to more objective and reliable emotion recognition. Compared with peripheral neurophysiological signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals respond to fluctuations of affective states more sensitively and in real time and thus can provide useful features of emotional states. Therefore, various EEG-based emotion recognition techniques have been developed recently. In this paper, the emotion recognition methods based on multi-channel EEG signals as well as multi-modal physiological signals are reviewed. According to the standard pipeline for emotion recognition, we review different feature extraction (e.g., wavelet transform and nonlinear dynamics), feature reduction, and ML classifier design methods (e.g., k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)). Furthermore, the EEG rhythms that are highly correlated with emotions are analyzed and the correlation between different brain areas and emotions is discussed. Finally, we compare different ML and deep learning algorithms for emotion recognition and suggest several open problems and future research directions in this exciting and fast-growing area of AI.

J	Jayarathne, I; Cohen, M; Amarakeerthi, S				Jayarathne, Isuru; Cohen, Michael; Amarakeerthi, Senaka			Person identification from EEG using various machine learning techniques with inter-hemispheric amplitude ratio	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ASYMMETRY; BRAIN; IMAGERY; CORTEX; TASKS	Association between electroencephalography (EEG) and individually personal information is being explored by the scientific community. Though person identification using EEG is an attraction among researchers, the complexity of sensing limits using such technologies in real-world applications. In this research, the challenge has been addressed by reducing the complexity of the brain signal acquisition and analysis processes. This was achieved by reducing the number of electrodes, simplifying the critical task without compromising accuracy. Event-related potentials (ERP), a.k.a. time-locked stimulation, was used to collect data from each subject's head. Following a relaxation period, each subject was visually presented a random four-digit number and then asked to think of it for 10 seconds. Fifteen trials were conducted with each subject with relaxation and visual stimulation phases preceding each mental recall segment. We introduce a novel derived feature, dubbed Inter-Hemispheric Amplitude Ratio (IHAR), which expresses the ratio of amplitudes of laterally corresponding electrode pairs. The feature was extracted after expanding the training set using signal augmentation techniques and tested with several machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). Most of the ML algorithms showed 100% accuracy with 14 electrodes, and according to our results, perfect accuracy can also be achieved using fewer electrodes. However, AF3, AF4, F7, and F8 electrode combination with kNN classifier which yielded 99.0 +/- 0.8% testing accuracy is the best for person identification to maintain both user-friendliness and performance. Surprisingly, the relaxation phase manifested the highest accuracy of the three phases.

Accurate classification of MI is usually rather difficult to be achieved since mu rhythm is very weak and likely to be contaminated by other background noises. As an extension of the single layer feedforward network, extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently proven to be more efficient than support vector machine that is a benchmark for MI-related EEG classification. With probabilistic inference, this study introduces a sparse Bayesian ELM (SBELM)-based algorithm to improve the classification performance of MI. SBELM is able to automatically control the model complexity and exclude redundant hidden neurons by combining advantageous of both ELM and sparse Bayesian learning. The effectiveness of SBELM for MI-related EEG classification is validated on a public dataset from BCI Competition IV IIb in comparison with several other competing algorithms. Superior classification accuracy confirms that the proposed SBELM-based algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of an MI BCI.

Integration of these novel approaches in clinical practice depends on the availability of reliable, simple, and sensitive biomarkers of impairment level and extent of recovery, to enable an informed clinical-decision process. However, the neuropsychological tests currently in use do not tap into the complex neural re-organization process that occurs after brain insult and its modulation by treatment. Here we show that topographical analysis of resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) patterns using singular value decomposition (SVD) could be used to capture these processes. In two groups of subacute stroke patients, we show reliable detection of deviant neurophysiological patterns over repeated measurement sessions on separate days. These patterns generalized across patients groups. Additionally, they maintained a significant association with ipsilesional attention bias, discriminating patients with spatial neglect of different severity levels. The sensitivity and reliability of these rsEEG topographical analyses support their use as a tool for monitoring natural and treatment-induced recovery in the rehabilitation process.

EEG signals help to understand the physiological and functional details and activities of the brain. In the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning algorithms were useful in brain disorder detection and classification. Recently, a rapid increase in using Deep Learning (DL) methods in various applications in EEG signals not only helps in the detection of brain disorders but also facilitates the recognition of human emotions and various psycho-neuro disorders. In order to offer a beneficial and broad perspective, a detailed survey on the application of deep learning architecture in EEG signals has been carried out in this paper. Different deep learning methods, using varied architecture in EEG signal analysis, offer an understanding to develop the next level of AI-based systems. This review will provide information about how deep learning methods are used in EEG signals and the challenges and limitations of each method in classification; moreover making it helpful for those who are exploring EEG signals using DL algorithms.

The study employed 10 different FS algorithms to reduce the classification cost by using fewer features and to improve the classification performance of the model by removing the irrelevant features. In doing so, the classification performance of each FS algorithm on each EEG channel difference was also evaluated. The dataset used in the study included EEG measurements and visual EEG annotations that were recorded from 79 term neonates. Multiple features were extracted from each channel difference using the Feature extraction (FE). Subsequently, a novel feature subset was generated for the classification using FS algorithms. The classification performance of each selected feature was assessed based on multiple criteria. The use of features extracted by the combined use of FS algorithms showed higher performance compared to the use of all features. In this study, 18 channel differences were analyzed. Better performance was achieved by using 3 of the selected 14 features or 2 of the selected features. The C4-P4 channel difference showed the highest classification performance (98.8%) among all channel differences. In the literature, FE has already been performed for the classification of the dataset used in the present study. The primary aim of the present study was to perform the same classification with the minimum number of features. The results indicated that feature reduction reduced the cost and also improved the performance of the classification. These results seem to be highly promising and thus can be used in clinical practice and shed light for future studies.

Passing the test implies that some patterns of purely brain-based data directly correspond to the subjective features of phenomenal experience, which would help to bridge the explanatory gap between consciousness and brain. Here, we conducted the Dream Catcher test for the first time in a step-wise and simplified form, capturing its core idea. The Dream Catcher experiment involved a Data Team, which measured participants' brain activity during sleep and collected dream reports, and a blinded Analysis Team, which was challenged to predict, based solely on brain measurements, whether or not a participant had a dream experience. Using a serial-awakening paradigm, the Data Team prepared 54 1-min polysomnograms of non-rapid eye movement sleep-27 of dreamful sleep and 27 of dreamless sleep (three of each condition from each of the nine participants)-redacting from them all associated participant and dream information. The Analysis Team attempted to classify each recording as either dreamless or dreamful using an unsupervised machine learning classifier, based on hypothesis-driven, extracted features of electroencephalography (EEG) spectral power and electrode location. The procedure was repeated over five iterations with a gradual removal of blindness. At no level of blindness did the Analysis Team perform significantly better than chance, suggesting that EEG spectral power could not be utilized to detect signatures specific to phenomenal consciousness in these data. This study marks the first step towards realizing the Dream Catcher test in practice.

Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks Discriminate Adult ADHD From Healthy Individuals on the Basis of Event-Related Spectral EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deep learning; EEG; ERP; ADHD; neuroimaging; brain disease diagnosis	CLASSIFICATION; PREVALENCE; POTENTIALS; COMORBIDITY; INHIBITION; MODULATION; DIAGNOSIS; CHILDREN; BMD	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a four-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG time-frequency decompositions (spectrograms) of electroencephalography data (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) from ADHD patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) collected during the Flanker Task, with 2800 samples for each group. We treat the data as in audio or image classification approaches, where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. The model reaches a classification accuracy of 88% +/- 1.12%, outperforming the Recurrent Neural Network and the Shallow Neural Network used for comparison, and with the key advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. The event-related spectrograms also provide greater accuracy compared to resting state EEG spectrograms. Finally, through the use of feature visualization techniques such as DeepDream, we show that the main features exciting the CNN nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the delta-theta band around 100 ms for ADHD patients compared to healthy controls, suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with larger clinical samples is necessary, these results suggest that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, highlighting the potential of this methodology to develop biomarkers of practical clinical utility.

In a less controlled, more naturalistic environment, a larger variety of mental processes may be active and possibly interacting. When moving BCI applications from the lab to real-life applications, these additional unaccounted mental processes could interfere with user state decoding, thus decreasing system efficacy and decreasing real-world applicability. Here, we assess the impact of affective valence on classification of working memory load, by re-analyzing a dataset that used an affective N-back task with picture stimuli. Our analyses showed that classification of working memory load under affective valence can lead to good classification accuracies (> 70 percent), which can be further improved via data integration over time. However, positive as well as negative affective valence resulted in decreased classification accuracies, when compared to the neutral affective context. Furthermore, classifiers failed to generalize across affective contexts, highlighting the need for user state models that can account for different contexts or new, context-independent, EEG features.

In principle, it should be possible to use brain activity to directly control a therapeutic intervention in an interactive, closed-loop manner. But this raises the question as to whether the brain activity changes as a function of this interaction. Here, we used real-time decoded functional MRI responses from the insula cortex as input into a closed-loop control system aimed at reducing pain and looked for co-adaptive neural and behavioral changes. As subjects engaged in active cognitive strategies orientated toward the control system, such as trying to enhance their brain activity, pain encoding in the insula was paradoxically degraded. From a mechanistic perspective, we found that cognitive engagement was accompanied by activation of the endogenous pain modulation system, manifested by the attentional modulation of pain ratings and enhanced pain responses in pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray. Further behavioral evidence of endogenous modulation was confirmed in a second experiment using an EEG-based closed-loop system. Overall, the results show that implementing brain-machine control systems for pain induces a parallel set of co-adaptive changes in the brain, and this can interfere with the brain signals and behavior under control. More generally, this illustrates a fundamental challenge of brain decoding applications-that the brain inherently adapts to being decoded, especially as a result of cognitive processes related to learning and cooperation. Understanding the nature of these co-adaptive processes informs strategies to mitigate or exploit them.

For long-term recording of EEG signals, current research is heading towards simple, unobtrusive and ambulatory devices with a small number of channels. The primary contribution of this paper is to assess the performance difference between the seizure detection results using features from all channels versus only the channels in/around the temporal region. For this purpose, we develop a supervised seizure detection algorithm that uses time domain features extracted sequentially for every 1-second epoch. By using this algorithm, we obtained sensitivity values of 0.95 and 0.92, specificity values of 0.99 and 0.99 and false positive per hour values as 0.16 and 0.21 for all 23 channels and 10 temporal region channels, respectively. These results show that restricting the EEG analysis to temporal region results only in a graceful and gradual degradation of classifier performance. We conclude that EEG ambulatory devices with a montage local to the temporal region could demonstrate satisfactory performance. This presents a promising way forward for the use of ambulatory devices with compact wearable design.

We show that this is possible with the conventional event-related potential "subsequent-memory-effect" signals as well as with machine learning classifiers, but only to a small degree. This is in line with behavioral research, which supports many determinants of mem-ory apart from the cognitive processes during study.

Commercially available electroencephalograph (EEG)-based DoA monitors are recommended only for certain anesthetic drugs and specific age-group patients. This paper presents a machine learning classification processor for accurate DoA estimation irrespective of the patient's age and anesthetic drug. The classification is solely based on six features extracted from EEG signal, i.e., spectral edge frequency (SEF), beta ratio, and four bands of spectral energy (FBSE). A machine learning fine decision tree classifier is adopted to achieve a four-class DoA classification (deep, moderate, and light DoA versus awake state). The feature selection and the classification processor are optimized to achieve the highest classification accuracy for the state of moderate anesthesia required for the surgical operations. The proposed 256-point fast Fourier transform accelerator is implemented to realize SEF, beta ratio, and FBSE that enables minimal latency and high accuracy feature extraction. The proposed DoA processor is implemented using a 65 nm CMOS technology and experimentally verified using field programming gate array (FPGA) based on the EEG recordings of 75 patients undergoing elective surgery with different types of anesthetic agents. The processor achieves an average accuracy of 92.2% for all DoA states, with a latency of is The 0.09 mm(2) DoA processor consumes 140nJ/classification.

However, previous studies on machine-learning-based diagnosis of PTSD with resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) have reported poor accuracies of as low as 60%. Here, a Riemannian geometry-based classifier, the Fisher geodesic minimum distance to the mean (FgMDM), was employed for PTSD classification for the first time. Eyes-closed resting-state EEG data of 39 healthy individuals and 42 PTSD patients were used for the analysis. EEG source activities in 148 cortical regions were parcellated based on the Destrieux atlas, and their covariances were evaluated for each individual. Thirty epochs of preprocessed EEG were employed to calculate source activities. In addition, the FgMDM approach was applied to each EEG source covariance to construct the classifier. For a comparison, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classifiers employing source band powers and network features as feature candidates were also tested. The FgMDM classifier showed an average classification accuracy of 75.240.80%. In contrast, the maximum accuracies of LDA, SVM, and RF classifiers were 66.54 +/- 2.99%, 61.11 +/- 2.98%, and 60.99 +/- 2.19%, respectively. Our study demonstrated that the diagnostic accuracy of PTSD with resting-state EEG could be significantly improved by employing the FgMDM framework, which is a type of Riemannian geometry-based classifier.

Many BCIs are designed in a synchronous setting, which allows to output a command from the brain to the computer at pre-determined, specific time points. The task becomes substantially more demanding when designing asynchronous BCIs, which allow control over the interface at any given time. Most BCIs use static classifiers, in which the readout is driven only by the current input. However, due to the complex nature of ongoing brain activity, dynamic classifiers, which capture the temporal dynamics of the input signal, are likely to be more suitable for the task. To examine this notion, we designed a classification framework based on Echo State Networks (ESNs), which have demonstrated strong performance in similar tasks in other domains. We evaluated the performance of this approach on pre- recorded EEG data of an asynchronous motor imagery (MI) BCI task, and compared our approach to a conventional method. ESN-based architectures exhibited superior performance in comparison. Our findings suggest that ESNs may prove useful in other BCI paradigms in virtue of their ability to reduce the detrimental effect of non-stationarity in brain signals.

In the U.S., there are about 50,000 deaths annually related to TBI, and many others are permanently disabled. However, it is currently unknown which individuals will develop persistent disability following TBI and what brain mechanisms underlie these distinct populations. The pathophysiologic causes for those are most likely multifactorial. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as a promising quantitative measure for TBI diagnosis and prognosis. The recent rise of advanced data science approaches such as machine learning and deep learning holds promise to further analyze EEG data, looking for EEG biomarkers of neurological disease, including TBI. In this work, we investigated various machine learning approaches on our unique 24-hour recording dataset of a mouse TBI model, in order to look for an optimal scheme in classification of TBI and control subjects. The epoch lengths were 1 and 2 minutes. The results were promising with accuracy of similar to 80-90% when appropriate features and parameters were used using a small number of subjects (5 shams and 4 TBIs). We are thus confident that, with more data and studies, we would be able to detect TBI accurately, not only via long-term recordings but also in practical scenarios, with EEG data obtained from simple wearables in the daily life.

This paper proposes a novel automatic epileptic EEG classification approach based on differential entropy and attention mechanism, aiming at designing a short-term epileptic EEG classification model with high accuracy and good generalization performance. Firstly, the original EEG recordings are decomposed into five sub-frequency bands which approximately obey the Gaussian distribution. Afterward, a improved attention model framework considering both row and column attention with a shallower VGGNet (AttVGGNet-RC) is put forward as the classifier. Finally, non-patient specific method is employed to evaluate the performance with pre-tuned hypermeters. With 8-fold data, the proposed model yielded 77.33 +/- 2.91% sensitivity, 86.67 +/- 3.70% specificity and 82.00 +/- 1.43% accuracy, and accuracy was increased by 5.34%, 8.99%, 26.24% and 4.47% respectively compared with multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). With 10-fold shuffled data, the improved attention model yielded 93.84 +/- 0.63% sensitivity, 95.84 +/- 0.74% specificity and 95.12 +/- 0.20% accuracy, and the accuracy was 1.34%, 16.29%, 27.12% and 8.24% higher than MLP, ELM, SVM and LSTM respectively. The experimental result showed that the attention model achieved high classification accuracy with low standard deviation as well as good generalization performance. Furthermore, compared with state-of-art epilepsy analysis system, the proposed approach also show better performance. Therefore, this study has significant clinical application value in epilepsy analysis.

Different types of facial expression including eye wink, smile, eye blink, looking up and looking down can be extracted from the brain signal. In this study, the possibility of controlling assistive devices using the individual's wink has been investigated. Brain signals from the five subjects have been captured to recognize the left wink, right wink, and no wink. The brain signals have been captured using Emotiv Insight which consists of five channels. Fast Fourier transform and the sample range have been computed to extract the features. The extracted features have been classified with the help of different machine learning algorithms. Here, support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) have been employed to classify the features sets. The performance of the classifier in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, true positive and false positive rate and the area under curve (AUC)-receiver operating characteristics (ROC) have been evaluated. In the case of sample range, the highest training and testing accuracies are 98.9% and 96.7% respectively which have been achieved by two classifiers namely, SVM and K-NN. The achieved results indicate that the person's wink can be utilized in controlling assistive devices.

It is generally assumed that CFC can play a crucial role in perception, memory, and attention. In this study, two new indices for evaluating frequency-amplitude coupling (FAC) through generalized linear model (GLM) and linear regression method were introduced and investigated along with other CFC indices. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded during covert visual attention tasks to find out the CFC index capability so as to distinguish different states in the mentioned tasks. To this end, machine learning algorithms were used and four various types of CFC, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), phase-phase coupling (PPC), amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), and frequency-amplitude coupling (FAC) in recorded signals were considered as inputs for classifiers. The results demonstrated that the proposed method used for evaluating FAC through linear regression can provide more information about the different states in two covert attention tasks using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) by classification performance of 94.21% and 90.54% in color and direction tasks, respectively. Also, FAC that used a GLM model and PAC had a higher performance compared with PPC and AAC in color task (90.74 and 92.24% against 83.21 and 86.22). We can conclude that CFC can encompass useful information about semantic category of stimuli in covert attention tasks and can be used as an acceptable alternative for the time-frequency features of brain signals.

However, up to 30% of users may not develop enough coordination skills after training sessions because of inter and intra-subject variability. Here, we develop a data-driven estimator, termed Deep Regression Network (DRN), which jointly extracts and performs the regression analysis in order to assess the efficiency of the individual brain networks in practicing MI tasks. The proposed double-stage estimator initially learns a pool of deep patterns, extracted from the input data, in order to feed a neural regression model, allowing for infering the distinctiveness between subject assemblies having similar variability. The results, which were obtained on real-world MI data, prove that the DRN estimator fosters pre-training neural desynchronization and initial training synchronization to predict the bi-class accuracy response, thus providing a better understanding of the Brain-Computer Interface inefficiency of subjects.

It is mostly characterized by non-motor symptoms like fatigue, dementia, anxiety, speech and communication problems, depression, and so on. Electroencephalography (EEG) play a key role in the detection of the true emotional state of a person. Various studies have been proposed for the detection of emotional impairment in PD using filtering, Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, and non-linear methods. However, these methods require a selection of basis and are confined in terms of accuracy. In this paper, tunable Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is proposed for the classification of emotions in PD and normal controls (NC). EEG signals of six emotional states namely happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust are studied. Power, entropy, and statistical moments based features are elicited from the highpass and lowpass sub-bands of TQWT. Six features selected by statistical analysis are classified with a k-nearest neighbor, probabilistic neural network, random forest, decision tree, and extreme learning machine. Three performance measures are obtained, maximum mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.16%, 97.59%, and 88.51% for NC and 93.88%, 96.33%, and 81.67% for PD are achieved with a probabilistic neural network. The proposed method proved to be very effective such that it classifies emotions in PD and could be used as a potential tool for diagnosing emotional impairment in hospitals.

Various supervised and unsupervised models have been developed for sleep stage classification. Emphasis of those models has been on classifying sleep stages using deep learning models such as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), however, very limited work exists on interpreting those CNN filters learned from EEG data in a supervised manner. This paper focuses on investigating and interpreting the output filters of the first CNN layer of the DeepSleepNet model, which is a model developed for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw Single-Channel EEG. Experiments were carried out using a public benchmark dataset, namely the Sleep EDF Database. Spectral properties of both EEG epoch (input) and the learned filters obtained from the first CNN layer were compared. Results showed similar spectral properties between sleep EEG patterns and the learned filters which were obtained from the first CNN layer, and these findings suggest that 'sleep stage'-defining EEG patterns are associated with certain learned CNN filters.

Unimanual and Bimanual Reach-and-Grasp Actions Can Be Decoded From Human EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Task analysis; Extraterrestrial measurements; Grasping; Time-domain analysis; Decoding; Muscles; Unimanual reach-and-grasp action; bimanual reach-and-grasp action; movement-related cortical potential; grasp decoding; brain-computer interface; electroencephalogram (EEG)	CORTICAL POTENTIALS; MOTOR IMAGERY; BRAIN; STIMULATION	While most tasks of daily life can be handled through a small number of different grasps, many tasks require the action of both hands. In these bimanual tasks, the second hand has either a supporting role (e.g. for fixating a jar) or a more active role (e.g. grasping a pot on both handles). In this study we attempt to discriminate the neural correlates of unimanual (performed with left and right hand) from bimanual reach-and-grasp actions using the low-frequency time-domain electroencephalogram (EEG). In a self-initiated movement task, 15 healthy participants were asked to perform unimanual (palmar and lateral grasps with left and right hand) and bimanual (double lateral, mixed palmar/lateral) reach-and-grasps on objects of daily life. Using EEG time-domain features in the frequency range of 0.3-3 Hz, we achieved multiclass-classification accuracies of 38.6 +/- 6.6% (7 classes, 17.1% chance level) for a combination of 6 movements and 1 rest condition. The grand average confusion matrix shows highest true positive rates (TPR) for the rest (63%) condition while TPR for the movement classes varied between 33 to 41%. The underlying movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) show significant differences between unimanual (e.g left hand vs. right hand grasps) as well unimanual vs. bimanual conditions which both can be attributed to lateralization effects. We believe that these findings can be exploited and further used for attempts in providing persons with spinal cord injury a form of natural control for bimanual neuroprostheses.

In fact, skin reacts to different changes around human. For instance, when the surrounding temperature changes, human skin will react differently. It is known that the activity of skin is regulated by human brain. In this research, for the first time we investigate the relation between the activities of human skin and brain by mathematical analysis of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Method: For this purpose, we employ fractal theory and analyze the variations of fractal dimension of GSR and EEG signals when subjects are exposed to different olfactory stimuli in the form of pleasant odors. Results: Based on the obtained results, the complexity of GSR signal changes with the complexity of EEG signal in case of different stimuli, where by increasing the molecular complexity of olfactory stimuli, the complexity of EEG and GSR signals increases. The results of statistical analysis showed the significant effect of stimulation on variations of complexity of GSR signal. In addition, based on effect size analysis, fourth odor with greatest molecular complexity had the greatest effect on variations of complexity of EEG and GSR signals. Conclusion: Therefore, it can be said that human skin reaction changes with the variations in the activity of human brain. The result of analysis in this research can be further used to make a model between the activities of human skin and brain that will enable us to predict skin reaction to different stimuli.

Methods: The considered strategy is an extension of the Common Spectral Spatial Patterns (CSSP) method, which consists of accommodating available additional information about intra- and inter-electrode correlation into the information matrix employed by the conventional Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) method. Results: Simulation with electmencephalographic signals obtained from two public motor-imagery datasets, in a context of differentiation between binary (left and right-hand) movements, result in an overall classification improvement of 5%, and up to 31.7% for a single individual, when compared to the use of the conventional correlation matrix in CSP-based methods. These results are supported through statistical inference and the analysis of the Receiving Operating Characteristic curve. Conclusion: The results obtained indicate that intra and inter-electrode correlation have relevant information, which have been underestimated by the literature in motor-imagery based BCI applications. Significance: The analyzed time-delay data-augmentation method improves the motor-imagery BCI classification accuracy with a foreseeable increase in the computation complexity.

The research focuses on analysis of ECG and EEG signals applying a deep learning technique to study early prediction of epileptic seizure. Signal processing methods like Empirical Mode Decomposition, spectral analysis, and statistical methods were used. The algorithms were implemented in MATLAB, and the EEG and ECG data were collected from Physiobank and EPILEPSIAE databases. In the window-based analysis of low-frequency spectral area of EEG signals, 78.5% of the cases displayed a significant change as the windows progressed and the onset of seizure was approached. The spectral area of IMF components indicated a possible seizure prediction in 68.9% of the analyzed cases. Considering signals from individual EEG electrodes, the least percentage of seizure prediction was indicated by signals from T4 and F4 electrodes (52.3% and 40.7%, respectively, for spectral peaks and 23.8% and 29.6%, respectively, for spectral area). The results of regression analysis show that prediction of seizures can be possible around 20-30 minutes prior to the actual occurrence of seizures.

Hyperdimensional Computing for Blind and One-Shot Classification of EEG Error-Related Potentials	MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Error-related potentials (ERP); Classification; Hyperdimensional computing		The mathematical properties of high-dimensional (HD) spaces show remarkable agreement with behaviors controlled by the brain. Computing with HD vectors, referred to as "hypervectors," is a brain-inspired alternative to computing with numbers. HD computing is characterized by generality, scalability, robustness, and fast learning, making it a prime candidate for utilization in application domains such as brain-computer interfaces. We describe the use of HD computing to classify electroencephalography (EEG) error-related potentials for noninvasive brain-computer interfaces. Our algorithmnaturallyencodes neural activity recorded from 64 EEG electrodes to a single temporal-spatial hypervector without requiring any electrode selection process. This hypervector represents the event of interest, can be analyzed to identify the most discriminative electrodes, and is used for recognition of the subject's intentions. Using the full set of training trials, HD computing achieves on average 5% higher single-trial classification accuracy compared to a conventional machine learning method on this task (74.5% vs. 69.5%) and offers further advantages: (1) Our algorithm learns fast: using only 34% of training trials it achieves an average accuracy of 70.5%, surpassing the conventional method. (2) Conventional method requires priordomain expertknowledge, or a separate process, to carefully select a subset of electrodes for a subsequent preprocessor and classifier, whereas our algorithm blindly uses all 64 electrodes, tolerates noises in data, and the resulting hypervector is intrinsically clustered into HD space; in addition, most preprocessing of the electrode signal can be eliminated while maintaining an average accuracy of 71.7%.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel, neuro-physiologically inspired convolutional neural network (CNN) named Filter-Bank Convolutional Network (FBCNet) for MI classification. Capturing neurophysiological signatures of MI, FBCNet first creates a multi-view representation of the data by bandpass-filtering the EEG into multiple frequency bands. Next, spatially discriminative patterns for each view are learned using a CNN layer. Finally, the temporal information is aggregated using a new variance layer and a fully connected layer classifies the resultant features into MI classes. We evaluate the performance of FBCNet on a publicly available dataset from Korea University for classification of left vs right hand MI in a subject-specific 10-fold cross-validation setting. Results show that FBCNet achieves more than 6.7% higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning architectures while requiring less than 1% of the learning parameters. We explain the higher classification accuracy achieved by FBCNet using feature visualization where we show the superiority of FBCNet in learning interpretable and highly generalizable discriminative features. We provide the source code of FBCNet for reproducibility of results.	[Mane, Ravikiran; Robinson, Neethu; Guan, Cuntai] Nanyang Technol Univ, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore, Singapore; [Vinod, A.

The proposed method is realized by EEG signals classification using time-dependent regularized common spatial patterns and deep residual networks. Unlike other existing methods, the proposed method relies on both the spectral and temporal features by preserving the temporal resolution of the spatially-filtered EEG signals. These features are projected onto an image representation and fed into a residual network for a hierarchical feature learning and classification.

Although deep learning has a good effect on feature extraction, the current deep learning methods usually need to set a large number of parameters manually, which is time consuming. Hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) needs only less manual intervention and can extract features by a multi-layer feature representation framework, which is much faster than the traditional deep learning methods. A CADx framework based on H-ELM, named DCADx, is proposed. As common spatial pattern (CSP) and brain functional network (BFN) have been proven to have better de-redundancy effects on brain data, the DCADx contains two different data redundancy reduction methods: (1) CSP-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-CSP model) and (2) BFN-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-BFN model). The experimental evaluation proved the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The DCADx-CSP model obtained 83.2% on Alzheimer's disease and 82.5% on Parkinson's disease. The DCADx-BFN obtained 89.3% on Alzheimer's disease and 88.7% on Parkinson's disease. DCADx can make full use of the feature expression ability of H-ELM to achieve better performance. CSP and BFN can reduce the redundancy to enhance the diagnostic accuracy further.

MW can have both good as well as detrimental effects. Hence, it is crucial to measure MW. This interesting phenomenon and part of our daily life can be effectively measured using EEG signals. Several techniques that have been used to predict MW. However, literature shows that there are still chances of further improvement in this field. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a framework based on data mining and machine learning to detect MW using EEG signals. In our framework, we extracted a number of features EEG channels. The performance of our proposed framework has been evaluated using 19 sessions of two subjects. The accuracy of the proposed framework is higher than the other researches under this field that indicates the superiority of our proposed framework.

Inspired by emerging deep generative models, we propose three methods for augmenting EEG training data to enhance the performance of emotion recognition models.Approach.Our proposed methods are based on two deep generative models, variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN), and two data augmentation ways, full and partial usage strategies. For the full usage strategy, all of the generated data are augmented to the training dataset without judging the quality of the generated data, while for the partial usage, only high-quality data are selected and appended to the training dataset. These three methods are called conditional Wasserstein GAN (cWGAN), selective VAE (sVAE), and selective WGAN (sWGAN).Main results.To evaluate the effectiveness of these proposed methods, we perform a systematic experimental study on two public EEG datasets for emotion recognition, namely, SEED and DEAP. We first generate realistic-like EEG training data in two forms: power spectral density and differential entropy. Then, we augment the original training datasets with a different number of generated realistic-like EEG data. Finally, we train support vector machines and deep neural networks with shortcut layers to build affective models using the original and augmented training datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed data augmentation methods based on generative models outperform the existing data augmentation approaches such as conditional VAE, Gaussian noise, and rotational data augmentation. We also observe that the number of generated data should be less than 10 times of the original training dataset to achieve the best performance.Significance.The augmented training datasets produced by our proposed sWGAN method significantly enhance the performance of EEG-based emotion recognition models.

Five common frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) were extracted from the signals as linear features, as well as, wavelet packet decomposition to break down signals into certain frequency bands. Afterwards, two entropy measures, namely sample entropy and approximate entropy were applied on the wavelet packet coefficients as nonlinear features, and significant features were selected via genetic algorithm (GA). Three machine-learning algorithms were used for classification; including support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP) a novel enhanced K-nearest neighbors (E-KNN), which uses GA to optimize the feature-space distances and provides a feature importance index. The highest accuracy obtained by using frequency-based features was from gamma oscillations which resulted in 91.38%. Performance of nonlinear features were better compared to the frequency-based features and the results showed 94.28% accuracy. The combination of the features showed 98.44% accuracy with the new proposed E-KNN classifier.

There is need for an EEG noise/outlier resistant algorithm with a good classification accuracy. In this paper, we present a new technique for EEG signal classification to study whether a person remembers faces he or she has seen or not. For this purpose, our method applies denoising using discrete wavelet transform, time-locked EEG activity before generating templates for each class that indicates whether a person remembered or forgot. This novel technique was compared with well-known classification algorithms such as Discriminant Analysis (DA), Support Vector machines (SVM using linear kernel) and Decision Trees (DT). Our Template Matching for EEG Single trial (ETMEST) technique outperformed them all. For all subjects, the average classification accuracy of ETMEST was 94%. Also, we applied this technique on a visually evoked potential EEG dataset based on c-VEP BCI speller system to detect symbol/alphabet recognition events. The results show this method can be reliably applied to EEG-based Communication, Brain Computer Interface(BCI) applications and other signal classification problems. It is additionally surmised from this investigation that during memory encoding, the signals from the frontal and temporal lobes are the strongest and during decoding, signals from the frontal and parietal lobes are the strongest.

In fNIRS, near-infrared light is injected into the scalp and the intensity of the reflected light is registered in optodes. Light absorption in hemoglobin depends on the level of blood oxygenation, which is related to brain activity. In this technique, two parameters are measured at each optode, the relative level of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and the relative level of deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR). In this work we investigated the feasibility of predicting epileptic seizures, using either fNIRS, EEG, or a combination of both signals. In one set of experiments, different implementations for epileptic seizure prediction are tested by using (1) different combinations of electrical and optical signals (EEG, HbO, HbR, EEG+HbO, EEG+HbR, HbO+HbR, EEG+HbO+HbR) and (2) two different classifiers, (Support Vector Machine - SVM and Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP). In the second set of experiments, seizures are predicted within a five-minute window that is moved up to 15 minutes before the start of the epileptic seizure. By computing the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the accuracy, it is demonstrated that fNIRS -based epileptic prediction outperforms EEG-based epileptic prediction. By using optical signals and the SVM classifier, a PPV greater than 99% and an accuracy of 100% were obtained. PPV values of 100% are also obtained when seizures are predicted up to 15 minutes in advance. Furthermore, Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) is used to demonstrate that the highest separability among the classes, corresponding to different epileptic signal phases (pre-ictal, ictal, and inter-ictal), is achieved when fNIRS recordings are used as features for prediction. Finally, fNIRS-based epileptic seizure prediction is tested with Random Chance classifiers. In this study, we showed that fNIRS signals are an effective tool to predict epileptic seizures, even without the use of EEG signals, which are the current standard for seizure prediction.

Decoding Neural Responses to Motion-in-Depth Using EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motion-in-depth; stereomotion; EEG; IOVD; CD; multivariate decoding; motion perception	MULTIVARIATE PATTERN-ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; BINOCULAR MECHANISMS; SPEED DISCRIMINATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; 3D MOTION; AREA MT; DISPARITY; VELOCITY; NEURONS	Two stereoscopic cues that underlie the perception of motion-in-depth (MID) are changes in retinal disparity over time (CD) and interocular velocity differences (IOVD). These cues have independent spatiotemporal sensitivity profiles, depend upon different low-level stimulus properties, and are potentially processed along separate cortical pathways. Here, we ask whether these MID cues code for different motion directions: do they give rise to discriminable patterns of neural signals, and is there evidence for their convergence onto a single "motion-in-depth" pathway? To answer this, we use a decoding algorithm to test whether, and when, patterns of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals measured from across the full scalp, generated in response to CD- and IOVD-isolating stimuli moving toward or away in depth can be distinguished. We find that both MID cue type and 3D-motion direction can be decoded at different points in the EEG timecourse and that direction decoding cannot be accounted for by static disparity information. Remarkably, we find evidence for late processing convergence: IOVD motion direction can be decoded relatively late in the timecourse based on a decoder trained on CD stimuli, and vice versa. We conclude that early CD and IOVD direction decoding performance is dependent upon fundamentally different low-level stimulus features, but that later stages of decoding performance may be driven by a central, shared pathway that is agnostic to these features. Overall, these data are the first to show that neural responses to CD and IOVD cues that move toward and away in depth can be decoded from EEG signals, and that different aspects of MID-cues contribute to decoding performance at different points along the EEG timecourse.

By using temporally local samples to construct the covariance matrices, the approach of local temporal common spatial patterns (LTCSP) are developed, which performs manifold modeling. It is useful to consider the intrinsic structure of samples in defining the temporally local covariance matrices. From the perspective of neurophysiological knowledge, phase synchronization indicates information communication. In this paper, we apply phase locking value (PLV) to quantify the phase relationship between samples, which are then adopted as weights to define the temporally local covariance matrices. As a result, we obtain the PLV-modulated LTCSP. More discriminative features are discovered with the approach proposed. Experiments of EEG classification on three EEG data sets (i.e., the data sets Ma and IVa of BCI competition III and the data set Ila of BCI competition IV) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The average classification accuracies of the proposed method on the three data sets are 90.56%, 83.25%, and 83.26%. In the case of noise introduced, the average classification accuracy of the proposed method exceeds the conventional CSP and LTCSP by nearly 10% and 6%, respectively. The hypothesis test indicates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of statistical significance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Speech segmentation based on the relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity can be used to estimate segmental contributions to perception in noisy conditions. High-RMS-level segments contain crucial information for speech perception. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of high-RMS-level speech segments on auditory attention decoding performance under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Scalp EEG signals were recorded when subjects listened to the attended speech stream in the mixed speech narrated concurrently by two Mandarin speakers. The temporal response function was used to identify the attended speech from EEG responses of tracking to the temporal envelopes of intact speech and high-RMS-level speech segments alone, respectively. Auditory decoding performance was then analyzed under various SNR conditions by comparing EEG correlations to the attended and ignored speech streams. The accuracy of auditory attention decoding based on the temporal envelope with high-RMS-level speech segments was not inferior to that based on the temporal envelope of intact speech. Cortical activity correlated more strongly with attended than with ignored speech under different SNR conditions. These results suggest that EEG recordings corresponding to high-RMS-level speech segments carry crucial information for the identification and tracking of attended speech in the presence of background noise. This study also showed that with the modulation of auditory attention, attended speech can be decoded more robustly from neural activity than from behavioral measures under a wide range of SNR.

Traditional techniques to evaluate worker stress (e.g., self-assessment and observational checklists) may not be effective in the field because of their potential to interrupt workers' ongoing tasks. Additionally, these methods are subject to biases. Research in neuroscience confirms that the human brain responds to various stressors, so studying patterns of brainwave activity can lead to strong assessments of subjects' stress. The authors' earlier research has monitored worker stress using a wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headset by applying supervised learning algorithms in a binary stress level (i.e., low and high). Despite the success of earlier work identifying excessive stress, there is a gap in knowledge in assessing medium-level stresses. It has been proven that intermittent exposure to medium-level stress decreases not only performance but also concentration and focus. This research attempts to identify multiple levels of worker stress using signals recorded from a wearable EEG headset by applying two supervised learning algorithms, multi-class support vector machines (SVM) and fully connected neural network (FCNN). A stress-related hormone, cortisol, was used as a baseline to label subjects' stress levels. In classifying three levels of stress, the FCNN yielded a prediction accuracy of 79.26%, which is competitive with previous EEG-based stress recognition methods in a binary setting. This research should help in identifying multiple levels of stress at construction sites and aid early detection and mitigation of high stress in the field.

This study proposes an inter-subject CW classifier, extreme learning machine (ELM)-based deep stacked denoising autoencoder ensemble (ED-SDAE), to adapt the variations of the electroencephalogram (EEG) feature distributions across different subjects. The ED-SDAE consists of two cascade-connected modules, which are termed as high level personalized feature abstractions and abstraction fusion. The combination of SDAE and locality preserving projection (LPP) technique is regarded as base learner to obtain ensemble members for training meta-classifier by stacking-based approach. The ELM model with Q-statistics diversity measurement is acted as meta-classifier to fuse above inputs to improve classification performance. The feasibility of the SD-SDAE is tested by two EEG databases. The multi-class classification rate achieves 0.6353 and 0.6747 for TI and T2 respectively, and significantly outperforms several shallow and deep CW estimators. By computing the main time complexity, the computational workload of the ED-SDAE is also acceptable for high-dimensional EEG features.

'they are useful in the diagnosis of hyperkinetic movement disorders, particularly tremors and myoclonus. The most commonly used measures are surface electromyography (sEMG), electroencephalography (EEG) and accelerometry. Frequency and coherence analyses of sEMG signals may reveal the nature of tremors and the source of the tremors. The effects of voluntary tapping, ballistic movements and weighting of the limbs can help to distinguish between organic and functional tremors. The presence of Bereitschaftspotentials and beta-band desynchronization recorded by EEG before movement onset provide strong evidence for functional movement disorders. EMG burst durations, distributions and muscle recruitment orders may identify and classify myoclonus to cortical, subcortical or spinal origins and help in the diagnosis of functional myoclonus. Organic and functional cervical dystonia can potentially be distinguished by EMG power spectral analysis. Several reflex circuits, such as the long latency reflex, blink reflex and startle reflex, can be elicited with different types of external stimuli and are useful in the assessment of myoclonus, excessive startle and stiff person syndrome. However, limitations of the tests should be recognized, and the results should be interpreted together with clinical observations.

Nonlinear vector decomposed neural network based EEG signal feature extraction and detection of seizure	MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS			English	Article						Elliptic seizure; Wavelet transform; Frequency domain; Nonlinear Vector Decomposition	DIAGNOSIS	Electroencephalography is one of the important medical methods to evaluate and treat neurophysiology to combat disease related to seizure. The automatic seizure detection system aims to provide a balanced mechanism by excavating deep knowledge of the basic signal and kinetic domains. Contingent alert is given to initiate treatment to reduce the risk of injury in patients with epilepsy and to overcome contingencies. Moreover, the multi-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) data of seizure detection in conventional machine learning algorithms cannot effectively accommodate both global and spatial information. Therefore in this work proposed a Nonlinear Vector Decomposed Neural Network (NVDN) to detect the seizure from EEG signal. The proposed NVDN based seizure detection system consist of three major stages they are as follows i) EEG preprocessing ii) Feature Extraction and iii) NVDN Classification. In this work, the NVDN technique is applied to improve the accuracy of seizure detection after using frequency domain feature to obtain the results from EEG waves. The performance of the proposed system is validate through MATLAB simulation. The results of the simulation show that the proposed NVDN method is able to effectively detect the seizure with a sensitivity of 94.7%. Specificity of 94.1% and accuracy 95.60%. As compared with conventional methods the proposed system achieve high detecting ratio. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study adopts an automatic machine learning method to construct a dual-CNN (convolutional neural network) of high performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The model can optimize its hyperparameters continuously on its own initiative. Experimental results in the evaluation of depression using real EEG datasets indicate that (1) the proposed method executes 3.5 times faster compared with a conventional counterpart; (2) the dual-CNN gains a significant performance improvement (versus CapsuleNet and Resnet-16) in identifying Major Depression Disorder (MDD) with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity up to 98.81, 98.36, and 99.31 percent respectively; and those for treatment outcome are 99.52, 99.63, and 99.37 percent respectively, and (3) classification can be completed several hundred times faster than EEG being collected upon a COTS computer.

This study explores the use of unsupervised machine learning in discovering themes in medical records of patients presenting with PNES. We hypothesised that themes generated by machine learning are comparable with the classification by human experts. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of the medical records in the emergency department of patients (age >18 years) with PNES who underwent inpatient video-electroencephalography monitoring from May 2009 to June 2014 and received a final diagnosis of PNES. Prior to machine learning of written text, we applied a standardised approach in natural language processing to create a document-term matrix (removal of numbers, stop-words and punctuations, transforming fonts to lower case). The words were separated into tokens and treated as if existing within a bag-of-words. A probability of each word existing within a topic (theme) was modelled on multivariate Dirichlet distribution (R Foundation, V.3.5.0). Next, we asked four experts to independently provide a clinical interpretation of the generated topics. When the majority of (>= 3) experts agreed, it was regarded as highly congruent. Interactive data are available on the web at (https://gntem2.github.io/PNES/#topic=1&lambda=0.6& term=). Results There were 39 patients (74.4% women, median age 35 years with range 20-82). A total of 121 documents were converted to text files for text mining. There were 15 generated topics with 12/15 topics rated as highly congruent. The main themes were about descriptors of seizures and medication use. Conclusions The findings from machine learning on PNES-related documentation provides evidence for the feasibility of applying machine-learning methodology to analyse large volumes of medical records. The topics generated by machine learning were congruent with interpretations by clinicians indicating this method can be used for screening of medical conditions among large volumes of medical records.

In these conditions, powerful machine learning techniques are essential to deal with the large amount of information and overcome the curse of dimensionality. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have achieved promising performance in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, but they involve computationally intensive training algorithms and hyperparameter optimization methods. Thus, an awareness of the quality-cost trade-off, although usually overlooked, is highly beneficial. In this paper, we apply a hyperparameter optimization procedure based on Genetic Algorithms to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), all of them purposely shallow. We compare their relative quality and energy-time cost, but we also analyze the variability in the structural complexity of networks of the same type with similar accuracies. The experimental results show that the optimization procedure improves accuracy in all models, and that CNN models with only one hidden convolutional layer can equal or slightly outperform a 6-layer Deep Belief Network. FFNN and RNN were not able to reach the same quality, although the cost was significantly lower. The results also highlight the fact that size within the same type of network is not necessarily correlated with accuracy, as smaller models can and do match, or even surpass, bigger ones in performance. In this regard, overfitting is likely a contributing factor since deep learning approaches struggle with limited training examples.

Despite the success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in other fields, only recently these techniques have been applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. One drawback of CNNs is the lack of interpretation of the learned features. In this study we introduce for the first time a sinc-convolutional layer into a CNN for EEG motor execution decoding, allowing a straightforward interpretation of the learned kernels. Furthermore, we apply a gradient-based analysis to assess the most relevant EEG bands for each movement and the most relevant EEG electrodes exploited in these bands. In addition to a slight accuracy improvement from 91.9 to 92.4%, our results suggest that the high. band is the most relevant EEG band, with gradient-based scalp distributions well localized at specific subsets of electrodes.

In the last few years, a huge number of learners around the world have registered in massive open online courses (MOOCs) provided by various online learning platforms. However, MOOC platforms have a vital task for the online course provider to provide enhanced students' learning experiences and satisfaction. In this work, we developed a brain-computer interface for gathering data and detecting a learner's mental situation by observing MOOC videos and electroencephalogram (EEG) devices based on John Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory. The acquired EEG signals are preprocessed with two different normalization methods to scale signals. To validate the introduced framework, the system adopted three machine learning algorithms (random forest using non-Markovian model, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors) to develop a model with preprocessed training data and test the classifiers to validate their ensemble classifiers' performance. Finally, experimental analysis showed that the random forest classifier with the non-Markovian approach achieved more than the other two techniques in the form of overall accuracy (99.15%) and F-measures (99.21%).

An optimized deep learning network model for EEG based seizure classification using synchronization and functional connectivity measures	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article						Multicast security; Multiple logical key trees; Group key management; One-way key derivation; Rekeying process; False prediction rate; Convolutional neural networks	PREDICTION; INDEX	Epilepsy is a brain disorder related to alteration in the nervous system which affects around 65 million people among the world's population. Few works are focused on prediction of seizure relied on deep learning approaches, but the capability of optimal design has no longer been absolutely exploited. This work is focused on the seizure prediction obtained from long-short time records using optimized deep learning network model (ODLN). In this paper, the synchronization patterns and its feasibility of distinguishing the pre-ictal from inter-ictal states are examined by utilizing the interaction graph model as a functional connectivity measure. An optimized deep learning network with short- long-term memory is computed for the prediction of epileptic seizures occurrences. For, the modelling of ODLN, pre-analysis is performed with three modules and memory layers. It is finalized from these results; a two-layer ODLN is optimum to perform the epileptic seizure prediction for four different window sizes from 15 to 120 min. The assessment is implemented on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG data set, providing 100% sensitivity and low false prediction rate ranges from 0.10 to 0.02 for seizure prediction. The proposed ODLN methodology reveals a notable increase in the performance rate of seizure prediction when compared with existing machine learning and Convolutional neural networks methods.

One of these abnormalities is the epileptic seizure. A framework is proposed for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG signals recorded from normal and epileptic patients. The suggested approach is designed to classify the abnormal signal from the normal one automatically. This work aims to improve the accuracy of epileptic seizure detection and reduce computational costs. To address this, the proposed framework uses the 54-DWT mother wavelets analysis of EEG signals using the Genetic algorithm (GA) in combination with other four machine learning (ML) classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Naive Bayes (NB). The performance of 14 different combinations of two-class epilepsy detection is investigated using these four ML classifiers. The experimental results show that the four classifiers produce comparable results for the derived statistical features from the 54-DWT mother wavelets; however, the ANN classifier achieved the best accuracy in most datasets combinations, and it outperformed the other examined classifiers.

The recent success of deep learning-based algorithms in classifying different brain signals warrants further exploration to determine whether it is feasible for the inter-subject continuous decoding of MI signals to provide contingent neurofeedback which is important for neurorehabilitative BCI designs. In this paper, we have shown how a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning framework can be used for inter-subject continuous decoding of MI related electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using the novel concept of Mega Blocks for adapting the network against inter-subject variabilities. These Mega Blocks have the capacity to repeat a specific architectural block several times such as one or more convolutional layers in a single Mega Block. The parameters of such Mega Blocks can be optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. The results, obtained on the publicly available BCI competition IV-2b dataset, yields an average inter-subject continuous decoding accuracy of 71.49% (kappa = 0.42) and 70.84% (kappa = 0.42) for two different training methods such as adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and stochastic gradient descent (SGDM), respectively, in 7 out of 9 subjects. Our results show for the first time that it is feasible to use CNN based architectures for inter-subject continuous decoding with a sufficient level of accuracy for developing calibration-free MI-BCIs for practical purposes.

To overcome such disadvantages, numerous seizure detection techniques involving signal processing and machine learning tools have been developed. However, there still remain the problems of automatic detection with high efficiency and accuracy in distinguishing normal, interictal and ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this study we propose a novel method for automatic identification of epileptic seizures in singe-channel EEG signals based upon time-scale decomposition (ITD), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks. First, EEG signals are decomposed into a series of proper rotation components (PRCs) and a baseline signal by using the ITD method. The first two PRCs of the EEG signals are extracted, which contain most of the EEG signals' energy and are considered to be the predominant PRCs. Second, four levels DWT is employed to decompose the predominant PRCs into different frequency bands, in which third-order Daubechies (db3) wavelet function is selected for analysis. Third, phase space of the PRCs is reconstructed based on db3, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear EEG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in EEG system dynamics between normal, interictal and ictal EEG signals. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify EEG system dynamics between normal (healthy), interictal and ictal EEG signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on the University of Bonn's widely used and publicly available epilepsy dataset to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy for eleven cases is reported to be 98.15%. Compared with many state-of-the-art methods, the results demonstrate superior performance and the proposed method can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic detection of seizure EEG signals in the clinical application.

Complex RNNs could be hardly deployed on wearable devices due to their computation and memory-intensive processing patterns. Generally, reduction in precision leads much more efficiency and binarized RNNs are introduced as energy-efficient solutions. However, naive binarization methods lead to significant accuracy loss in EEG classification. In this paper, we propose a multi-level binarized LSTM, which significantly reduces computations whereas ensuring an accuracy pretty close to the full precision LSTM. Our method reduces the delay of the 3-bit LSTM cell operation 47x with less than 0.01% accuracy loss.

However, how to make full use of different EEG features and the discriminative local patterns among the features for different emotions is challenging. Existing models ignore the complementarity among the spatial-spectral-temporal features and discriminative local patterns in all features, which limits the classification ability of the models to a certain extent. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-spectral-temporal based attention 3D dense network, named SST-EmotionNet, for EEG emotion recognition. The main advantage of the SST-EmotionNet is the simultaneous integration of spatial-spectral-temporal features in a unified network framework. Meanwhile, a 3D attention mechanism is designed to adaptively explore discriminative local patterns. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the SST-EmotionNet outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

Detection of epileptic attack is commonly carried out by viewing and analysing long-duration multi-channel EEG records. To counter this time-consuming process, a hybrid Local Binary Pattern-Wavelet based approach, classifying EEG in epileptic patients, is adopted in this research. Epilepsy is characterized by multiple ictal patterns in the form of synchronous epileptiform discharge transients. This work attempts to classify seizure from normal EEG recordings using the low-frequency activity. In order to perform this classification, the EEG signal is filtered and then transformed using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) into a new signal. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is employed to decompose the obtained signal. Wavelet coefficients are calculated to 5 levels of decomposition. A combination of univariate and bivariate features forms the feature set for seizure detection. This feature set extracted from low-frequency band coefficients helps in bringing out the dispersion, symmetry, and peakedness present in the EEG signal. A novel LBP based Spatio-temporal analysis of the continuous EEG signal for epilepsy detection is carried out on 105 seizures from 14 randomly selected subjects of CHB-MIT EEG database. A sensitivity of 100% is achieved on the CHB-MIT database while long term EEG is being tested with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. The algorithm works well to obtain a false detection rate (FP/Hour) of 0.59. The specificity of 99.8% is attained with a mean accuracy of 99.6% when tested on 498.9 h of EEG data.

The manual examination of these signals by experts is strenuous and time consuming. Hence, machine learning techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of detection. Nowadays, deep learning methodologies have been used in medical field to diagnose the health conditions precisely and aid the clinicians. In this study, a new deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) model is proposed for the automatic recognition of normal and abnormal EEG signals. The proposed model is a complete end-to-end structure which classifies the EEG signals without requiring any feature extraction. In this study, we have used the EEG signals from temporal to occipital (T5-O1) single channel obtained from Temple University Hospital EEG Abnormal Corpus (v2.0.0) EEG dataset to develop the 1D CNN model. Our developed model has yielded the classification error rate of 20.66% in classifying the normal and abnormal EEG signals.

In the method, the statistic characteristics of ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) are obtained by analyzing in each time point of synchronous BCI, and then the probability model is established to compute the Chernoff error bound, which is adopted as the weight of common classifier to take the discriminant process. The test experiments are based on the datasets from BCI competitions, and the proposed frame method is employed to compose with LDA, SVM, ELM respectively.

Although a lot of research works have been proposed to improve CSP, most of these works have the problems of large computation costs and long feature extraction time. To this end, three new feature extraction methods based on CSP and a new feature selection method based on non-convex log regularization are proposed in this paper. Firstly, EEG signals are spatially filtered by CSP, and then three new feature extraction methods are proposed. We called them CSP-wavelet, CSP-WPD and CSP-FB, respectively. For CSP-Wavelet and CSP-WPD, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) or wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is used to decompose the spatially filtered signals, and then the energy and standard deviation of the wavelet coefficients are extracted as features. For CSP-FB, the spatially filtered signals are filtered into multiple bands by a filter bank (FB), and then the logarithm of variances of each band are extracted as features. Secondly, a sparse optimization method regularized with a non-convex log function is proposed for the feature selection, which we called LOG, and an optimization algorithm for LOG is given. Finally, ensemble learning is used for secondary feature selection and classification model construction. Combing feature extraction and feature selection methods, a total of three new EEG decoding methods are obtained, namely CSP-Wavelet+LOG, CSP-WPD+LOG, and CSP-FB+LOG. Four public motor imagery datasets are used to verify the performance of the proposed methods. Compared to existing methods, the proposed methods achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 88.86, 83.40, 81.53, and 80.83 in datasets 1-4, respectively. The feature extraction time of CSP-FB is the shortest. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively improve the classification accuracy and reduce the feature extraction time. With comprehensive consideration of classification accuracy and feature extraction time, CSP-FB+LOG has the best performance and can be used for the real-time BCI system.

In the literature, this issue was addressed differently most of the time using handcrafted temporal and spectral features, machine learning techniques and rarely deep learning with extracted features. In this paper, we introduce an LSTM model designed to address the chaotic nature of an EEG signal in order to predict pre-ictal and inter-ictal states.

The nonparametric rules of decision reveal vital EEG patterns that distinguish between several tasks. The general truth of findings is measured by the cross-validation recognition rate. This method is employed to derive signals from a group of adults performing several complex works. These cognitive signals that distinguish between assignments are keeping with visual EEG understandings and spectral intensity analysis and enhance the results. Since tasks recognized, it is clear that EEG signals can distinguish that complex behavior or sensory-motivating and performance-related factors that are related to the cognitive components of the work. The obtained results achieve high accuracy and sensitivity rate with less error rate.

Electroencephalograph (EEG) is an effective method of detection. Therefore, it has great significance to research the relationship between stereoscopic acuity and EEG signals for the development of 3D technology. New method: This paper proposes a multi-channel selection sparse time window common spatial group (MCS-STWCSG) multi-classification method. Firstly, a channel selection method based on improved common spatial pattern- (CSP-) rank is applied to select optimal channels to reduce redundant signal. Secondly, based on the one vs. one (OVO) computational model, we extend traditional CSP to the common spatial group (CSG) to implement three-classification. Finally, this paper optimizes time-frequency characteristics and hybrid signal features by sparse regression and utilizes a support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel to identify depth dynamic random dot stereogram (DRDS) video tasks. Results: The selected channels are all located in and near the occipital region and time-frequency characteristics can acquire better classification results compared with frequency characteristics. The highest classification result can reach 94.67%. Comparison with existing methods: The MCS-STWCSG multi-classification method optimizes features from multiple aspects and its performance is obviously better than other methods for hybrid EEG signals of depth DRDS. Conclusions: Channel selection and time-frequency segmentation for feature extraction and classification algorithm of EEG signals can increase the classification accuracy. It proves the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method.

This paper presents a machine learning approach using information theoretic features extracted from high-frequency subbands to detect the epileptic focus from interictal intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). It is known that high-frequency subbands (>80Hz) include important biomarkers such as high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) for identifying epileptic focus commonly referred to as the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this analysis, the multi-channel interictal iEEG signals were splitted into segments and each segment was decomposed into multiple high-frequency subbands. The different types of entropy were calculated for each of the subbands and the sparse linear discriminant analysis (sLDA) was applied to select the prominent entropy features. Due to the imbalance of SOZ and non-SOZ channels in iEEG data, the use of machine learning techniques is always tricky. To deal with the imbalanced learning problem, an adaptive synthetic oversampling approach (ADASYN) with radial basis function kernel-based SVM was used to detect the focal segments. Finally, the epileptic focus was identified based on detection of focal segments on SOZ and non-SOZ channels. Eight patients were examined to observe the efficiency of the automatic detector. The experimental results and statistical tests indicate that the proposed automatic detector can identify the epileptic focus accurately and efficiently.

J	Ieracitano, C; Mammone, N; Hussain, A; Morabito, FC				Ieracitano, Cosimo; Mammone, Nadia; Hussain, Amir; Morabito, Francesco C.			A novel multi-modal machine learning based approach for automatic classification of EEG recordings in dementia	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Machine learning; Continuous wavelet transform; Bispectrum; Alzheimer's disease; Mild cognitive impairment; Data fusion	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; DYNAMICS	Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings generate an electrical map of the human brain that are useful for clinical inspection of patients and in biomedical smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) and BrainComputer Interface (BCI) applications. From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a nonlinear and nonstationary, multivariate representation of the underlying neural circuitry interactions. In this paper, a novel multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed to integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the aim is to discriminate Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically, in order to effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG signals are projected into the time-frequency (TF) domain by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and a set of appropriate features (denoted as CWT features) are extracted from delta, theta, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS) are extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a second set of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also evaluated in the five EEG sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed into a number of ML classifiers to perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. HC) classifications. As an experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that includes 63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when the concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multimodal (CWT+BiS) features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Consequently, our proposed multi-modal ML scheme can be considered a viable alternative to state-of-the-art computationally intensive deep learning approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Particularly, gait-event-related brain potentials (gERPs) may provide information about the functional role of cortical brain regions in human gait control. The purpose of this paper is to explore possible experimental and technical solutions for time-sensitive analysis of human gait ERPs during spontaneous and instructed treadmill walking. A solution (hardware/software) for synchronous recording of gait and EEG data was developed, tested and piloted. The solution consists of a custom-made USB synchronization interface, a time-synchronization module, and a data-merging module, allowing the temporal synchronization of recording devices, time-sensitive extraction of gait markers for the analysis of gERPs, and the training of artificial neural networks. In the present manuscript, the hardware and software components were tested with the following devices: A treadmill with an integrated pressure plate for gait analysis (zebris FDM-T) and an Acticap non-wireless 32-channel EEG system (Brain Products GmbH). The usability and validity of the developed solution was investigated in a pilot study (n= 3 healthy participants,n= 3 females, mean age = 22.75 years). The recorded continuous EEG data were segmented into epochs according to the detected gait markers for the analysis of gERPs. Finally, the EEG epochs were used to train a deep learning artificial neural network as classifier of gait phases. The results obtained in this pilot study, although preliminary, support the feasibility of the solution for the application of gait-related EEG analysis.

An Exploratory Study Using Electroencephalography (EEG) to Measure the Smartphone User Experience in the Short Term	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FLOW EXPERIENCE; TOP-DOWN; OSCILLATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; NEUROSCIENCE; ATTITUDES; EMOTIONS; GENDER; MEMORY	UX (User experience) can influence important user behaviors, including user preference, purchasing decisions, and customer loyalty. The ability to assess UX during the product trial has practical significance for design and improvement of products. In this article, two smartphones with different UX were selected through a focus group. In the EEG (electroencephalography) experiment, we explored the brain signal of users when using two smartphones to complete three tasks. The brain signal of each participant was recorded through Curry Neuroimaging Suite software (Version 7.0, Compumedics Limited, Abbotsford, Australia) when they were using the smartphones. Then results from behavioral, subjective and neural responses were analyzed. The behavioral results showed that participants completed the three tasks faster by using a smartphone with a higher score of UX. The subjective results showed a significant difference between the two smartphones. The patterns of cortical activity were obtained in the five principal frequency bands, Delta (1-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-13 Hz), Beta (13-30 Hz) and Gamma (30-45 Hz). The results indicated that a smartphone with higher scores of UX could evoke stronger relative power of Alpha (fronto-central, parietal and partieto-occipital regions), Delta (frontal region) and Gamma rhythms (C3 site), but weaker relative power of Beta (left central region) and Theta rhythms (frontal and parieto-occipital regions). Also, the correlation analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between EEG and behavioral results. User's subjective experience had a significant positive correlation with the relative power of Gamma band, but a negative correlation with Beta and Theta bands (approximately significant with p = .078 and p = .071). There were also significant correlations between EEG results and sub-items of UX. Our ?ndings suggest that the difference in EEG may be taken as an evaluating indicator of user perception when using products without interruption.

Their alterations are pathologically involved in various psychiatric disorders. Results of earlier studies suggest that imagery behaviors are correlated with the modulated activities of the respective modality-specific regions and the additional activities of supramodal imagery-related regions. Additionally, despite the availability of complexity analysis in the neuroimaging field, it has not been used for neural decoding approaches. Therefore, we sought to characterize neural oscillation related to multimodal imagery through complexity-based neural decoding. For this study, we modified existing complexity measures to characterize the time evolution of temporal complexity. We took magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of eight healthy subjects as they performed multimodal imagery and non-imagery tasks. The MEG data were decomposed into amplitude and phase of sub-band frequencies by Hilbert-Huang transform. Subsequently, we calculated the complexity values of each reconstructed time series, along with raw data and band power for comparison, and applied these results as inputs to decode visual perception (VP), visual imagery (VI), motor execution (ME), and motor imagery (MI) functions. Consequently, intra-subject decoding with the complexity yielded a characteristic sensitivity map for each task with high decoding accuracy. The map is inverted in the occipital regions between VP and VI and in the central regions between ME and MI. Additionally, replacement of the labels into two classes as imagery and non-imagery also yielded better classification performance and characteristic sensitivity with the complexity. It is particularly interesting that some subjects showed characteristic sensitivities not only in modality-specific regions, but also in supramodal regions. These analyses indicate that two-class and four-class classifications each provided better performance when using complexity than when using raw data or band power as input. When inter-subject decoding was used with the same model, characteristic sensitivity maps were also obtained, although their decoding performance was lower. Results of this study underscore the availability of complexity measures in neural decoding approaches and suggest the possibility of a modality-independent imagery-related mechanism. The use of time evolution of temporal complexity in neural decoding might extend our knowledge of the neural bases of hierarchical functions in the human brain.

EEG data in interictal and preictal periods from the CHB-MIT dataset are used for seizure prediction. First, the original signals are decomposed into several frequency bands using a digital wavelet transform (DWT). Then, features including standard deviation (S), log of amplitude (L), quartile (Q) and coefficient of variation (CV) are extracted. Finally, different combinations of feature vectors are fed into classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM)) to classify the above two states (preictal and interictal states). Performance analysis shows that the optimal feature is CV, the optimal sub-band is 16-31 Hz and the optimal EEG channel can be chosen as FP1-F7, T7-P7, FP1-F3, P3-O1 or P7-T7. By comparing the classification results, ELM provides a more robust and higher overall accuracy than SVM, and the best average accuracy of both ELM and SVM can reach as high as 100%.

A more detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and timing of the synchronization of frequency bands would contribute substantially to the clarification of neural mechanisms that underlie performance of the Go/NoGo task. Methods The present study used a machine learning approach to learn the features that distinguish between ERSPs involved in selection and inhibition in a Go/NoGo task. A single-layer neural network classifier was used to predict task conditions for each subject to characterize ERSPs associated with Go versus NoGo trials. Results The final classifier accurately identified individual task conditions at an overall rate of 92%, estimated by fivefold cross-validation. The detailed accounting of EEG time-frequency patterns localized to brain regions (i.e., thalamus, pre-SMA, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex) corroborates and also elaborates upon previous findings from fMRI and EEG studies, and expands the information about EEG power changes in multiple frequency bands (i.e., primarily theta power increase, alpha decreases, and beta increases and decreases) within these regions underlying the selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials. Conclusion This time-frequency-based classifier extends previous spatiotemporal findings and provides information about neural mechanisms underlying selection and inhibition processes engaged in Go and NoGo trials, respectively. This neural network classifier can be used to assess time-frequency patterns from an individual subject and thus may offer insight into therapeutic uses of neuromodulation in neural dysfunction.

Towards error categorisation in BCI: single-trial EEG classification between different errors	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						ErrP; EEG; classification; BCI; human machine interaction; neurophysiology; error detection	FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; ERP COMPONENTS; AWARENESS; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; PE	Objective. Error-related potentials (ErrP) are generated in the brain when humans perceive errors. These ErrP signals can be used to classify actions as erroneous or non-erroneous, using single-trial electroencephalography (EEG). A small number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ErrP detection as feedback for reinforcement-learning-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI), confirming the possibility of developing more autonomous BCI. These systems could be made more efficient with specific information about the type of error that occurred. A few studies differentiated the ErrP of different errors from each other, based on direction or severity. However, errors cannot always be categorised in these ways. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of differentiating very similar error conditions from each other, in the absence of previously explored metrics. Approach. In this study, we used two data sets with 25 and 14 participants to investigate the differences between errors. The two error conditions in each task were similar in terms of severity, direction and visual processing. The only notable differences between them were the varying cognitive processes involved in perceiving the errors, and differing contexts in which the errors occurred. We used a linear classifier with a small feature set to differentiate the errors on a single-trial basis. Main results. For both data sets, we observed neurophysiological distinctions between the ErrPs related to each error type. We found further distinctions between age groups. Furthermore, we achieved statistically significant single-trial classification rates for most participants included in the classification phase, with mean overall accuracy of 65.2% and 65.6% for the two tasks. Significance. As a proof of concept our results showed that it is feasible, using single-trial EEG, to classify these similar error types against each other. This study paves the way for more detailed and efficient learning in BCI, and thus for a more autonomous human-machine interaction.

However, labeled EEG samples are generally scarce and expensive to collect, while unlabeled samples are considered to be abundant in real applications. Although the semi-supervised learning (SSL) allows us to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the classification performance as against supervised algorithms, it has been reported that unlabeled data occasionally undermine the performance of SSL in some cases. To overcome this challenge, we propose a collaborative representation-based semi-supervised extreme learning machine (CR-SSELM) algorithm to evaluate the risk of unlabeled samples by a new safety-control mechanism. Specifically, the ELM model is firstly used to predict unlabeled samples and then the collaborative representation (CR) approach is employed to reconstruct the unlabeled samples according to the obtained prediction results, from which the risk degree of unlabeled sample is defined. A risk-based regularization term is then constructed accordingly and embedded into the objective function of the SS-ELM. Experiments conducted on benchmark and EEG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the ELM and SS-ELM algorithm. Moreover, the proposed CR-SSELM even offers the best performance while SS-ELM yields worse performance compared with its supervised counterpart (ELM).

Performances on this complex data set are still not encountering expectations. The purpose of this work is to determine to what extent the use of larger amount of data can help to improve the performances. Two methods are explored: a standard partitioning on a recent and larger version of the TUSZ, and a leave-one-out approach used to increase the amount of data for the training set. XGBoost, a fast implementation of the gradient boosting classifier, is the ideal algorithm for these tasks. The performances obtained are in the range of what is reported until now in the literature with deep learning models. We give interpretation to our results by identifying the most relevant features and analyzing performances by seizure types. We show that generalized seizures tend to be far better predicted than focal ones. We also notice that some EEG channels and features are more important than others to distinguish seizure from background.

Research has shown that such threats often come from malicious insiders. To identify these insiders, survey- and electrocardiogram-based approaches have been proposed; however, these approaches cannot effectively detect or predict any malicious insiders. Recently, electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been suggested as a potential alternative to detect these potential threats. Threat detection using EEG would be highly reliable as it overcomes the limitations of the previous methods. This study proposes a proof of concept for a system wherein a model trained using a deep learning algorithm is employed to evaluate EEG signals to detect insider threats. The algorithm can classify different mental states based on four category risk matrices. In particular, it analyses brainwave signals using long short-term memory (LSTM) designed to remember the previous mental states of each insider and compare them with the current brain state for associated risk-level classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we performed a comparative analysis using logistic regression (LR)-a predictive analysis technique used to describe the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables-on the same dataset.

Early diagnoses are vital for successful recoveries, but with conventional diagnostic imaging techniques and computer systems, radiologists misdiagnose more than 20% of all ischemic strokes. AI methods have been developed for automated neurological disorder prediction using electroencephalographic (EEG) data, but artificial and recurrent classifiers have still seen mediocre performance. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), however, have demonstrated their capacity in personalized spatio- and spectro-temporal non-stationary time series data modeling and pattern recognition. This study developed a SNN model that can detect cerebral ischaemia from temporal EEG data with an accuracy of 94.45%, far exceeding the performance of traditional stroke models operating on computerized tomography data. The approach outlined also required a significantly low number of training samples, having been trained and evaluated on an EEG corpus with recordings from 46 stroke patients and 46 healthy individuals, in addition to being scalable to other neurodegenerative diseases and mental illnesses. Ultimately, the diagnostic precision of the SNN can be adapted in professional environments to replace or be in conjunction with other computerized medical systems to improve ischemic stroke prognosis and recovery.

The proposed model with optimisation is known as WCA-EMD-WMKRVFLN. The tanh and wavelet kernel functions are contributing together to the effectiveness of the proposed model. The features generated from EMD in terms of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are modulated to find important statistical and entropy based features and these features in a reduced form are employed as inputs to the model to classify epileptic EEG signals. The presented approach is evaluated in terms of percentage correct classification accuracy (ACC), specificity and sensitivity using two datasets and is compared with different classifiers and state-of-the-art techniques. The highest accuracies of 99.69% (five-class) and 100% (three-class) achieved using the Bonn-University dataset and 99.0% ACC (two-class) achieved using the Bern-Barcelona dataset. The achieved results report that the presented approach is a promising approach for EEG signal classification and is superior to several state-of-the-art techniques and is highly comparable to many such techniques.

Advanced network analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms provides information on dynamic brain connectivity and could be used in classification processes. If successfully reached, this goal would add a low-cost, easily accessible, and non-invasive technique with neuropsychological tests. Objective: To investigate the possibility to automatically classify physiological versus pathological aging from cortical sources' connectivity based on a support vector machine (SVM) applied to EEG small-world parameter. Methods: A total of 295 subjects were recruited: 120 healthy volunteers and 175 AD. Graph theory functions were applied to undirected and weighted networks obtained by lagged linear coherence evaluated by eLORETA. A machine-learning classifier (SVM) was applied. EEG frequency bands were: delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta1 (13-20 Hz), beta2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz). Results: The receiver operating characteristic curve showed AUC of 0.97 +/- 0.03 (indicating very high classification accuracy). The classifier showed 95% +/- 5% sensitivity, 96% +/- 3% specificity, and 95% +/- 3% accuracy for the classification. Conclusion: EEG connectivity analysis via a combination of source/connectivity biomarkers, highly correlating with neuropsychological AD diagnosis, could represent a promising tool in identification of AD patients. This approach represents a low-cost and non-invasive method, one that utilizes widely available techniques which, when combined, reach high sensitivity/specificity and optimal classification accuracy on an individual basis (0.97 of AUC).

However, little is known about whether there is a deficit in the relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and RT in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Method: We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 28 older adults with MCI and 28 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) when they were performing an Eriksen flanker task. For each participant, single-trial prestimulus alpha power was calculated for combinations of congruency (congruent vs. incongruent) and response speed (fast vs. slow). Result: Statistical analysis indicated that prestimulus alpha power was significantly lower for fast trials than slow trials in HCs but not in older adults with MCI. The Fisher's z scores of the within-subject correlation coefficients between single-trial prestimulus alpha power and RT were significantly larger in HCs than in older adults with MCI. In addition, machine learning analyses indicated that prestimulus alpha power and its correlation with RT could serve as features to distinguish older adults with MCI from HCs and to predict performance on some neuropsychological tests. Conclusion: The reduced correlation between prestimulus alpha activity and RT suggests that older adults with MCI experience impaired preparatory attention.

The inputs are facial-video and EEG signals from the subjects when they are watching the emotion-stimulated video. The outputs are the corresponding emotion recognition results. Facial-video features and corresponding EEG features are extracted based on a fully connected neural network (FC) at each time point. These features are fused through hierarchical LSTM to predict the key emotional signal frames at the next time point until the emotion recognition result is calculated at the last time point. Specially, a self-attention mechanism is applied to show the correlation of the stacked LSTM at different hierarchies. In this process, the "selective focus" is used to analyze the human-emotional temporal sequences in each model, which improves the utilization of the key spatial EEG signals. Moreover, the process includes the temporal attention mechanism to predict the key signal frame at next time point, which utilizes the key emotion data in temporal domain. The experimental results prove that the classification rate (CR) and F1-score of the proposed emotion recognition model are significantly increased by at least 2% and 0.015, respectively, compared to other methods.

To address this problem, experimental designs often include repeated trials, which are then averaged to improve the SNR or to infer statistics that can be used in the design of a denoising spatial filter. However, collecting enough repeated trials is often impractical and even impossible in some paradigms, while analyses on existing data sets may be hampered when these do not contain such repeated trials. Therefore, we present a data-driven method that takes advantage of the knowledge of the presented stimulus, to achieve a joint noise reduction and dimensionality reduction without the need for repeated trials. The method first estimates the stimulus-driven neural response using the given stimulus, which is then used to find a set of spatial filters that maximize the SNR based on a generalized eigenvalue decomposition. As the method is fully data-driven, the dimensionality reduction enables researchers to perform their analyses without having to rely on their knowledge of brain regions of interest, which increases accuracy and reduces the human factor in the results. In the context of neural tracking of a speech stimulus using EEG, our method resulted in more accurate short-term temporal response function (TRF) estimates, higher correlations between predicted and actual neural responses, and higher attention decoding accuracies compared to existing TRF-based decoding methods. We also provide an extensive discussion on the central role played by the generalized eigenvalue decomposition in various denoising methods in the literature, and address the conceptual similarities and differences with our proposed method.

In particular, the study was focused on the signals generated in the cortex by eye blinking, which can be collected by frontopolar scalp Electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors. Normally, EEG recording systems meant for clinical applications are expensive and cannot be used in large-scale user-friendly applications. Thanks to a prototype made by the STMicroelectronics company, based on an Open Source EEG project, a low-cost EEG recording system was created in this work. The goal is to develop an algorithm that can detect and discriminate between voluntary (forced) and involuntary (natural) blinking so that, in the future, an EEG-based BCI system that is able to control a device through eye movements could be developed, which would be of great use for all people with motor disabilities who can control eye movements. The proposed algorithm is based on a one-dimensional (1D) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Frontopolar EEG signals were collected during the execution of voluntary and spontaneous blinks by four healthy subjects. A dataset of EEG epochs of including blinks was constructed and used to train and validate the proposed CNN. The proposed system allowed to discriminate the blinks performed by the subjects (voluntary vs. involuntary) with an average accuracy of 97.92 %.

Previous studies on prediction of the visual memorability have generally exploited visual features (e.g., color intensity, contrast) or semantic information (e.g., class labels) that can be obtained from multimedia contents. Compared to previous work, we propose a novel approach to predict the visual memorability of multimedia contents by exploiting human biological feedback. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are recorded from subjects as human biological feedback during a visual memory task. The collected EEG signals are then used to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for prediction of the visual memorability. In our experiment, 21 subjects were recruited to conduct a visual memory task where each subject is asked to answer if he/she correctly remember a particular image 30 minutes after glancing at a set of images sampled from LaMem dataset. Finally, the performance of deep CNNs trained with EEG signals were compared with classical methods such as SVM, LDA, and kNN algorithms. From the experimental results, we found that 1) a deep CNN-based framework outperforms classical machine learning methods and 2) the performance of the EEG-based framework is comparable to the previous studies which exploit visual features.

However, current biometric forms of authentication become unusable once compromised. Additional limits are realized when an attacker coerces an authorized user into a forced authentication. To resolve both issues, we propose creating an authentication mechanism that depends on the user's neurophysiological responses to chosen pieces of music (non-lyrical) measured using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This research paper provides a guide for creating and presenting a system that incorporates such idea for person classification and authentication. In a group study, the aim is that participant listen to individually selected music and music selected by other participants during an EEG reading. The change in the Alpha and Beta band frequencies across eight electrode EEG sensors serves as the input feature vector for a supervised machine learning algorithm that trains on the user and attacker EEG readings. Ultimately, the goal of the algorithm is to create a user-specific model to uniquely identify the respective user based on the corresponding EEG response to music and grant authentication. Our study lays a solid foundation for creating a promising EEG-based authentication system by solving the drawbacks of current biometric authentication methods.

This paper proposes a model based on non-dyadic wavelet decomposition for specifying left-hand and right-hand movement detection using motor imagery EEG signals. Three key components define our model: (1) The preprocessing and non-dyadic wavelet decomposition of EEG signals, (2) feature extraction using the common spatial pattern (CSP) coefficients of wavelet decomposed signals, (3) classification of test signal using selected features. The wavelet decomposition is done on the basis of m-band filtering. Classification of extracted features is done using different classifiers and obtained results are compared in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the kappa value. The proposed model gives the highest classification accuracy of 85.6% using decision tree classifier for BCI Competition 4 dataset IIa and BCI Competition 3 dataset IVa.

J	Wang, J; Wei, QG				Wang, Jin; Wei, Qingguo			Classification of EEG Signals Based on Filter Bank and Sparse Representation in Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; motor imagery; common spatial pattern; filter banks; sparse representation	EXISTENCE; RHYTHMS	To improve the classification performance of motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), a new signal processing algorithm for classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) signals by combining filter bank and sparse representation is proposed. The broadband EEG signals of 830Hz are segmented into 10 sub-band signals using a filter bank. EEG signals in each sub-band are spatially filtered by common spatial pattern (CSP). Fisher score combined with grid search is used for selecting the optimal sub-band, the band power of which is employed for designing a dictionary matrix. A testing signal can be sparsely represented as a linear combination of some columns of the dictionary. The sparse coefficients are estimated by l(1) norm optimization, and the residuals of sparse coefficients are exploited for classification. The proposed classification algorithm was applied to two BCI datasets and compared with two traditional broadband CSP-based algorithms. The results showed that the proposed algorithm provided superior classification accuracies, which were better than those yielded by traditional algorithms, verifying the efficacy of the present algorithm.

Most studies depend on one-dimensional raw data and required fine feature extraction. To solve this problem, in the EEG visualization research field, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelet, and coherence commonly used as method s for transferring EEG data to 2D images. However, we devised a new way from the concept that EEG's asymmetry was considered one of the major biomarkers of depression. This study proposes a deep-asymmetry methodology that converts the EEG's asymmetry feature into a matrix image and uses it as input to a convolutional neural network. The asymmetry matrix image in the alpha band achieved 98.85% accuracy and outperformed most of the methods presented in previous studies. This study indicates that the proposed method can be an effective tool for pre-screening major depressive disorder patients.

In recent years, several inconsistencies were found across different EEG studies, which authors often attributed to methodological differences. However, the assessment of such discrepancies is deeply underexplored. It is currently unknown if methodological differences can fully explain emerging differences and the nature of these differences. This study aims to contrast widely used methodological approaches in EEG processing and compare their effects on the outcome variables. To this end, two publicly available datasets were collected, each having unique traits so as to validate the results in two different EEG territories. The first dataset included signals with event-related potentials (visual stimulation) from 45 subjects. The second dataset included resting state EEG signals from 16 subjects. Five EEG processing steps, involved in the computation of power and phase quantities of EEG frequency bands, were explored in this study: artifact removal choices (with and without artifact removal), EEG signal transformation choices (raw EEG channels, Hjorth transformed channels, and averaged channels across primary motor cortex), filtering algorithms (Butterworth filter and Blackman-Harris window), EEG time window choices (-750 ms to 0 ms and -250 ms to 0 ms), and power spectral density (PSD) estimation algorithms (Welch's method, Fast Fourier Transform, and Burg's method). Powers and phases estimated by carrying out variations of these five methods were analyzed statistically for all subjects. The results indicated that the choices in EEG transformation and time-window can strongly affect the PSD quantities in a variety of ways. Additionally, EEG transformation and filter choices can influence phase quantities significantly. These results raise the need for a consistent and standard EEG processing pipeline for computational EEG studies. Consistency of signal processing methods cannot only help produce comparable results and reproducible research, but also pave the way for federated machine learning methods, e.g., where model parameters rather than data are shared.

Recording and analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the proper functional methods to detect such disorders, which merits independency from subjects variability. This study considers classification of ADHD and healthy subjects by using EEG signals and temporal and frequency features such as common spatial pattern (CSP), selective nonlinear attributes, and through usage of filter banks and time windowing approaches. In order to evaluate our proposed method, we applied it on a benchmark dataset, namely NBML, which consists of 328 epochs of recorded EEG signals from 61 subjects in two classes of ADHD and healthy. The proposed method achieved the discrimination accuracy of 83.33% of the two classes by using the proposed KNN classifier, which proved superior to previously reported results on the same dataset.

The method proposes the use of pattern images, generated with the common spatial pattern (CSP) technique. The paper also suggests a new algorithm to determine the best frequency bands for optimal discrimination among the diverse motor imageries to classify. The pattern images and the state images, which represent the mental state of the user in a specific segment of time, are used to compute cross-correlation coefficients. Feature vectors, including characteristics obtained with CSP, and the mean and variance of the correlation coefficients were employed to design binary classifiers with support vector machines. In addition, the work includes a real-time simulation involving a sliding window technique. The proposed method was evaluated in four datasets: IVa, IVb and V from BCI Competition III and another provided by the software BCILAB, which compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The results that overcome surpassed the methods in these competitions and other state-of-the-art methods mentioned in this paper. The method also presents short computation time, robustness between subjects and capability to classify between multiple mental states.

There is no effective strategy for selecting the number of channels and spatial filters in feature extraction of multichannel EEG data. Therefore, this paper combined sparse idea and greedy search algorithm to improve the feature extraction of common space pattern. The feature extraction can effectively overcome the repeating selection problem of feature pattern in the eigenvector space by the traditional method. Then we used the Fisher linear discriminant analysis to realize the classification. The results show that the proposed method can get high classification accuracy using fewer data. For 10 subjects, the averaged accuracy of epilepsy detection is more than 99%. So, the detection of an epileptic seizure based on sparse features using Fisher linear discriminant analysis classifiers is more suitable for a reliable, automatic epileptic seizure detection system to enhance the patient's care and the quality of life.

Non-linear online low-frequency EEG decoding of arm movements during a pursuit tracking task	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Decoding upper-limb movements in invasive recordings has become a reality, but neural tuning in non-invasive low-frequency recordings is still under discussion. Recent studies managed to decode movement positions and velocities using linear decoders, even developing an online system. The decoded signals, however, exhibited smaller amplitudes than actual movements, affecting feedback and user experience. Recently, we showed that a non-linear offline decoder can combine directional (e.g., velocity) and non-directional (e.g., speed) information. In this study, it is assessed if the nonlinear decoder can be used online to provide real-time feedback. Five healthy subjects were asked to track a moving target by controlling a robotic arm. Initially, the robot was controlled by their right hand; then, the control was gradually switched until it was entirely controlled by the electroencephalogram (EEG). Correlations between actual and decoded movements were generally above chance level. Results suggest that information about speed was also encoded in the EEG, demonstrating that the proposed non-linear decoder is suitable for decoding real-time arm movements.

However, the performance remains insufficient for real-time decoding owing to the endogenous signal characteristics compared to other BMI paradigms. This study aims to enhance the MRCP decoding performance from the perspective of preprocessing techniques (i.e., spectral filtering). To the best of our knowledge, existing MRCP studies have used spectral filters with a fixed frequency bandwidth for all subjects. Hence, we propose a subject-dependent and section-wise spectral filtering (SSSF) method that considers the subjects' individual MRCP characteristics for two different temporal sections. In this study, MRCP data were acquired under a powered exoskeleton environments in which the subjects conducted self-initiated walking. We evaluated our method using both our experimental data and a public dataset (BNCI Horizon 2020). The decoding performance using the SSSF was 0.86 (+/- 0.09), and the performance on the public dataset was 0.73 (+/- 0.06) across all subjects. The experimental results showed a statistically significant enhancement ( ${p} < {0.01}$ ) compared with the fixed frequency bands used in previous methods on both datasets. In addition, we presented successful decoding results from a pseudo-online analysis. Therefore, we demonstrated that the proposed SSSF method can involve more meaningful MRCP information than conventional methods.

EEG has emerged as a useful tool for objective pain assessment, but due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of pain-related EEG signals, the prediction accuracy of EEG-based pain prediction models is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we proposed an autoencoder model based on convolutional neural networks for feature extraction of pain-related EEG signals. More precisely, we used EEGNet to build an autoencoder model to extract a small set of features from high-density pain-evoked EEG potentials and then establish a machine learning models to predict pain levels ( high pain vs. low pain) from extracted features. Experimental results show that the new autoencoder-based approach can effectively identify pain-related features and can achieve better classification results than conventional methods.

However, previous studies have shown low classification performance, therefore its use in real-life is not feasible. In addition, no suitable method to analyze it has been found. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied to this paradigm. However, due to the small amount of data, the increase in classification performance is limited. To tackle these issues, in this study, we proposed an end-to-end framework using Siamese neural network encoder, which learns the discriminant features by considering the distance between classes. The imagined words (e.g., arriba (up), abajo (down), derecha (right), izquierda ( left), adelante (forward), and atras (backward)) were classified using the raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We obtained a 6-class classification accuracy of 31.40 +/- 2.73% for imagined speech, which significantly outperformed other methods. This was possible because the Siamese neural network, which increases the distance between dissimilar samples while decreasing the distance between similar samples, was used. In this regard, our method can learn discriminant features from a small dataset. The proposed framework would help to increase the classification performance of imagined speech for a small amount of data and implement an intuitive communication system.

Numerous algorithms using EEG signals to detect seizures have been developed in recent decades. However, most of them require well-designed features that highly depend on domain-specific knowledge and algorithm expertise. In this study, we introduce the unigram ordinal pattern (UniOP) and bigram ordinal pattern (BiOP) representations to capture the different underlying dynamics of time series, which only assumes that time series derived from different dynamics can be characterized by repeated ordinal patterns. Specifically, we first transform each subsequence in a time series into the corresponding ordinal pattern in terms of the ranking of values and consider the distribution of ordinal patterns of all subsequences as the UniOP representation. Furthermore, we consider the distribution of the cooccurrence of ordinal patterns as the BiOP representation to characterize the contextual information for each ordinal pattern. We then combine the proposed representations with the nearest neighbor algorithm to evaluate its effectiveness on three publicly available seizure datasets. The results on the Bonn EEG dataset demonstrate that this method provides more than 90% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in most cases and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, which proves its ability to capture the key information of the underlying dynamics of EEG time series at healthy, seizure-free, and seizure states. The results on the second dataset are comparable with the state-of-the-art method, showing the good generalization ability of the proposed method. All performance metrics on the third dataset are approximately 89%, which demonstrates that the proposed representations are suitable for large-scale datasets.

To address this issue for building an emotion recognition system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) features, we propose a shared-subspace feature elimination (SSFE) approach to identify EEG variables with common characteristics across multiple individuals. In the SSFE framework, a low-dimensional space defined by a selected number of EEG features is created to represent the inter-emotion discriminant for different pairs of subjects evaluated based on the interclass margin. Using two public databases-DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI-the performance of the SSFE is validated according to the leave-one-subject-out paradigm. The performance of the proposed framework is compared with five other feature-selection methods. The effectiveness and computational cost of the SSFE is investigated across six machine learning models based on their optimal hyperparameters. In the end, the competitive binary classification accuracy from the SSFE of arousal and valence recognitions are determined to be 0.6521 and 0.6635, respectively, for DEAP, and 0.6520 and 0.6537, respectively for MAHNOB-HCI.

Methods: Seven experts estimated the postmenstrual ages (PMA) in a cohort of recordings from preterm infants using cloud-based review software. The FBA was calculated using a machine learning-based algorithm. Error analysis was used to determine the accuracy of PMA assessments and intraclass correlation (ICC) was used to assess agreement between experts. Results: EEG recordings from a PMA range 25 to 38 weeks were successfully interpreted. In 179 recordings from 62 infants interpreted by all human readers, there was moderate agreement between experts (aEEG ICC = 0.724; 95%CI:0.658-0.781 and EEG ICC = 0.517; 95%CI:0.311-0.664). In 149 recordings from 61 infants interpreted by all human readers and the FBA algorithm, random and systematic errors in visual interpretation of PMA were significantly higher than the computational FBA estimate. Tracking of maturation in individual infants showed stable FBA trajectories, but the trajectories of the experts' PMA estimate were more likely to be obscured by random errors. The accuracy of visual interpretation of PMA estimation was compromised by neurodevelopmental outcome for both aEEG and EEG review. Interpretation: Visual assessment of infant maturity is possible from the EEG or aEEG, with an average of human experts providing the highest accuracy. Tracking PMA of individual infants was hampered by errors in experts' estimates. FBA provided the most accurate maturity assessment and has potential as a biomarker of early outcome.

However, the classification method based on feature extraction requires a lot of prior knowledge when extracting data features and lacks a good measurement standard, which makes the development of BCI. In particular, the development of a multi-classification brain-computer interface is facing a bottleneck. To avoid the blindness and complexity of electroencephalogram (EEG) feature extraction, the deep learning method is applied to the automatic feature extraction of EEG signals. It is necessary to design a classification model with strong robustness and high accuracy for EEG signals. Based on the research and implementation of a BCI system based on a convolutional neural network, this article aims to design a brain-computer interface system that can automatically extract features of EEG signals and classify EEG signals accurately. It can avoid the blindness and time-consuming problems caused by the machine learning method based on feature extraction of EEG data due to the lack of a large amount of prior knowledge.

Daily movements are commonly executed during social interactions and are determined by different mental states that may express different positive or negative behavioral intent. In this context, the effective recognition of festive or violent intent before the action execution remains crucial for survival. Here, we hypothesize that the EEG signals contain the distinctive features characterizing movement intent already expressed before movement execution and that such distinctive information can be identified by state-of-the-art classification algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. We demonstrated for the first time that a classifier based on covariance matrices and Riemannian geometry can effectively discriminate between neutral, festive, and violent mental states only on the basis of non-invasive EEG signals in both the actor and observer participants. These results pave the way for new electrophysiological discrimination of mental states based on non-invasive EEG recordings and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

Previous research has shown that using different visual scenarios during mental practices that involve imagining the movement of a specific body part may result in differences in performance. Many of these scenarios utilize the concept of embodiment, or one's observation of another entity to be a part of oneself, to improve practice quality of the imagined body movement. We therefore hypothesized that applying immersive virtual reality headsets, with their ability to provide rich immersion and illusion by presenting egocentrically simulated virtual scenarios, and action observation to motor imagery practice will result in significant improvement. To explore the possible synergy between immersive systems and motor imagery, we analyzed the electroencephalogram signals of our participants as they were presented the same virtual hand movement scenario with two different mediums: an immersive virtual reality headset and a monitor display. Our experimental results provide evidence that the immersive virtual reality headsets induced improved rhythmic patterns with better discriminating spatial features from the brain compared to the monitor display. These findings suggest that the use of immersive virtual reality headsets, with the illusion and embodiment they provide, can effectively improve motor imagery training.

This study investigates neural oscillations changes related to memory process. Participants were asked to perform a memory task for encoding and decoding phase while EEG signals were recorded. Results showed that for encoding phase, there was a significant decrease of power in low beta, high beta bands over fronto-central area and a decrease in low beta, high beta and gamma bands over left temporal area related to successful subsequent memory effects. For decoding phase, only significant decreases of alpha power were observed over fronto-central area.

Methods: A total of 97 children aged from 3 to 6 were enrolled in the present study. After resting-state EEG data recording, the children performed eye-tracking tests individually on own-race and other-race stranger faces stimuli. Power spectrum analysis was used for EEG analysis and areas of interest (AOI) were selected for face gaze analysis of eye-tracking data. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) feature selection method combined with SVM classifiers were used for classification of autistic versus typically developing children. Results: Results showed that classification accuracy from combining two types of data reached a maximum of 85.44%, with AUC = 0.93, when 32 features were selected. Limitations: The sample consisted of children aged from 3 to 6, and no younger patients were included. Conclusions: Our machine learning approach, combining EEG and eye-tracking data, may be a useful tool for the identification of children with ASD, and may help for diagnostic processes.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has recently shown great potential as a non-invasive neuroimaging modality for neural speech decoding, owing in part to its spatial selectivity over other high-temporal resolution devices. Standard MEG systems have a large number of cryogenically cooled channels/sensors (200 - 300) encapsulated within a fixed liquid helium dewar, precluding their use as wearable BCI devices. Fortunately, recently developed optically pumped magnetometers (OPM) do not require cryogens, and have the potential to be wearable and movable making them more suitable for BCI applications. This design is also modular allowing for customized montages to include only the sensors necessary for a particular task. As the number of sensors bears a heavy infiuence on the cost, size, and weight of MEG systems, minimizing the number of sensors is critical for designing practical MEG-based BCIs in the future. In this study, we sought to identify an optimal set of MEG channels to decode imagined and spoken phrases from the MEG signals. Using a forward selection algorithm with a support vector machine classifier we found that nine optimally located MEG gradiometers provided higher decoding accuracy compared to using all channels. Additionally, the forward selection algorithm achieved similar performance to dimensionality reduction using a stacked-sparse-autoencoder. Analysis of spatial dynamics of speech decoding suggested that both left and right hemisphere sensors contribute to speech decoding. Sensors approximately located near Broca's area were found to be commonly contributing among the higher-ranked sensors across all subjects.

Conventional methods utilize waveforms template matching or machine learning for detecting spindles. In the former approach, it is necessary to tune thresholds for individual adaptation, while the latter approach has the problem of imbalanced data because the amount of sleep spindles is small compared with the entire EEG data. The present work proposes a sleep spindle detection method that combines wavelet synchrosqueezed transform (SST) and random under-sampling boosting (RUSBoost). SST is a time-frequency analysis method suitable for extracting features of spindle waveforms. RUSBoost is a framework for coping with the imbalanced data problem. The proposed SST-RUS can deal with the imbalanced data in spindle detection and does not require threshold tuning because RUSBoost uses majority voting of weak classifiers for discrimination. The performance of SST-RUS was validated using an open-access database called the Montreal archives of sleep studies cohort 1 (MASS-C1), which showed an F-measure of 0.70 with a sensitivity of 76.9% and a positive predictive value of 61.2%. The proposed method can reduce the burden of PSG scoring.

J	Fira, M; Goras, L				Fira, Monica; Goras, Liviu			ECG and EEG Pattern Classifications and Dimensionality Reduction with Laplacian Eigenmaps	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Laplacian Eigenmaps; dimensionality reduction; biosignals; electrocardiographic signal (ECG); electroencephalogram (EEG)		In this paper, we investigate the effect of dimensionality reduction using Laplacian Eigenmap (LE) in the case of several classes of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. Classification results based on a boosting method for EEG signals exhibiting P300 wave and k-nearest neighbour for ECG signals belonging to 8 classes are computed and compared. For EEG signals, the difference between the rate of classification in the original and reduced space with LE is relatively small, only several percent (maximum 10% for the 3 - dimensional space), and the original EEG signals belonging to a 128-dimensional space. This means that, for classification purposes the dimensionality of EEG signals can be reduced without significantly affecting the global and local arrangement of data. Moreover, for EEG signals that are collected at high frequencies, a first stage of data preprocessing can be done by reducing the dimensionality. For ECG signals, for segmentation with and without centering of the R wave, there is a slight decrease in the classification rate at small data sizes. It is found that for an initial dimensionality of 301 the size of the signals can be reduced to 30 without significantly affecting the classification rate. Below this dimension there is a decrease of the classification rate but still the results are very good even for very small dimensions, such as 3. It has been found that the classification results in the reduced space are remarkable close to those obtained for the initial spaces even for small dimensions.

Several evolutions used for our research mechanism technology to describe two different primaries: one used for combining the vital attribute, frequency sphere, and physical element of the EEG signals, and the architecture describes the two-dimensional image. Emotion realization is imposing effort in the computer brain interface field, which is mostly used to understand the field of education, medical military, and many others. The allocation issue arises in the required area of emotion recognition. In this paper, the allocation structure based on Caps Net neural network is described. The heder factor shows that the best point to classified the original EEG signals scarce group to using many of the algorithms like Lasso for a better function to used and other than occupy the heights.Furthermore, essential features like tiny subset take by input for the computer network attain for many ultimate emotional classifications. Many of the results show to alternate the best parameters model use and other network formats to making the Caps Net and another neural network act as the emotional valuation on EEG signals. It attains almost 80.22% and 85.41% average allocation efficiency under demeanor and view of the emotion pathway as compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network(CNN or ConvNet). A significant allocation edge attains the best conclusion and automatically enhances the performance of the EEG emotional classification. Deep learning access, such as CNN has widely used to improve primary allocation performance of motor symbolism-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI). As we know that CNN's limited allocation achievement degraded when an essential point data is distorted. Basically, in the electroencephalography (EEG) case, the signals consist of the same user are not measure. So we implement the Capsule networks (CapsNet), which is essential to extract many features. By that, it attains a much more powerful and positive performance than the old CNN approaches.

However, on imagined body movements the brain produces the same EEG patterns as the action performed. This study aims to differentiate real movements from imagined ones, through EEG signals. Three different models; Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest neighbour were implemented to classify these events. The preliminary results, obtained from 15 participants, revealed that the Logistic Regression was the best classifier into the proposed model with accuracy rates varying from 36.8 to 90%. Finally, complementary studies should be addressed to optimize not only the accuracy but also to assure uniform accuracy among the different participants.

In particular, BCI has been widely used to detect the intention of users in motor imagery (MI)-based tasks. Although the MI classification accuracy has been largely enhanced from previous efforts, MI-BCI studies have focused on extracting features only during MI tasks, not during the preparatory phases. The increment of alpha band power is induced by performing a task with attention. This study proposes a n approach for increasing MI-BCI performance by analyzing brain state in preparatory before the task. EEG recordings of nine healthy subjects from the open BCI dataset were investigated. The alpha lateralization index (ALI) was calculated for each trial and high ALI trials were utilized for learning lateralization-based model. MI classification accuracy using the lateralization-based model marked high performance (median accuracy = 63.2 %; interquartile range (IQR) = 50.0% - 54.8%) than the total trial-based approach (median accuracy = 52.0%; IQR = 50.0 % - 54.8%) with statistical significance (p = 0.018). This study suggests alpha lateralization which is an imbalance pattern between ipsilateral and contralateral is one of the main factors for improvement of performance. Accordingly, since the alpha liberalization before MI task could exert an effect on the MI phase, the analysis combined preparation with MI would derive highly benefit for the MI classification.

The participant-specific time window relative to the visual cue has a significant impact on the effectiveness of the CSP. However, the time window is usually selected experientially or manually. To solve this problem, we propose a novel feature selection approach for MI-based BCIs. Specifically, multiple time segments were obtained by decomposing each EEG sample of the MI task. Furthermore, the features were extracted by CSP from each time segment and were combined to form a new feature vector. Finally, the optimal temporal combination patterns for the new feature vector were selected based on four feature selection algorithms, i.e., mutual information, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, principal component analysis and stepwise linear discriminant analysis (denoted as MUIN, LASSO, PCA, and SWLDA, respectively), and the classification algorithm was employed to evaluate the average classification accuracy. With three BCI competition datasets, the results of the four proposed algorithms were compared with traditional CSP algorithm in classification accuracy. Experimental results show that compared with traditional algorithm, the proposed methods significantly improve performance. Specifically, the LASSO achieved the highest accuracy (88.58%) among the proposed methods. Importantly, the average classification accuracies using the proposed approaches significantly improved 10.14% (MUIN), 11.40% (LASSO), 6.08% (PCA), and 10.25% (SWLDA) compared to that using CSP. These results indicate that the proposed approach is expected to be practical in MI-based BCIs.

Moreover, it is difficult and stressful for the disabled to drive agricultural machinery. Besides, current artificial intelligence technology could not fully realize tractor autonomous driving because of a high uncertain filed environment and short interruptions of satellite navigation signal shaded by trees. To reduce manual operations, a tractor assistant driving control method was proposed based on the human-machine interface utilizing the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. First, the EEG signals of the tractor drivers were collected by a low-cost brain-computer interface (BCI), followed by denoising using a wavelet packet. Then the spectral features of EEG signals were calculated and extracted as the input of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Finally, the EEG-aided RNN driving model was trained for tractor driving robot control such as straight going, brake, left turn, and right turn operations, which control accuracy was 94.5% and time cost was 0.61 ms. Also, 8 electrodes were selected by the PCA algorithm for the design of a portable EEG controller. And the control accuracy reached 93.1% with the time cost of 0.48 ms. To solve the incomplete driving data set in the actual world because some driving manners may cause dangerous or even death, RNN-TL algorithm was employed by creating the complete driving data in the virtual environment followed by transferring the driving control experience to the actual world with small actual driving data set in the field, which control accuracy was 93.5% and time consumption was 0.48 ms. The experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed tractor driving control method based on EEG signal combined with RNN-TL deep learning algorithm which can work with the displacement error less than 6.7 mm when the tractor speed is less than 50 km/h.

Two experiments were conducted: The first aimed to select an EEG channel based on the brain wave indices when the indoor environmental quality (IEQ) changes. We then extract the brain wave indices' feature when the subjects conduct adaptive behaviors and predict the IEQ condition control using machine learning including the stacked ensembles. The extracted features were classified using base estimators such as distributed random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), generalized linear models (GLMs), deep neural network, and new predicted data were retrained and predicted by metalearner (i.e., GLM). In Dimension 1, the air conditioning system and the air ventilation system, and the area under curve (AUC) of the proposed stacked ensembles trained by base estimators was the highest, 0.9038. In Dimension 2, turning on and turning off, the AUC of the GBM is the highest, 0.8384. Based on these results, the EEG signal can be used to suggest an automatic IEQ control model that can then reduce the drowsiness, and increase attention.

Detection of Transient Bursts in the EEG of Preterm Infants using Time-Frequency Distributions and Machine Learning	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Short-duration bursts of spontaneous activity are important markers of maturation in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of premature infants. This paper examines the application of a feature-less machine learning approach for detecting these bursts. EEGs were recorded over the first 3 days of life for infants with a gestational age below 30 weeks. Bursts were annotated on the EEG from 36 infants. In place of feature extraction, the time-series EEG is transformed into a time-frequency distribution (TFD). A gradient boosting machine is then trained directly on the whole TFD using a leave-one-out procedure. TFD kernel parameters, length of the Doppler and lag windows, are selected within a nested cross-validation procedure during training. Results indicate that detection performance is sensitive to Doppler-window length but not lag-window length. Median area under the receiver operator characteristic for detection is 0.881 (inter-quartile range 0.850 to 0.913).

We propose to estimate the support with an oracle based on a deep neural network trained jointly with the linear mapping at the encoder. The divination of the oracle is then used to estimate the coefficients by pseudo-inversion. This architecture allows the definition of an encoding-decoding scheme with state-of-the-art recovery capabilities when applied to biological signals such as ECG and EEG, thus allowing extremely low-complex encoders. As an additional feature, oracle-based recovery is able to self-assess, by indicating with remarkable accuracy chunks of signals that may have been reconstructed with a non-satisfactory quality. This self-assessment capability is unique in the CS literature and paves the way for further improvements depending on the requirements of the specific application. As an example, our scheme is able to satisfyingly compress by a factor of 2.67 an ECG or EEG signal with a complexity equivalent to only 24 signed sums per processed sample.

There is an unmet need to develop seizure detection algorithms from brain regions outside the epileptogenic cortex. The study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of classifying seizures and interictal states from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the human thalamus-a subcortical region remote to the epileptogenic cortex. We tested the hypothesis that spectral and entropy-based features extracted from LFPs recorded from the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) can distinguish its state of ictal recruitment from other interictal states (including awake, sleep). Approach. Two supervised machine learning tools (random forest and the random kitchen sink) were used to evaluate the performance of spectral (discrete wavelet transform-DWT), and time-domain (multiscale entropy-MSE) features in classifying seizures from interictal states in patients undergoing stereo-electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Under the supervision of IRB, field potentials were recorded from the ANT in consenting adults with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizures were confirmed in the ANT using line-length and visual inspection. Wilcoxon rank-sum method was used to test the differences in spectral patterns between seizure and interictal (awake and sleep) states. Main results. 79 seizures (10 patients) and 158 segments (approx. 4 h) of interictal stereo-EEG data were analyzed. The mean seizure detection latencies with line length in the ANT varied between seizure types (range 5-34 s). However, the DWT and MSE in the ANT showed significant changes for all seizure types within the first 20 s after seizure onset. The random forest (accuracy 93.9% and false-positive 4.6%) and the random kitchen sink (accuracy 97.3% and false-positive 1.8%) classified seizures and interictal states. Significance. These results suggest that features extracted from the thalamic LFPs can be trained to detect seizures that can be used for monitoring seizure counts and for closed-loop seizure abortive interventions.

However, the different network patterns under different emotional states in the high gamma band (50-80 Hz) remain unclear. In this paper, we investigate different emotional states using functional network analysis on various frequency bands. We constructed multiple functional networks on different frequency bands and performed functional network analysis and time-frequency analysis on these frequency bands to determine the significant features that represent different emotional states. Furthermore, we verified the effectiveness of these features by using them in emotion recognition. Our experimental results revealed that the network connections in the high gamma band with significant differences among the positive, neutral, and negative emotional states were much denser than the network connections in the other frequency bands. The connections mainly occurred in the left prefrontal, left temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Moreover, long-distance connections with significant differences among the emotional states were observed in the high frequency bands, particularly in the high gamma band. Additionally, high gamma band fusion features derived from the global efficiency, network connections, and differential entropies achieved the highest classification accuracies for both our dataset and the public dataset. These results are consistent with literature and provide further evidence that high gamma band EEG signals are more sensitive and effective than the EEG signals in other frequency bands in studying human affective perception.

However, EEG decoding is a challenging task because of its complexity, dynamic nature, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Designing an end-to-end framework that fully extracts the high-level features of EEG signals remains a challenge. In this study, we present a parallel spatial-temporal self-attention-based convolutional neural network for four-class MI EEG signal classification. This study is the first to define a new spatial-temporal representation of raw EEG signals that uses the self-attention mechanism to extract distinguishable spatial-temporal features. Specifically, we use the spatial self-attention module to capture the spatial dependencies between the channels of MI EEG signals. This module updates each channel by aggregating features over all channels with a weighted summation, thus improving the classification accuracy and eliminating the artifacts caused by manual channel selection. Furthermore, the temporal self-attention module encodes the global temporal information into features for each sampling time step, so that the high-level temporal features of the MI EEG signals can be extracted in the time domain. Quantitative analysis shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for intra-subject and inter-subject classification, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. In terms of qualitative analysis, we perform a visual inspection of the new spatial-temporal representation estimated from the learned architecture. Finally, the proposed method is employed to realize control of drones based on EEG signal, verifying its feasibility in real-time applications.

J	Belwafi, K; Gannouni, S; Aboalsamh, H				Belwafi, Kais; Gannouni, Sofien; Aboalsamh, Hatim			An Effective Zeros-Time Windowing Strategy to Detect Sensorimotor Rhythms Related to Motor Imagery EEG Signals	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); motor imagery; EEG-zero-time windowing; group-delay function	BRAIN; EXTRACTION	Brain-computer interface (BCI) acquires, analyzes and transforms human brain activity to control commands allowing as such disabled people to communicate or control external devices. A motor imagery-based BCI enables patients to control artificial peripherals and communicate with the outside world by merely thinking of the task such as, e.g., the imagination of left-hand, right-hand, or foot movement. The mere intention of moving one of the limbs triggers neural activity, which is induced in the primary sensorimotor areas like that observed with real executed movements. Tracking generated sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) and extracting robust and informative features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are challenging due to the time-varying nature of EEG signals and the inter-human variability. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-zeros-time windowing (E2ZTW) approach based on a highly decaying window function to track SMRs and identify the temporal epochs containing useful information without any prior information on the trigger. The proposed approach involves the application of the group-delay function, allowing the improvement of the spectral resolution due to the additive property of the function on individual resonances. Some algorithms were integrated into the proposed approach, such as the common spatial pattern algorithm, which is used to extract features and linear discriminant analysis and a convolutional neural network, which are used for the classification of the features. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in tracking the SMRs rhythms is evaluated in terms of accuracy. Experiments were performed on three public datasets provided by BCI competition for 17 subjects. Following experimental results, it is shown that discrimination between the left- and right-hand movements can be achieved within a few seconds with high classification accuracy. As compared to other state-of-art techniques, the proposed approach achieves an average classification accuracy and standard error values of 82% and 13, respectively, thereby outperforming existing algorithm by an accuracy mean of 2%.

We retrospectively reviewed 237 generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs) in 126 patients during long-term video-EEG (VEEG) recordings. The associations of PGES and prolonged PGES (duration >20 seconds) with person- and seizure-specific variables were evaluated independently using SPSS software. Eighty patients (63.5%, 80/126) exhibited PGES after 127 GCSs (53.6%, 127/237) with an average PGES duration of 41.31 +/- 24.03 seconds. The tonic phase was significantly prolonged in patients with PGES and prolonged PGES. PGES was independently associated with ictal semiology, which was attributable to the different proportions of GCS type 1. After seizure termination, patients with PGES had a higher percentage of postictal unresponsiveness and immobility, including oropharyngeal immobility. Between prolonged and short-duration PGES, the former was more likely to phase out gradually followed by immediate body movement, whereas the latter tended to have an abrupt, evoked termination followed by delayed body movement. Prolonged tonic duration, GCS type 1, postictal unresponsiveness, and immobility were more prone to occur with PGES, which might imply that hyperactivation of inhibitory neural networks underlies the pathophysiology of PGES and subsequent SUDEP. Any form of periictal bedside care, whether it constitutes effective medical intervention or not, is advisable due to its possible contribution to the interruption of PGES. Regardless of the PGES termination pattern, the neural network resuscitation process was progressive.

EEG based multi-class seizure type classification using convolutional neural network and transfer learning	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Convolution neural network; Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy; Seizure type; Support vector machine; Transfer learning	SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ILAE COMMISSION; POSITION PAPER; LOG ENERGY; ENTROPY; RECOGNITION; MODEL	Recognition of epileptic seizure type is essential for the neurosurgeon to understand the cortical connectivity of the brain. Though automated early recognition of seizures from normal electroencephalogram (EEG) was existing, no attempts have been made towards the classification of variants of seizures. Therefore, this study attempts to classify seven variants of seizures with non-seizure EEG through the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning by making use of the Temple University Hospital EEG corpus. The objective of our study is to perform a multiclass classification of epileptic seizure type, which includes simple partial, complex partial, focal non-specific, generalized non-specific, absence, tonic, and tonic-clonic, and non-seizures. The 19 channels EEG time series was converted into a spectrogram stack before feeding as input to CNN. The following two different modalities were proposed using CNN: (1) Transfer learning using pretrained network, (2) Extract image features using pretrained network and classify using the support vector machine classifier. The following ten pretrained networks were used to identify the optimal network for the proposed study: Alexnet, Vgg16, Vgg19, Squeezenet, Googlenet, Inceptionv3, Densenet201, Resnetl8, Resnet50, and Resnet101. The highest classification accuracy of 82.85% (using Googlenet) and 88.30% (using Inceptionv3) was achieved using transfer learning and extract image features approach respectively. Comparison results showed that CNN based approach outperformed conventional feature and clustering based approaches. It can be concluded that the EEG based classification of seizure type using CNN model could be used in pre-surgical evaluation for treating patients with epilepsy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Within this research topic, multiple MI classification is a challenge due to the difficulties caused by time-varying spatial features across different individuals. To deal with this challenge, we tried to fuse brain functional connectivity (BFC) and one-versus-the-rest filter-bank common spatial pattern (OVR-FBCSP) to improve the robustness of classification. The BFC features were extracted by phase locking value (PLV), representing the brain inter-regional interactions relevant to the MI, whilst the OVR-FBCSP is used to extract the spatial-frequency features related to the MI. These diverse features were then fed into a multi-kernel relevance vector machine (MK-RVM). The dataset with three motor imagery tasks (left hand MI, right hand MI, and feet MI) was used to assess the proposed method. Experimental results not only showed that the cascade structure of diverse feature fusion and MK-RVM achieved satisfactory classification performance (average accuracy: 83.81%, average kappa: 0.76), but also demonstrated that BFC plays a supplementary role in the MI classification. Moreover, the proposed method has a potential to be integrated into multiple MI online detection owing to the advantage of strong time-efficiency of RVM.

With these powerful techniques comes the danger of overfitting of hyperparameters which can render results invalid. We refer to this problem as 'overhyping' and show that it is pernicious despite commonly used precautions. Overhyping occurs when analysis decisions are made after observing analysis outcomes and can produce results that are partially or even completely spurious. It is commonly assumed that cross-validation is an effective protection against overfitting or overhyping, but this is not actually true. In this article, we show that spurious results can be obtained on random data by modifying hyperparameters in seemingly innocuous ways, despite the use of cross-validation. We recommend a number of techniques for limiting overhyping, such as lock boxes, blind analyses, pre-registrations, and nested cross-validation. These techniques, are common in other fields that use machine learning, including computer science and physics. Adopting similar safeguards is critical for ensuring the robustness of machine-learning techniques in the neurosciences.

For this aim, an experimental bearing test setup was created in this study. In this setup, vibration signals were obtained from the bearings on which artificial faults were generated in specific sizes. A new feature extraction method based on co-occurrence matrices for bearing vibration signals was proposed instead of the conventional feature extraction methods, as in the literature. The One (1) Dimensional-Local Binary Patterns (1D-LBP) method was first applied to bearing vibration signals, and a new signal whose values ranged between 0-255 was obtained. Then, co-occurrence matrices were obtained from these signals. The correlation, energy, homogeneity, and contrast features were extracted from these matrices. Different machine learning methods were employed with these features to carry out the classification process. Three different data sets were used to test the proposed approach. As a result of analysing the signals with the proposed model, the success rate is 87.50% for dataset1 (different speed), 96.5% for dataset2 (fault size (mm)) and 99.30% for dataset3 (fault type - inner ring, outer ring, ball) was found, respectively.

However, collecting labeled samples for classifier training and calibration is still difficult and time-consuming, especially for patients. As a promising alternative way to address the problem, semi-supervised learning has attracted much attention by exploiting both labeled and unlabeled samples in the training process. Nowadays, semi-supervised extreme learning machine (SS-ELM) is widely used in EEG classification due to its fast training speed and good generalization performance. However, the classification performance of SS-ELM largely depends on the quality of sample graph. The graphs of most semi-supervised algorithms are constructed by the similarity between labeled and unlabeled data called manifold graph. The more similar the structural information between samples, the greater probability they belong to the same class. In this paper, the label-consistency graph (LCG) and sample-similarity graph (SSG) are combined to constrain the model output. When the SSG is not accurate enough, the weight of LCG needs to be increased, and vice versa. The weight ratio of two graphs is optimized to obtain an optimal adjacency graph, and finally the best output weight vector is achieved. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it was validated and compared with several existing methods on two real datasets: BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a and BCI Competition III Dataset 4a. Experimental results show that our algorithm has achieved the promising results, especially when the number of labeled samples is small.

In this paper, we present a novel technique, termed common frequency pattern (CFP), to extract the variance features from a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal for sleep stage classification. The learning task is formulated by finding significant frequency patterns that maximize variance for one class and that at the same time, minimize variance for the other class. The proposed methodology for automated sleep scoring is tested on the benchmark Sleep-EDF database and finally achieves 97.9%, 94.22%, and 90.16% accuracy for two-state, three-state, and five-state classification of sleep stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method identifies discriminative characteristics of sleep stages robustly and achieves better performance as compared to the state-of-the-art sleep staging algorithms. Apart from the enhanced classification, the frequency patterns that are determined by the CFP algorithm is able to find the most significant bands of frequency for classification and could be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanisms of sleep stages.

Classification of visual cognitive workload using analytic wavelet transform	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram(EEG); Cognitive workload; Analytic wavelet transform (AWT); Ensemble subspace KNN	MENTAL WORKLOAD; BINARY PATTERN; EEG; FEATURES; SEIZURE	Visual stimuli are used to induce cognitive load of various levels to examine its effect on EEG signals. Four cognitive workload levels are generated by using different shapes and their arrangements in the visual field. Assessing the cognitive load imposed by visual demand is required for developing viable visual interfaces. In this experiment, EEG signals are acquired from 44 subjects by displaying them various cognitive level visual stimuli. The features for the same cognitive level vary significantly across subjects. This poses a complex problem for the classification of cognitive workload levels. The features for classification are obtained by decomposing EEG signals using the analytic wavelet transform. This transform allows to vary Q factor to improve high-frequency resolution. Kurtosis is used as a statistical feature. To capture local variations of the signal local binary pattern is used. The other features computed include morphological features such as curve length and non-linear energy. By using Ensemble subspace k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine, we have done 10-fold cross-validation for obtaining results. We have obtained comparable performance for similar studies. EEG channels are ranked based on weight obtained using neighborhood component feature selection method. The impact of the EEG channel on the detection of cognitive workload level is investigated.

The CSP algorithm assumes covariance matrices of the signal to have full rank. However, preprocessing techniques, such as artifact removal using independent component analysis, may decrease the rank of the signal, leading to potential errors in the CSP decomposition. We inspect what could go wrong when CSP implementations do not take this into consideration on a binary motor imagery classification task. We review CSP implementations in open-source toolboxes for EEG signal analysis (FieldTrip, BBCI Toolbox, BioSig, EEGLAB, BCILAB, and MNE). We show that unprotected implementations decreased mean classification accuracy by up to 32%, with spatial filters resulting in complex numbers, for which corresponding spatial patterns do not have a clear interpretation. We encourage researchers to check their implementations and analysis pipelines.

WU-NEAT: A clinically validated, open-source MATLAB toolbox for limited-channel neonatal EEG analysis	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Spectral edge frequency; Open source; Neonates; Quantitative methods; MATLAB	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED EEG; SPECTRAL EDGE FREQUENCY; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; PRETERM INFANTS; 1ST WEEK; LIFE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PREDICTS; INJURY	Background: Limited-channel EEG research in neonates is hindered by lack of open, accessible analytic tools. To overcome this limitation, we have created the Washington University-Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (WU-NEAT), containing two of the most commonly used tools, provided in an open-source, clinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first algorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by filtering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with subsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge frequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-defined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was validated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings of fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a reference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm. Using standard methodology, reviewers assigned a background pattern classification. Inter/intra-rater reliability was assessed. For the SEF, calculations were made using the same fourteen recordings, first with the reference and then with the WU-NEAT algorithm. Results were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: For the aEEG algorithm, intra- and inter-rater reliability was 100% and 98%, respectively. For the SEF, the meanISD Pearson correlation coefficient between algorithms was 0.96+0.04. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a clinically-validated toolbox for generating the aEEG as well as calculating the SEF from EEG data. Open-source access will enable widespread use of common analytic algorithms which are device-independent and unlikely to become outdated as technology changes, thereby facilitating future collaborative research in neonatal EEG.

This consideration may be a faulty approach for the paralyzed patient. This limitation demands an alternative approach for movement-related BCI. For the first time, we propose the prefrontal hemodynamics for implementing movement-related BCI. This paper aims to model the activation pattern and the classification performances of the prefrontal hemodynamics regarding the movement-related events. Utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) the changes in the concentration of the oxidized hemoglobin and deoxidized hemoglobin regarding voluntary and imagery movements are acquired. With necessary preprocessing, the fNIRS signals are statistically analyzed to localize the most significant activated regions regarding the applied stimuli. The experiment shows that movement-related events have a strong correlation with the prefrontal hemodynamics. The patterns of the movement-related hemodynamics are modeled by polynomial regression and used to classify the voluntary and imagery events based on the maximum similarity approach. The resulting classification accuracies are found promising that proves the effectiveness of the prefrontal fNIRS signal to be effective in movement-related brain functionality analysis.	[Rahman, Md.

Methods based on Riemannian geometry have proven themselves to be good models for decoding in brain-computer interfacing (BCI). However, these methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and are not possible to deploy in high-density online BCI systems. In addition, the lack of interpretability of Riemannian methods leaves open the possibility that artifacts drive classification performance, which is problematic in the areas where artifactual control is crucial, e.g. neurofeedback and BCIs in patient populations. Approach. We rigorously proved the exact equivalence between any linear function on the tangent space and corresponding derived spatial filters. Upon which, we further proposed a set of dimension reduction solutions for Riemannian methods without intensive optimization steps. The proposed pipelines are validated against classic common spatial patterns and tangent space classification using an open-access BCI analysis framework, which contains over seven datasets and 200 subjects in total. At last, the robustness of our framework is verified via visualizing the corresponding spatial patterns. Main results. Proposed spatial filtering methods possess competitive, sometimes even slightly better, performances comparing to classic tangent space classification while reducing the time cost up to 97% in the testing stage. Importantly, the performances of proposed spatial filtering methods converge with using only four to six filter components regardless of the number of channels which is also cross validated by the visualized spatial patterns. These results reveal the possibility of underlying neuronal sources within each recording session. Significance. Our work promotes the theoretical understanding about Riemannian geometry based BCI classification and allows for more efficient classification as well as the removal of artifact sources from classifiers built on Riemannian methods.

This study modifies the conventional CSP algorithm to improve the multi-class MI classification accuracy and ensure the computation process is efficient. The EEG MI data is gathered from the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Competition IV. At first, a bandpass filter and a time-frequency analysis are performed for each experiment trial. Then, the optimal EEG signals for every experiment trials are selected based on the signal energy for CSP feature extraction. In the end, the extracted features are classified by three classifiers, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), naive Bayes (NVB), and support vector machine (SVM), in parallel for classification accuracy comparison. The experiment results show the proposed algorithm average computation time is 37.22% less than the FBCSP (1st winner in the BCI Competition IV) and 4.98% longer than the conventional CSP method. For the classification rate, the proposed algorithm kappa value achieved 2nd highest compared with the top 3 winners in BCI Competition IV.

These systems seek online adaptation of stimulation parameters in closed-loop as a function of neural markers, aiming at improving treatment's efficacy and reducing side effects. Typically, the identification of PD neural markers is based on group-level studies. Due to the heterogeneity of symptoms across patients, however, such group-level neural markers, like the beta band power of the subthalamic nucleus, are not present in every patient or not informative about every patient's motor state. Instead, individual neural markers may be preferable for providing a personalized solution for the adaptation of stimulation parameters. Fortunately, data-driven bottom-up approaches based on machine learning may be utilized. These approaches have been developed and applied successfully in the field of brain-computer interfaces with the goal of providing individuals with means of communication and control. In our contribution, we present results obtained with a novel supervised data-driven identification of neural markers of hand motor performance based on a supervised machine learning model. Data of 16 experimental sessions obtained from seven PD patients undergoing DBS therapy show that the supervised patient-specific neural markers provide improved decoding accuracy of hand motor performance, compared to group-level neural markers reported in the literature. We observed that the individual markers are sensitive to DBS therapy and thus, may represent controllable variables in an adaptive DBS system.

In the signal recognition of electroencephalogram (EEG) of epilepsy, traditional machine learning and statistical methods require manual feature labeling engineering in order to show excellent results on a single data set. And the artificially selected features may carry a bias, and cannot guarantee the validity and expansibility in real-world data. In practical applications, deep learning methods can release people from feature engineering to a certain extent. As long as the focus is on the expansion of data quality and quantity, the algorithm model can learn automatically to get better improvements. In addition, the deep learning method can also extract many features that are difficult for humans to perceive, thereby making the algorithm more robust. Based on the design idea of ResNeXt deep neural network, this paper designs a Time-ResNeXt network structure suitable for time series EEG epilepsy detection to identify EEG signals. The accuracy rate of Time-ResNeXt in the detection of EEG epilepsy can reach 91.50%. The Time-ResNeXt network structure produces extremely advanced performance on the benchmark dataset (Berne-Barcelona dataset) and has great potential for improving clinical practice.

J	Doma, V; Pirouz, M				Doma, Vikrant; Pirouz, Matin			A comparative analysis of machine learning methods for emotion recognition using EEG and peripheral physiological signals	JOURNAL OF BIG DATA			English	Article						Emotion recognition; Multi-channel EEG; Machine learning; Classification	BRAIN	Emotion recognition using brain signals has the potential to change the way we identify and treat some health conditions. Difficulties and limitations may arise in general emotion recognition software due to the restricted number of facial expression triggers, dissembling of emotions, or among people with alexithymia. Such triggers are identified by studying the continuous brainwaves generated by human brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the brain give us a more diverse insight on emotional states that one may not be able to express. Brainwave EEG signals can reflect the changes in electrical potential resulting from communications networks between neurons. This research involves analyzing the epoch data from EEG sensor channels and performing comparative analysis of multiple machine learning techniques [namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees each of these models] were tested with and without principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Grid search was also utilized for hyper-parameter tuning for each of the tested machine learning models over Spark cluster for lowered execution time. The DEAP Dataset was used in this study, which is a multimodal dataset for the analysis of human affective states. The predictions were based on the labels given by the participants for each of the 40 1-min long excerpts of music. music. Participants rated each video in terms of the level of arousal, valence, like/dislike, dominance and familiarity. The binary class classifiers were trained on the time segmented, 15 s intervals of epoch data, individually for each of the 4 classes. PCA with SVM performed the best and produced an F1-score of 84.73% with 98.01% recall in the 30th to 45th interval of segmentation. For each of the time segments and "a binary training class" a different classification model converges to a better accuracy and recall than others. The results prove that different classification models must be used to identify different emotional states.

Ramasubba			Detection of Motor Imagery Movements in EEG-based BCI	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain computer interface; electroencephalogram; Hilbert transform; second order difference plot; support vector machine	FEATURES	Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication device that helps motor disabled patients to interact with the surrounding through their brain signals. But, it has low performance due to huge variations of brain patterns among the patients. The main reason behind is that the difference in spatial and temporal distribution of the brain signals. In order to boost the efficiency of the system, this paper combined features obtained from the Hilbert transform (HT) and second order difference plot (SODP). The proposed technique decomposed raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals into multiple sub-bands with distinct frequency bands. The event-related patterns (ERPs) and MI features for each band were extracted through the HT and SODP. The obtained ERPs and MI features were fed into a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) for decoding brain activities. Two different benchmark datasets (BCI competition-III and IV) were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the mean classification accuracy (%CA) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (K) obtained from the proposed technique are higher than state-of-the-art techniques.

EEG-based classification of natural sounds reveals specialized responses to speech and music	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Natural sounds; Biophysical model; Classification analysis; Speech; Music	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; DISTINCT CORTICAL PATHWAYS; ACOUSTIC FEATURES; NEURAL RESPONSES; REPRESENTATIONS; STATISTICS; AMPLITUDE; PATTERNS; LANGUAGE	Humans can easily distinguish many sounds in the environment, but speech and music are uniquely important. Previous studies, mostly using fMRI, have identified separate regions of the brain that respond selectively for speech and music. Yet there is little evidence that brain responses are larger and more temporally precise for human-specific sounds like speech and music compared to other types of sounds, as has been found for responses to species-specific sounds in other animals. We recorded EEG as healthy, adult subjects listened to various types of two-second-long natural sounds. By classifying each sound based on the EEG response, we found that speech, music, and impact sounds were classified better than other natural sounds. But unlike impact sounds, the classification accuracy for speech and music dropped for synthesized sounds that have identical frequency and modulation statistics based on a subcortical model, indicating a selectivity for higher-order features in these sounds. Lastly, the patterns in average power and phase consistency of the two-second EEG responses to each sound replicated the patterns of speech and music selectivity observed with classification accuracy. Together with the classification results, this suggests that the brain produces temporally individualized responses to speech and music sounds that are stronger than the responses to other natural sounds. In addition to highlighting the importance of speech and music for the human brain, the techniques used here could be a cost-effective, temporally precise, and efficient way to study the human brain's selectivity for speech and music in other populations.

Emotion is commonly associated with logical decision making, perception, human interaction, and to a certain extent, human intelligence itself. With the growing interest of the research community towards establishing some meaningful "emotional" interactions between humans and computers, the need for reliable and deployable solutions for the identification of human emotional states is required. Recent developments in using electroencephalography (EEG) for emotion recognition have garnered strong interest from the research community as the latest developments in consumer-grade wearable EEG solutions can provide a cheap, portable, and simple solution for identifying emotions. Since the last comprehensive review was conducted back from the years 2009 to 2016, this paper will update on the current progress of emotion recognition using EEG signals from 2016 to 2019. The focus on this state-of-the-art review focuses on the elements of emotion stimuli type and presentation approach, study size, EEG hardware, machine learning classifiers, and classification approach. From this state-of-the-art review, we suggest several future research opportunities including proposing a different approach in presenting the stimuli in the form of virtual reality (VR). To this end, an additional section devoted specifically to reviewing only VR studies within this research domain is presented as the motivation for this proposed new approach using VR as the stimuli presentation device. This review paper is intended to be useful for the research community working on emotion recognition using EEG signals as well as for those who are venturing into this field of research.

False alarms reduction in non-convulsive status epilepticus detection via continuous EEG analysis	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						EEG analysis; seizure detection; false alarms; non-convulsive status epilepticus	SEIZURE DETECTION; VISIBILITY GRAPHS; CARE; PATTERNS	Objective: Frequent false alarms from computer-assisted monitoring systems may harm the safety of patients with non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). In this study, we aimed at reducing false alarms in the NCSE detection based on preventing from three common errors: over-interpretation of abnormal background activity, dense short ictal discharges and continuous interictal discharges as ictal discharges.Approach: We analyzed 10 participants' hospital-archived 127-hour electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with 310 ictal discharges. To reduce the false alarms caused by abnormal background activity, we used morphological features extracted by visibility graph methods in addition to time-frequency features. To reduce the false alarms caused by over-interpreting short ictal discharges and interictal discharges, we created two synthetic classes-'Suspected Non-ictal' and 'Suspected Ictal'-based on the misclassified categories and constructed a synthetic 4-class dataset combining the standard two classes-'Non-ictal' and 'Ictal'-to train a 4-class classifier. Precision-recall curves were used to compare our proposed 4-class classification model and the standard 2-class classification model with or without the morphological features in the leave-one-out cross validation stage. The sensitivity and precision were primarily used as performance metrics for the detection of a seizure event.Main results: The 4-class classification model improved the performance of the standard 2-class model, in particular increasing the precision by 15% at an 80% sensitivity level when only time-frequency features were used. Using the morphological features, the 4-class classification model achieved the best performances: a sensitivity of 93% +/- 12% and a precision of 55% +/- 30% in the group level. 100% accuracy was reached in a participant's 4.3-hour recording with 5 ictal discharges.Significance: False alarms in the NCSE detection were remarkably reduced using the morphological features and the proposed 4-class classification model.

J	Krishnan, PT; Raj, ANJ; Balasubramanian, P; Chen, YZ				Krishnan, Palani Thanaraj; Raj, Alex Noel Joseph; Balasubramanian, Parvathavarthini; Chen, Yuanzhu			Schizophrenia detection using Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition and entropy measures from multichannel EEG signal	BIOCYBERNETICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; Multivariate Empirical Mode; Decomposition; Intrinsic Mode Function; Entropy features; Multivariate signal; Signal classification; Machine Learning classifier	SEIZURE; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLEXITY; EPILEPSY; SYSTEM	Multivariate analysis of the EEG signal for the detection of Schizophrenia condition is proposed here. Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) is used to decompose the EEG signal into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) signal. The randomness measure of the IMF signal is determined by computing the entropy of the signal. Five entropy measures such as Approximate entropy, Sample entropy, Permutation entropy, Spectral entropy, and Singular Value Decomposition entropy are measured from the IMF signal. These entropy measures showed a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the healthy controls (HC) and Schizophrenia (SZ) subjects. Many state-of-the-art (SoA) machine learning classifiers are trained on the feature matrix obtained from entropy values of the IMF signal, amongst them Support Vector Machine based on Radial Basis Function (SVM-RBF) provided the highest accuracy and F1-score of 93% for the 95 features. The area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9831 was obtained using this classifier. These performance metrics suggests that computation of randomness measure such as entropy in the multivariate IMF domain provided better discriminating power in detection of Schizophrenia condition from the multichannel EEG signal.

To ensure successful classification performance to BCI systems, researchers endeavor to extract appropriate features. However, these challenges are based on the conventional method. In this study, EEG signals related to MI tasks are classified using the convolutional neural network (CNN), which does not need a separate feature extraction. EEG records, which are generally evaluated as one-dimensional in machine learning problems, were taken into consideration as the image representation by using a novel method. The datasets were taken from a healthy subject. The subject was asked to move a cursor up and down on a computer screen, while his cortical potentials were taken. The EEG signals recorded over the 3.5-second time interval were evaluated for both the whole time and sub time intervals. Thus, the most effective time interval that has distinguishing features for EEG recordings related to different cursor movements was tried to be determined as well. As a result, it has been shown that the proposed model based on deep learning approach can successfully classify EEG signals related to cursor movements.

Absence seizures are usually associated with generalized spike-and wave on EEG. However, we present the case of a 10-year-old girl with Down syndrome and developmental delays who presented with atypical absence seizure associated with an unusual electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern of polyspike ictal-onset. Recognition of this ictal pattern in the pediatric population, as previously reported in adult populations, is important as it can have therapeutic and prognostic implications. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Although there exist a few interesting research works on the impact of video games over the child and adult group, most of them are only able to throw light on psychological aspects associated with the said cognitive task. The real-time detection of emotional states of the player while playing video game is still an unexplored area of research. The present work feels the void by proposing a novel scheme of detecting the emotional changes of human subject from their electroencephalographic (EEG) signal acquired during their engagement in playing video games. The problem is formulated in the settings of pattern classification, which involves four main steps: Data collection, pre-processing and artifact removal, feature extraction and classification. The novelty of the work lies in extracting the emotional content with a high recognition rate from the acquired EEG response using a deep learning algorithm. The primary contribution of the paper lies in efficient usage of a novel phase-sensitive Common Spatial Pattern algorithm for feature extraction and design of an attention-based Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network for classifying the emotional states of a video-game player into five classes: happiness, sadness, surprise, anger and neutral. Moreover, the scarcity of labeled data in EEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) tasks is a serious issue while understanding the performance capabilities of the data-driven deep-learning models. Therefore, the present work also makes an attempt to handle the scarcity in the dimension of the extracted feature using a novel feature augmentation algorithm before feeding the feature-vector to the proposed Bi-LSTM network. Experiments undertaken yield productive and conclusive results that validate the efficacy of the proposed framework with the accuracy rate of 88.71%. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In real life, human emotions are complex and changeable, so research into emotion recognition is of great significance in real life applications. Recently, many deep learning and machine learning methods have been widely applied in emotion recognition based on EEG signals. However, the traditional machine learning method has a major disadvantage in that the feature extraction process is usually cumbersome, which relies heavily on human experts. Then, end-to-end deep learning methods emerged as an effective method to address this disadvantage with the help of raw signal features and time-frequency spectrums. Here, we investigated the application of several deep learning models to the research field of EEG-based emotion recognition, including deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and a hybrid model of CNN and LSTM (CNN-LSTM). The experiments were carried on the well-known DEAP dataset. Experimental results show that the CNN and CNN-LSTM models had high classification performance in EEG-based emotion recognition, and their accurate extraction rate of RAW data reached 90.12 and 94.17%, respectively. The performance of the DNN model was not as accurate as other models, but the training speed was fast. The LSTM model was not as stable as the CNN and CNN-LSTM models. Moreover, with the same number of parameters, the training speed of the LSTM was much slower and it was difficult to achieve convergence. Additional parameter comparison experiments with other models, including epoch, learning rate, and dropout probability, were also conducted in the paper. Comparison results prove that the DNN model converged to optimal with fewer epochs and a higher learning rate. In contrast, the CNN model needed more epochs to learn. As for dropout probability, reducing the parameters by similar to 50% each time was appropriate.

However, the interaction among different conceptual representations remains unclear. To better understand the dynamics of how the brain extracts meaning from sensory stimuli, we conducted a human high-density electroencephalography (EEG) study in which we first trained participants to associate pseudowords with various animal and tool concepts. After training, multivariate pattern classification of EEG signals in sensor and source space revealed the representation of both animal and tool concepts in the left ATL and tool concepts within the left IPL within 250 ms. Finally, we used Granger Causality analyses to show that orthography-selective sensors directly modulated activity in the parietal-tool selective cluster. Together, our results provide evidence for distinct but parallel "perceptual-to-conceptual" feedforward hierarchies in the brain.

Automatic seizure detection has proved to be a challenging task, for both long terms monitoring as well as epilepsy diagnosis. In this work, the proposed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based singular value decomposition fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classifier (SVD-FkNN) technique, is one of the most effective methods in supervised learning, which provides good accuracy with fast learning speed in comparison to several other conventional techniques. In this work, both feature extraction and classification of EEG signals have been done for epilepsy detection of the human brain using the Bonn University dataset. The proposed method is based on the multi-scale eigenspace analysis of the matrices, generated from the sub-band signals of all EEG channels using DWT by SVD at a substantial scale and are classified using extracted singular value features and FkNN classifier with different 'k' values to obtain better accuracy. The proposed DWT based SVD-FkNN technique has been applied for the first time on the EEG signal for epilepsy detection (using five-class classifications). The experimental results of the proposed method give an overall accuracy of 100% for two and three class classification and 93.33% (p < 0.001) for five class classification.

However, the overall performance is often severely affected by subject's mental states. In this study, a method based on common feature analysis (CFA) was proposed for MI electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns recognition, which can not only improve the recognition accuracy but also help to find reliable and interpretable features associated with specific MI patterns. Evaluation using several open competition datasets justifies that the common features could more accurately identify MI characteristics and hence substantially benefit MI EEG patterns recognition.

To fully utilize the features on multiple dimensions of EEG signals, we propose a parallel sequence-channel projection convolutional neural network, including temporal stream sub-network, spatial stream sub-network, and fusion classification block. Temporal stream extracts temporal continuity via sequence-projection layer while spatial stream captures spatial correlation via channel-projection layer. Both sequence-projection and channel-projection adopt length-synchronized convolutional kernel to decode whole time and space information. The size of length-synchronized convolutional kernel is equal to the length of transmitted EEG sequence. The fusion classification block combines the extracted temporal and spatial features into a joint spatial-temporal feature vector for emotion prediction. In addition, we present a baseline noise filtering module to amplify input signals and a random channels exchange strategy to enrich the baseline-removed emotional signals. Experimental evaluation on DEAP dataset reveals that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art classification performance for the binary classification task. The recognition accuracies reach to 96.16% and 95.89% for valence and arousal. The proposed method can improve 3% to 6% than other latest advanced works.

J	Sosnik, R; Ben Zur, O				Sosnik, Ronen; Ben Zur, Omer			Reconstruction of hand, elbow and shoulder actual and imagined trajectories in 3D space using EEG slow cortical potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); imagined 3D arm movements; motion trajectory prediction (MTP); multiple linear regression (mLR); electroencephalography (EEG); slow cortical potentials (SCPs)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY; MOVEMENTS; ARM; CORTEX; REACH; BCI	Objective. The ability to decode kinematics of imagined movement from neural activity is essential for the development of prosthetic devices that can aid motor-disabled persons. To date, non-invasive recording methods, including electroencephalogram (EEG) were used to decode actual and imagined hand trajectory to control neuromotor prostheses, commonly by applying multi-dimensional linear regression (mLR) models to adjust the two temporal signals-neural signal and limb kinematics. It is still debated, however, whether the EEG signal, in general, and slow cortical potentials (SCPs), in specific, hold motor neural correlates. Moreover, it has not yet been tested whether the trajectory of proximal arm joints, i.e. shoulder, can also be reconstructed and if decoding performance is dependent on movement speed and/or position variance. Approach. We predicted hand, elbow and shoulder trajectories in 3D space in time series of both movement types (actual and imagined) of seven subjects using an mLR model, commonly applied for motion trajectory prediction (MTP) and used source localization to detect and compare between brain areas activated during actual and imagined movements for each arm joint. Main results. For all arm joints and movement types, SCPs contributed the most to trajectory reconstruction, and decoding accuracy peaked using neural signals preceding kinematics by 120-210 ms. The average (across subjects) Pearson's correlation coefficient between predicted and actual trajectories ranged 0.24-0.49, 0.41-0.48 and 0.18-0.40 for the hand, elbow and shoulder, respectively, and was significantly higher than chance level (p < 0.01) for all subjects. For the imagined movements, reconstruction accuracy ranged between 0.09-0.23, 0.20-0.27 and 0.11-0.18 for the hand, elbow and shoulder, respectively, and was significantly higher than chance level (p < 0.05) for all or some of the arm joints. The model performance was positively correlated with movement speed and negatively correlated with position variance. Source localization suggested that the neural circuits engaged in motor imagery are more diffuse and bilateral; motor imagery was, when compared to movement execution, more associated with recruiting premotor regions and a large area of the left parietal cortex. Significance. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting 3D imagined trajectories of all arm joints from scalp EEG and imply the existence of movement related neural correlates in slow cortical potentials.

Random-dot stereogram (RDS) is often used to detect stereoacuity and perform research on visual cognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the commonly adopted visual cognition techniques due to its noninvasive collection. New method: In this study, a methodology named WPT-BED based on wavelet packet transform (WPT) and bispectral eigenvalues of differential signals (BED) is proposed, which can classify the three-pattern EEG signals evoked by dynamic RDS (DRDS). Specifically, the signals are decomposed into different frequency bands by WPT. The appropriate sub-bands are selected for reconstruction. Finally, the optimized bispectrum features are extracted for classification to achieve higher accuracy. Results: The classification performance of the proposed method in different periods of signal processing are investigated. The method WPT-BED has the highest classification accuracy 84.38%, and the average classification accuracy is 73.98%. The active channels with higher accuracy are focused on the visual pathway in the human cerebral cortex. Comparison with existing methods: Comparison with other methods for EEG signals classification is performed to identify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Conclusions: The proposed methodology can effectively distinguish the EEG signals evoked by DRDS. It demonstrates the feasibility of DRDS recognition based on EEG.

A BCI may use the magnetic, electrical, or metabolic activity of the brain. Electro-encephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique. It is popular for BCI research and is preferred due to its high temporal resolution, low cost of devices, convenience and movability. BCI based applications have massive potential in assistive devices, health care, and amusement industry. A regular BCI system comprises of these steps: signal acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. An EEG contains the impulsive electrical activity of the brain taken from electrodes placed on the scalp of the subject. The EEG signal is then processed to remove noise and enhance the signal for analysing further. Features are mined from the amplitude and frequency of the recorded analog signals which can be transformed into feature vectors, and given as input to a classifier. Since EEG is non-stationary in nature, vulnerable to artifacts and has high variability, we need algorithms that efficiently extract relevant features and classify the signals accurately. This study reviews some recent applications of BCI and the feature extraction techniques used by them. Machine learning algorithms typically used in EEG-based BCI applications are also studied.

J	Grossi, E; Valbusa, G; Buscema, M				Grossi, Enzo; Valbusa, Giovanni; Buscema, Massimo			Detection of an Autism EEG Signature From Only Two EEG Channels Through Features Extraction and Advanced Machine Learning Analysis	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG signature; TWIST system; autism; early detection; newborns		Background and Objective In 2 previous studies, we have shown the ability of special machine learning systems applied to standard EEG data in distinguishing children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from non-ASD children with an overall accuracy rate of 100% and 98.4%, respectively. Since the equipment routinely available in neonatology units employ few derivations, we were curious to check if just 2 derivations were enough to allow good performance in the same cases of the above-mentioned studies. Methods A continuous segment of artifact-free EEG data lasting 1 minute in ASCCI format from C3 and C4 EEG channels present in 2 previous studies, was used for features extraction and subsequent analyses with advanced machine learning systems. A features extraction software package (Python tsfresh) applied to time-series raw data derived 1588 quantitative features. A special hybrid system called TWIST (Training with Input Selection and Testing), coupling an evolutionary algorithm named Gen-D and a backpropagation neural network, was used to subdivide the data set into training and testing sets as well as to select features yielding the maximum amount of information after a first variable selection performed with linear correlation index threshold. Results After this intelligent preprocessing, 12 features were extracted from C3-C4 time-series of study 1 and 36 C3-C4 time-series of study 2 representing the EEG signature. Acting on these features the overall accuracy predictive capability of the best artificial neural network acting as a classifier in deciphering autistic cases from typicals (study 1) and other neuropsychiatric disorders (study 2) resulted in 100 % for study 1 and 94.95 % for study 2. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that also a minor part of EEG contains precious information useful to detect autism if treated with advanced computational algorithms. This could allow in the future to use standard EEG from newborns to check if the ASD signature is already present at birth.

J	Elsayed, M; Sim, KS; Tan, SC				Elsayed, Mahmoud; Sim, Kok Swee; Tan, Shing Chiang			A Novel Approach to Objectively Quantify the Subjective Perception of Pain Through Electroencephalogram Signal Analysis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Pain; Electroencephalography; Signal processing; Containers; Machine learning; Correlation; Reliability; Physical pain; alpha frequency band; signal processing; artificial neural networks	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; SENSITIVITY; MATRIX	Pain is a complex subjective unpleasant experience that can potentially cause tissue damage. In clinical practice, the main method used for assessing pain is self-report; however, it is not possibly adopted in a huge number of vulnerable populations or by non-communicative patients such as those with disorders of speech and consciousness. Thus, the availability of an objective measure of the subjective pain's perception that complements the self-report pain assessments is a great significant demand in several clinical applications. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel approach to objectively quantify the subjective perception of pain. We integrated signal processing techniques and machine learning principles to learn brain signals associated with pain and classify them into one of four pain intensities (no pain, low, moderate, and high). We found that the signal processing revealed a direct correlation between Alpha frequency band power and the pain intensity, and the classifier could achieve an accuracy of 94.83%. This study provides a clue for the betterment of the collective scientific understanding of the brain's activities inflicted by the physical pain and helps in building a reliable automated prediction of pain.

In this study, we have investigated whether changes in odor stimuli evaluation across repeated stimuli presentation can be attributed to changes in brain perception of the stimuli. Epoch intervals representing olfactory sensory perception were extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) signals using minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)-based single trial event related potential (ERP) approach to understand the evoked response to high pleasantness and low pleasantness stimuli. We found statistically significant changes in self reported stimuli evaluation between initial and final trials ( p < 0.05) for both stimuli categories. However, the changes in ERP amplitude were found to be statistically significant only for the high pleasantness stimuli. This implies that olfactory stimuli of higher hedonic value recruit high-order cognitive processing that may be responsible for initial increased ERP response, as well as for rapid subsequent adaptation in processing the stimuli.

Here we set out to systematically correlate early EEG and MRI findings. Methods: 89 adult patients from a prospective register who underwent at least one EEG and one MRI in the acute phase after CA were included. The EEGs were characterized using pre-existent standardized categories (highly malignant, malignant, benign). For MRIs, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was computed in pre-defined regions. We then introduced a novel classification based on the topography of ADC reduction (MR-lesion pattern (MLP) 1: no lesion; MLP 2: purely cortical lesions; MLP 3: involvement of the basal ganglia; MLP 4 involvement of other deep grey matter regions). Results: EEG background reactivity and EEG background continuity were strongly associated with a lower MLP value (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003 respectively). The EEG categories highly malignant, malignant and benign were strongly correlated with the MLP values (rho = 0.46, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The MRI lesions are highly correlated with the EEG pattern. Our results suggest that performing MRI in comatose patients after CA with either highly malignant or with a benign EEG pattern is unlikely to yield additional useful information for prognostication, and should therefore be performed in priority in patients with intermediate EEG patterns ("malignant pattern").

This paper introduces a machine learning model based on oblique decision trees to enable resource-efficient classification on a neural implant. By integrating model compression with probabilistic routing and implementing cost-aware learning, our proposed model could significantly reduce the memory and hardware cost compared to state-of-the-art models, while maintaining the classification accuracy. We trained the resource-efficient oblique tree with power-efficient regularization (ResOT-PE) on three neural classification tasks to evaluate the performance, memory, and hardware requirements. On seizure detection task, we were able to reduce the model size by 3.4x and the feature extraction cost by 14.6x compared to the ensemble of boosted trees, using the intracranial EEG from 10 epilepsy patients. In a second experiment, we tested the ResOT-PE model on tremor detection for Parkinson's disease, using the local field potentials from 12 patients implanted with a deep-brain stimulation (DBS) device. We achieved a comparable classification performance as the state-of-the-art boosted tree ensemble, while reducing the model size and feature extraction cost by 10.6x and 6.8x, respectively. We also tested on a 6-class finger movement detection task using ECoG recordings from 9 subjects, reducing the model size by 17.6x and feature computation cost by 5.1x. The proposed model can enable a low-power and memory-efficient implementation of classifiers for real-time neurological disease detection and motor decoding.

A Privacy-Preserving Generative Adversarial Network Method for Securing EEG Brain Signals	2020 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) held as part of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (IEEE WCCI)	JUL 19-24, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc				Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently shown high success in applications such as image and time-series classification. However, those applications are vulnerable to complex hacking scenarios, for example, inference and data poisoning attacks, which would alter or infer sensitive information about systems and users. Protecting Electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals against illegal disclosure has a great interest these days. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving GAN method to generate and classify EEG data effectively. Generating EEG data offers a range of capabilities, including sharing experimental data without infringing user privacy, improving machine learning models for brain-computer interface tasks and restore corrupted data. The proposed GAN model is trained under a differential privacy model to enhance the data privacy level by limiting queries of data from artificial trials that could identify the real participants from their EEG signals. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a motor imagery classification task, where real EEG data are augmented with artificially generated samples for training machine learning classifiers. The evaluation was performed on a benchmark EEG data set for nine subjects. The experimental outcomes revealed that the non-private version of the proposed approach could produce high-quality data that significantly improve the motor imagery classification performance. The private version showed lower but comparable performance to the standard models trained on real data only.

EEG Signal Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks on Combined Spatial and Temporal Dimensions for BCI Systems	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				EEG signal classification is an important task to build an accurate Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system. Many machine learning and deep learning approaches have been used to classify EEG signals. Besides, many studies have involved the time and frequency domain features to classify EEG signals. On the other hand, a very limited number of studies combine the spatial and temporal dimensions of the EEG signal. Brain dynamics are very complex across different mental tasks, thus it is difficult to design efficient algorithms with features based on prior knowledge. Therefore, in this study, we utilized the 2D AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn EEG features across different mental tasks without prior knowledge. First, this study adds spatial and temporal dimensions of EEG signals to a 2D EEG topographic map. Second, topographic maps at different time indices were cascaded to populate a 2D image for a given time window. Finally, the topographic maps enabled the AlexNet to learn features from the spatial and temporal dimensions of the brain signals. The classification performance was obtained by the proposed method on a multiclass dataset from BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. The proposed system obtained an average classification accuracy of 81.09%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 4% for the same dataset. The results showed that converting the EEG classification problem from a (1D) time series to a (2D) image classification problem improves the classification accuracy for BCI systems. Also, our EEG topographic maps enabled CNN to learn subtle features from spatial and temporal dimensions, which better represent mental tasks than individual time or frequency domain features.

In two stages prediction, 27 conditions and 6 functions are used to decide how to predict the current data from previous data. Then, voting prediction finds optimal function according to 27 conditions for best function to produce best Error (the difference of predicted data and current data). Moreover, a tri-entropy coding technique is developed based on normal distribution. The two-stage Huffman coding and Golomb-Rice coding was used to generate the binary code of Error value. In CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, the novel EEG compression algorithm achieves average compression rate to 2.37. The proposed hardware-oriented algorithm is suitable for VLSI implementation due to its low complexity.

The conditional entropy of ordinal patterns (CEOP) is known to be fast and easy to implement, which can effectively measure the irregularity of the physiological signals. The present work aims to apply the CEOP to analyze the complexity characteristics of the EEG signals and recognize the epilepsy EEG signals. We discuss the parameter selection and the performance analysis of the CEOP based on the neural mass model. The CEOP is applied to the real EEG database of Bonn epilepsy for identification. The results show that the CEOP is an excellent metrics for the analysis and recognition of epileptic EEG signals. The differences of the CEOP in normal and epileptic brain states suggest that the CEOP could be a judgment tool for the diagnosis of the epileptic seizure.

Correct seizure prediction can significantly improve the standard of living for the majority of epileptic patients, as the unpredictability of seizures is a major concern for them. Today, the development of algorithms, particularly in the field of machine learning, enables reliable and accurate seizure prediction using desktop computers. However, despite extensive research effort being devoted to developing seizure detection integrated circuits (ICs), dedicated seizure prediction ICs have not been developed yet. We believe that interdisciplinary study of system architecture, analog and digital ICs, and machine learning algorithms can promote the translation of scientific theory to a more realistic intelligent, integrated, and low-power system that can truly improve the standard of living for epileptic patients. This review explores topics ranging from signal acquisition analog circuits to classification algorithms and dedicated digital signal processing circuits for detection and prediction purposes, to provide a comprehensive and useful guideline for the construction, implementation and optimization of wearable and integrated smart seizure prediction systems.

Differences in speech intelligibility in noise cannot be fully explained by the hearing ability which suggests the involvement of additional cognitive factors. A better understanding of the temporal fluctuations in the ability to pay selective auditory attention to a desired speech stream may help in explaining these variabilities. In order to better understand the temporal dynamics of selective auditory attention, we developed an online auditory attention decoding (AAD) processing pipeline based on speech envelope tracking in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants had to attend to one audiobook story while a second one had to be ignored. Online AAD was applied to track the attention toward the target speech signal. Individual temporal attention profiles were computed by combining an established AAD method with an adaptive staircase procedure. The individual decoding performance over time was analyzed and linked to behavioral performance as well as subjective ratings of listening effort, motivation, and fatigue. The grand average attended speaker decoding profile derived in the online experiment indicated performance above chance level. Parameters describing the individual AAD performance in each testing block indicated significant differences in decoding performance over time to be closely related to the behavioral performance in the selective listening task. Further, an exploratory analysis indicated that subjects with poor decoding performance reported higher listening effort and fatigue compared to good performers. Taken together our results show that online EEG based AAD in a complex listening situation is feasible. Adaptive attended speaker decoding profiles over time could be used as an objective measure of behavioral performance and listening effort. The developed online processing pipeline could also serve as a basis for future EEG based near real-time auditory neurofeedback systems.

In the current study, we investigated whether EEG-based correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified and decoded using mobile EEG systems, namely the water-based EEG-Versatile(TM)system and the dry-electrodes EEG-Hero(TM)headset. In addition, we also analyzed gel-based recordings obtained in a laboratory environment (g.USBamp/g.Ladybird, gold standard), which followed the same experimental parameters. For each recording system, 15 study participants performed 80 self-initiated reach-and-grasp actions toward a glass (palmar grasp) and a spoon (lateral grasp). Our results confirmed that EEG-based correlates of reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified using these mobile systems. In a single-trial multiclass-based decoding approach, which incorporated both movement conditions and rest, we could show that the low frequency time domain (LFTD) correlates were also decodable. Grand average peak accuracy calculated on unseen test data yielded for the water-based electrode system 62.3% (9.2% STD), whereas for the dry-electrodes headset reached 56.4% (8% STD). For the gel-based electrode system 61.3% (8.6% STD) could be achieved. To foster and promote further investigations in the field of EEG-based movement decoding, as well as to allow the interested community to make their own conclusions, we provide all datasets publicly available in the BNCI Horizon 2020 database ().

Metin			An improved feature extraction method using texture analysis with LBP for bearing fault diagnosis	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Texture analysis; Vibration signals; Local binary pattern	LOCAL BINARY PATTERNS; SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; EPILEPTIC EEG; BALL-BEARING; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM	Bearings are one of the most widespread components used for energy transformation in machines. Mechanical wear and faulty bearings reduce the efficiency of rotating machines and thus increase energy consumption. The feature extraction process is an essential part of fault diagnosis in bearings. In order to diagnose the fault caused by the bearing correctly, it is necessary to determine an effective feature extraction method that best describes the fault. In this study, a new approach based on texture analysis is proposed for diagnosing bearing vibration signals. Bearing vibration signals were first converted to gray scale images. It can be understood from the images that the signals of different bearing failures form different textures. Then, using these images, LBP (Local Binary Pattern) and texture features were obtained. Using these features, different machine learning models and bearing vibration signals are classified. Three different data sets were created to test the proposed approach. For the first data set, the signals composed of very close velocities were classified. 95.9% success rate was observed for the first data set. The second data set consists of faulty signals at different parts of the bearing (inner ring, outer ring and ball) measured in the same RPM. The type of fault has been determined, and a 100% success rate was obtained for this data set. The final data set is composed of the fault size dimensions (mm) of different ratios. With the proposed approach, a 100% success rate was obtained in the classification of these signals. As a result, it was observed that the obtained feature had promising results for three different data types and was more successful than the traditional methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The human brain is a complex structure, whose function can be evaluated with electroencephalogram (EEG). Automated driver fatigue detection utilizing EEG decreases the incidence probability of related traffic accidents. Therefore, devising an appropriate feature extraction technique and selecting a competent classification method can be considered as the crucial part of the effective driver fatigue detection. Therefore, in this study, an EEG-based intelligent system was devised for driver fatigue detection. The proposed framework includes a new feature generation network, which is implemented by using texture descriptors, for fatigue detection. The proposed scheme contains pre-processing, feature generation, informative features selection and classification with shallow classifiers phases. In the pre-processing, discrete cosine transform and fast Fourier transform are used together. Moreover, dynamic center based binary pattern and multi threshold ternary pattern are utilized together to create a new feature generation network. To improve the detection performance, we utilized discrete wavelet transform as a pooling method, in which the functional brain network-based feature describing the relationship between fatigue and brain network organization. In the feature selection phase, a hybrid three layered feature selection method is presented, and benchmark classifiers are used in the classification phase to demonstrate the strength of the proposed method. In the experiments, the proposed framework achieved 97.29% classification accuracy for fatigue detection using EEG signals. This result reveals that the proposed framework can be utilized effectively for driver fatigue detection.

Considering that taking a correct decision on various issues particularly in the field of diagnosing diseases, such as epilepsy, is of paramount importance, a functional approach is designed to extract the optimal features of EEG signals. The proposed method is comprised of two main steps: First, extraction and selection of features is performed based on a novel improved 1D-LBP model followed by data normalization through principal component analysis (PCA); as combining 1D-LBP neighboring models and PCA (1D-LBPc2p) method. The second step includes classification using two of the best ensemble classification algorithms, that is, random forest and rotation forest. A comparative evaluation is performed between the proposed methods and 13 distinct reported approaches including uniform and non-uniform 1D-LBP. The results are demonstrating that the combining method presented in our approaches has superiority along with efficiency by providing higher accuracy compared to the other models and classifiers. The proposed method in this paper can be considered as a new method for feature extraction and selection of other kinds of EEG signals and data sets.

Traditionally, features are extracted from time, frequency, or time-frequency domains for MI pattern recognition achieved by classifiers. However, the features from a single domain can only provide limited information useful for final classification, thus may lead to unsatisfactory performance. Also, the features from different domains may contain different and complementary information for MI pattern classification. Therefore, it is necessary to fuse them to enhance pattern classification capability. To this end, a two-level feature extraction approach based on sparse representation (SR) for MI EEG signals is proposed in this paper, which mainly consists of multi-domain feature extraction and sparse feature fusion. In the proposed method, multi-domain features, including Hjorth, the power spectrum estimation via maximum entropy, and time-frequency energy, are first extracted as the initial feature space. Then sparse representation is used to fuse extracted multi-domain features to obtain low-dimensional informative features with better discriminative ability. Finally, these transformed low-dimensional features are fed into a classifier to identify different MI patterns. The proposed method is evaluated using the public competition datasets (BCI2008), and achieved the average accuracy of over 79%. The results indicate that compared with existing methods and single domain-based feature extraction methods, the proposed method achieved better classification performance.

A BCI System Based on Motor Imagery for Assisting People with Motor Deficiencies in the Limbs	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); motor Imagery (MI); electroencephalography (EEG); wavelet packet decomposition (WPD); feature selection (FS)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; REHABILITATION; REORGANIZATION; RECOVERY; SIGNALS; PATTERN; STROKE; ATAXIA	Motor deficiencies constitute a significant problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Such people suffer from a debility in daily functioning, which may lead to decreased and incoherence in daily routines and deteriorate their quality of life (QoL). Thus, there is an essential need for assistive systems to help those people achieve their daily actions and enhance their overall QoL. This study proposes a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) system for assisting people with limb motor disabilities in performing their daily life activities by using their brain signals to control assistive devices. The extraction of useful features is vital for an efficient BCI system. Therefore, the proposed system consists of a hybrid feature set that feeds into three machine-learning (ML) classifiers to classify motor Imagery (MI) tasks. This hybrid feature selection (FS) system is practical, real-time, and an efficient BCI with low computation cost. We investigate different combinations of channels to select the combination that has the highest impact on performance. The results indicate that the highest achieved accuracies using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier are 93.46% and 86.0% for the BCI competition III-IVa dataset and the autocalibration and recurrent adaptation dataset, respectively. These datasets are used to test the performance of the proposed BCI. Also, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed BCI by comparing its performance with recent studies. We show that the proposed system is accurate and efficient. Future work can apply the proposed system to individuals with limb motor disabilities to assist them and test their capability to improve their QoL. Moreover, the forthcoming work can examine the system's performance in controlling assistive devices such as wheelchairs or artificial limbs.

The inter-subject and intra-subject variability was investigated under the inhibition of human response with a realistic environmental scenario. In present study, we used a battleground scenario where a sniper-scope picture was the background, a target picture was a go signal, and a nontarget picture was a stop signal. The task instructions were to respond on the target image and inhibit the response if a nontarget image appeared. This scenario produced a threatening situation and endorsed the evaluation of how subject's response inhibition manifests in a real situation. In this study, 32 channels of electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected from 20 participants during successful stop (response inhibition) and failed stop (response) trials. These EEG signals were used to predict two possible outcomes: successful stop or failed stop. The inter-subject variability (between-subjects) and intra-subject variability (within-subjects) affect the performance of participants in the classification system. The EEG signals of successful stop versus failed stop trials were classified using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (i.e., parametric) and K-nearest neighbor classifier (KNNC) and Parzen density-based (PARZEN) (i.e., nonparametric) under inter- and intra-subject variability. The EEG activities were found to increase during response inhibition in the frontal cortex (F3 and F4), presupplementary motor area (C3 and C4), parietal lobe (P3 and P4), and occipital (O1 and O2) lobe. Therefore, power spectral density (PSD) of EEG signals (1-50Hz) in F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, and O2 electrodes were measured in successful stop and failed stop trials. The PSD of the EEG signals was used as the feature input for the classifiers. Our proposed method shows an intra-subject classification accuracy of 97.61% for subject 15 with QDA classifier in C3 (left motor cortex) and an overall inter-subject classification accuracy of 71.66% +/- 9.81% with the KNNC classifier in F3 (left frontal lobe). These results display how inter-subject and intra-subject variability affects the performance of the classification system. These findings can be used effectively to improve the psychopathology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia, and suicidality.

In general, epileptic seizure detection using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a significant solution in preventing seizures through medication. Thus, the design of efficient machine learning-based seizure detection model is highly acclaimed by various academic and health professionals. In a motive to address the challenges posed by the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of noise, non-stationarity, and transient nature of EEG signals, this paper presents a novel Deep Learning model for epileptic seizure detection which hybridizes Adaptive Haar Wavelet-based Binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm and Deep Neural Network (AHW-BGOA-DNN). The experimental analysis was carried out using three benchmark EEG datasets obtained from the University of Bonn, the University of Bern and CHB-MIT EEG database which confirm the proposed technique to be reliable and accurate over the existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of stability analysis, classification accuracy, AUC-ROC Curve (Area Under Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristics), sensitivity, and specificity.

Integrating compositional pattern-producing networks and optimized convolution neural networks using deep learning techniques for detecting brain abnormalities	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Neural Networks; Independent component analysis; Electroencephalography (EEG); Discrete wavelet transform; Image slicing	TUMOR SEGMENTATION	In brain abnormality approach, accurate and reliable diagnosis is a critical component, because it provides potential abnormality in tissues as well as functional structures significantly to demarcate surgical plan. In the recent past, various diagnosing procedures have been carried out such as Double Density Discrete Wavelet Transform (DDDWT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, Convolutional Neural Networks etc., whereas treatment outcome and planning are the critical components. Build upon the successful deep learning approach, a novel brain abnormality diagnostic method has been developed by integrating Compositional Pattern Producing (CPP) and Optimized Convolutional Neural Networks (OCNN) in an unified framework. This hybrid approach includes Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with parallel factor and region of interest (ROI) for preprocessing, training CPP using image patches and fine tuning CPP-OCNN using image slices for segmentation as well as for extraction. This model could segment the images by slices than patches which are more accurate and less complex in segmentation with optimized kernel SVM classifier for abnormality detection. The system is evaluated based on MRI imaging datasets provided by CHB-MIT scalp EEG of micro bleeds dataset and efficiently validated with the help of the experimental results by minimizing the Root mean square and by improving the accuracy, smoothness, correlation, sensitivity and specificity using state of the art techniques.

There are three major paradigms that are commonly employed for BCI: motor-imagery (MI), event-related potential (ERP), and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). Three individual paradigms each have their own pros and cons in terms of the available number of classes, eye/mental fatigue, illiteracy rate, and etc. When designing BCI applications a whole range of factors need to be taken into account, such as the patient's psychological and physical condition, environmental limitations, necessary number of classes and required accuracy level, among others. Given the limitations of the individual paradigms, it may not always be possible to satisfy all requirements with a current unimodal paradigm. In this study, we propose the concept of a paradigm-independent BCI framework, in which all three paradigms are available at the same time and can be used interchangeably. To do this, task-related features from the individual paradigms were extracted and cross-validated. Average classification accuracy for three-paradigm decoding was 74.84%(+/- 8.49) across 49 subjects. By considering the three major BCI paradigms, namely MI, ERP and SSVEP and by creating a machine learning framework, which is able to successfully decode the paradigm from individual trials, we pave the way towards new and more complex applications, where the limitations of unimodal BCI paradigms are alleviated.

Phase-dependent amplification of working memory content and performance	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; GAMMA-POWER; ALPHA; REPRESENTATIONS; EXCITABILITY; MECHANISM; OBJECTS	Successful working memory performance has been related to oscillatory mechanisms operating in low-frequency ranges. Yet, their mechanistic interaction with the distributed neural activity patterns representing the content of the memorized information remains unclear. Here, we record EEG during a working memory retention interval, while a task-irrelevant, high-intensity visual impulse stimulus is presented to boost the read-out of distributed neural activity related to the content held in working memory. Decoding of this activity with a linear classifier reveals significant modulations of classification accuracy by oscillatory phase in the theta/alpha ranges at the moment of impulse presentation. Additionally, behavioral accuracy is highest at the phases showing maximized decoding accuracy. At those phases, behavioral accuracy is higher in trials with the impulse compared to no-impulse trials. This constitutes the first evidence in humans that working memory information is maximized within limited phase ranges, and that phase-selective, sensory impulse stimulation can improve working memory. Neuronal patterns during working memory show low-frequency oscillatory activity. Here, the authors demonstrate a rhythmic retention of working memory information in theta and alpha frequency ranges. Moreover, phase-locked amplification of the retained information improves working memory performance.

An electroencephalogram (EEG)-based algorithm has been developed to objectively assess CNS arousal and to disentangle these pathophysiologically heterogeneous forms of fatigue. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that fatigued patients with CNS hyperarousal score higher on depressive symptoms than those without this neurophysiological pattern. Methods: Subjects with fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory sum-score > 40) in the context of cancer, neuroinflammatory, or autoimmune diseases were drawn from the 60+ cohort of the Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases. CNS arousal was assessed by automatic EEG-vigilance stage classification using the Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig (VIGALL 2.1) based on 20 min EEG recordings at rest with eyes closed. Depression was assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR). Results: Sixty participants (33 female; median age: 67.5 years) were included in the analysis. As hypothesized, fatigued patients with CNS hyperarousal had higher IDS-SR scores than those without hyperarousal (F-1,F-58=18.34;p< 0.0001, eta(2)=0.240). Conclusion: hyperaroused fatigue in patients with chronic physical illness may be a sign of comorbid depression.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is commonly used to record the electrical functioning from the brain. These recorded EEG signals have non-stationary and non-linear characteristics. In this chapter, we have introduced a new methodology based on Fourier-Bessel series expansion (FBSE) and empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for the classification of epileptic seizure EEG signals. The scale-space representation based detection of boundaries has been adapted for the segmentation of the FBSE spectrum obtained with EEG signals, and the EWT is utilized to obtain narrow sub-band signals. Then, the Hilbert marginal spectrum (HMS) of these sub-band signals have been obtained with FBSE-EWT. Afterwards, the line length and entropy features have been computed from obtained HMSs corresponding to different oscillatory levels of the EEG signals. To reduce the feature space, the Kruskal-Wallis test based feature ranking is applied. The selected features after feature ranking are used in random forest (RF) classifier for classifying normal from healthy subjects and seizure from epileptic subjects using EEG signals. The classification is also validated with 10-fold cross-validation and 50% training-50% testing data techniques. In addition to these techniques, the 5-fold cross-validation and 40% training-60% testing data techniques have been also applied on the significant features corresponding to maximum classification accuracies obtained with 10-fold cross-validation and 50% training-50% testing data techniques in order to reduce computational complexity. The assessment of classification performance is also evaluated in terms of classification accuracy for different sample lengths of EEG signals. The obtained maximum classification accuracy in this proposed method is 100%, with 50% training-50% testing data technique. The proposed method may help the neurologists for the identification of healthy and epileptic subjects from EEG signals.

J	Su, J; Yang, ZY; Yan, W; Sun, WJ				Su, Jing; Yang, Zuyuan; Yan, Wei; Sun, Weijun			Electroencephalogram classification in motor-imagery brain-computer interface applications based on double-constraint nonnegative matrix factorization	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						brain-computer interface; motor imagery; electroencephalogram; double-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization	SPATIAL-PATTERNS; EEG; BCI	Objective: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are aimed at providing a new way of communication between the human brain and external devices. One of the major tasks associated with the BCI system is to improve classification performance of the motor imagery (MI) signal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used for the MI BCI system. The raw EEG signals are usually non-stationary time series with weak class properties, degrading the classification performance.Approach: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully applied to pattern extraction which provides meaningful data presentation. However, NMF is unsupervised and cannot make use of the label information. Based on the label information of MI EEG data, we propose a novel method, called double-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (DCNMF), to improve the classification performance of NMF on MI BCI. The proposed method constructs a couple of label matrices as the constraints on the NMF procedure to make the EEGs with the same class labels have the similar representation in the low-dimensional space, while the EEGs with different class labels have dissimilar representations as much as possible. Accordingly, the extracted features obtain obvious class properties, which are optimal to the classification of MI EEG.Main results: This study is conducted on the BCI competition III datasets (I and IVa). The proposed method helps to achieve a higher average accuracy across two datasets (79.00% for dataset I, 77.78% for dataset IVa); its performance is about 10% better than the existing studies in the literature.Significance: Our study provides a novel solution for MI BCI analysis from the perspective of label constraint; it provides convenience for semi-supervised learning of features and significantly improves the classification performance.

Including Measures of High Gamma Power Can Improve the Decoding of Natural Speech From EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; temporal response function (TRF); high gamma power; decoding attention; speech envelope	HIGH-FREQUENCY; BAND ACTIVITY; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; TEMPORAL ENVELOPE; ATTENDED SPEAKER; WORKING-MEMORY; COCKTAIL PARTY; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; TIME	The human auditory system is highly skilled at extracting and processing information from speech in both single-speaker and multi-speaker situations. A commonly studied speech feature is the amplitude envelope which can also be used to determine which speaker a listener is attending to in those multi-speaker situations. Non-invasive brain imaging (electro-/magnetoencephalography [EEG/MEG]) has shown that the phase of neural activity below 16 Hz tracks the dynamics of speech, whereas invasive brain imaging (electrocorticography [ECoG]) has shown that such processing is strongly reflected in the power of high frequency neural activity (around 70-150 Hz; known as high gamma). The first aim of this study was to determine if high gamma power scalp recorded EEG carries useful stimulus-related information, despite its reputation for having a poor signal to noise ratio. Specifically, linear regression was used to investigate speech envelope and attention decoding in low frequency EEG, high gamma power EEG, and in both EEG signals combined. The second aim was to assess whether the information reflected in high gamma power EEG may be complementary to that reflected in well-established low frequency EEG indices of speech processing. Exploratory analyses were also completed to examine how low frequency and high gamma power EEG may be sensitive to different features of the speech envelope. While low frequency speech tracking was evident for almost all subjects as expected, high gamma power also showed robust speech tracking in some subjects. This same pattern was true for attention decoding using a separate group of subjects who participated in a cocktail party attention experiment. For the subjects who showed speech tracking in high gamma power EEG, the spatiotemporal characteristics of that high gamma tracking differed from that of low-frequency EEG. Furthermore, combining the two neural measures led to improved measures of speech tracking for several subjects. Our results indicated that high gamma power EEG can carry useful information regarding speech processing and attentional selection in some subjects. Combining high gamma power and low frequency EEG can improve the mapping between natural speech and the resulting neural responses.

Such differential processing could be mediated by a swift network reconfiguration on the macroscopic level, but this remains a poorly understood process. To tackle this issue, we used a behavioral paradigm to introduce a shift of selective attention between the visual and auditory domains, and recorded scalp electroencephalographic signals from eight healthy participants. The changes in effective connectivity caused by the cross-modal attentional shift were delineated by analyzing spectral Granger Causality (GC), a metric of frequency-specific effective connectivity. Using data-driven methods of pattern-classification and feature-analysis, we found that a change in the alpha band (12 Hz-15 Hz) of GC is a stable feature across different individuals that can be used to decode the attentional shift. Specifically, auditory attention induces more pronounced information flow in the alpha band, especially from the parietal-occipital areas to the temporal-parietal areas, compared to the case of visual attention, reflecting a reconfiguration of interaction in the macroscopic brain network accompanying different processing. Our results support the role of alpha oscillation in organizing the information flow across spatially-separated brain areas and, thereby, mediating cross-modal selective attention.

Building on the successful application of data-driven methods in epileptic seizure detection, we aim to build a bridge between data and models in this paper. Methods: We first propose a novel model-driven seizure detection method based on dynamic features in epileptic EEGs, where the rationale for dynamic features in epileptic EEGs can be clarified in theory by characterizing the variation of parameters of the model. Then we apply the proposed D&F-model-driven method to the problem of early epileptic seizure detection, where the evolution of model parameters selected and optimized by the proposed method is measured and used to detect the starting point of the seizure. Results: Numerical results on two open EEG databases demonstrate that our proposed method does a good job of early epileptic seizure detection. The average detection sensitivity, false positive rate and early detection period attain 100%, 0.1/h, and 7.1 s respectively. Conclusion: This paper provides a strategy to characterize EEG signals using a NMM-related method and the model parameters optimized by real EEG may then serve as features in their own right for early seizure detection. Significance: An useful attempt to early detect epileptic seizures by combining the neural mass model with data analysis.

In the present study, we investigated the altered cortical activation and functional network in PTSD patients using electroencephalogram (EEG) measured during an auditory cognitive task. A time-series of neuronal activities was reconstructed using EEG from 25 PTSD patients and 25 healthy controls (HC). PTSD patients showed an unclear P300 event-related potential (ERP) waveform and significantly different power spectrum compared to HC. In addition, the altered network indices (low strength and clustering coefficient, but enhanced path length) appeared in PTSD patients, and the reduced nodal clustering coefficients were significantly related to symptom scores. Finally, we achieved the best classification of 80.00 % when differentiating PTSD patients and HC based on network features.

The road accidents can be avoided by the discrimination of alertness and drowsiness states of the drives. The neurological changes in alertness and drowsiness states can be asses by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this paper, the non stationary characteristic of the EEG signal is explored by tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). TQWT decomposes the EEG signal into sub-bands, which further used for the extraction of features. Statistical features of the Hjorth mobility such as minimum value, maximum value, mean and standard deviation (SD) are used for characterization of the alertness and drowsiness states. Various classifiers such as decision tree, logistic regression, fine Gaussian support vector machine, weighted KNN, ensemble boosted trees and extreme learning machine (ELM) are considered. The alertness and drowsiness EEG signals discriminative performance of TQWT-based features are assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test. The results of KW-test show that the proposed features are effectively discriminative of the alertness and drowsiness states. According to the obtained results, the best accuracy score of 91.842% is produced by the ELM classifier. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Numerous examinations have demonstrated that EEG signals do have profitable data that if effectively broke down, could help in the expectation of seizures in epileptic patients before their event. A few numerical changes have been broke down for its connection with seizure beginning forecast and a progression of analyses were done to ensure their qualities. New calculations are exhibited to help elucidate, screen, and cross-approve the order of EEG signs to foresee the ictal (for example seizure) states, explicitly the preictal, interictal, and postictal states in the mind. These new strategies show promising outcomes in distinguishing the nearness of a preictal stage before the ictal state. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are playing major role in Diagnosis and Predicting the diseases, EEG signal were recorded with 16 channel system from brain scalp and stored in system. From recorded database seizure levels were analyzed from each channel by articrafting with ICA and PCA algorithms and processed through Band pass filter to identify the Delta, Theta, Alpha and Beta levels. After collecting the brain signals from each channel they were bided with FFT to get the data in time domain series. A machine learning model is developed using python programming by sampling on obtained EEG data, sampled data is trained on to the system. Machine Learning algorithms were applied to the data to accuracy and predict the accuracy on developed model neural network is applied to identify the True-False values. The analyzed data is integrated with IOT framework to Diagnosis the Cerebral Palsy patient remotely. Remote monitoring system for the persons with Intellectual disabilities and update the health status to care takers time to time while they are at work. It's also reduces the patient work load by checking his details staying at home rather going to a hospital. If system identifies any changes in patient heart rate, brain signals, body temperature, the system alerts the doctor and respective relatives about patient's status over IOT and also stores the patient details in the cloud.

J	Chao, H; Dong, L; Liu, YL; Lu, BY				Chao, Hao; Dong, Liang; Liu, Yongli; Lu, Baoyun			Improved Deep Feature Learning by Synchronization Measurements for Multi-Channel EEG Emotion Recognition	COMPLEXITY			English	Article								Emotion recognition based on multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a key research area in the field of affective computing. Traditional methods extract EEG features from each channel based on extensive domain knowledge and ignore the spatial characteristics and global synchronization information across all channels. This paper proposes a global feature extraction method that encapsulates the multichannel EEG signals into gray images. The maximal information coefficient (MIC) for all channels was first measured. Subsequently, an MIC matrix was constructed according to the electrode arrangement rules and represented by an MIC gray image. Finally, a deep learning model designed with two principal component analysis convolutional layers and a nonlinear transformation operation extracted the spatial characteristics and global interchannel synchronization features from the constructed feature images, which were then input to support vector machines to perform the emotion recognition tasks. Experiments were conducted on the benchmark dataset for emotion analysis using EEG, physiological, and video signals. The experimental results demonstrated that the global synchronization features and spatial characteristics are beneficial for recognizing emotions and the proposed deep learning model effectively mines and utilizes the two salient features.

As a noninvasive monitoring method to record brain electrical activities, EEG has been widely used for capturing the underlying dynamics of disruptive neuronal responses across the brain in real-time to provide clinical guidance in support of epileptic seizure treatments in practice. In this study, we introduce a novel dynamic learning method that first infers a time-varying network constituted by multivariate EEG signals, which represents the overall dynamics of the brain network, and subsequently quantifies its topological property using graph theory. We demonstrate the efficacy of our learning method to detect relatively strong synchronization (characterized by the algebraic connectivity metric) caused by abnormal neuronal firing during a seizure onset. The computational results for a realistic scalp EEG database show a detection rate of 93.6% and a false positive rate of 0.16 per hour (FP/h); furthermore, our method observes potential pre-seizure phenomena in some cases.

Herein, we propose a system that adopts the brain-computer interface technology to control prosthetic fingers with the use of brain signals. To predict the movements of each finger, complex electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing algorithms should be applied to remove the outliers, extract features, and be able to handle separately the five human fingers. The proposed method deals with a multi-class classification problem. Our machine learning strategy to solve this problem is built on an ensemble of one-class classifiers, each of which is dedicated to the prediction of the intention to move a specific finger. Regions of the brain that are sensitive to the movements of the fingers are identified and located. The average accuracy of the proposed EEG signal processing chain reached 81% for five subjects. Unlike the majority of existing prototypes that allow only one single finger to be controlled and only one movement to be performed at a time, the system proposed will enable multiple fingers to perform movements simultaneously. Although the proposed system classifies five tasks, the obtained accuracy is too high compared with a binary classification system. The proposed system contributes to the advancement of a novel prosthetic solution that allows people with severe disabilities to perform daily tasks in an easy manner.

J	Ergun, E; Aydemir, O				Ergun, Ebru; Aydemir, Onder			A new evolutionary preprocessing approach for classification of mental arithmetic based EEG signals	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Electroencephalography; Preprocessing; Evolutionary approach; Fusion method; Feature extraction; Classification	PERFORMANCE; ARTIFACTS; REMOVAL	Brain computer interface systems decode brain activities from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and translate the user's intentions into commands to control and/or communicate with augmentative or assistive devices without activating any muscle or peripheral nerve. In this paper, we aimed to improve the accuracy of these systems using improved EEG signal processing techniques through a novel evolutionary approach (fusion-based preprocessing method). This approach was inspired by chromosomal crossover, which is the transfer of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. In this study, the proposed fusion-based preprocessing method was applied to an open access dataset collected from 29 subjects. Then, features were extracted by the autoregressive model and classified by k-nearest neighbor classifier. We achieved classification accuracy (CA) ranging from 67.57 to 99.70% for the detection of binary mental arithmetic (MA) based EEG signals. In addition to obtaining an average CA of 88.71%, 93.10% of the subjects showed performance improvement using the fusion-based preprocessing method. Furthermore, we compared the proposed study with the common average reference (CAR) method and without applying any preprocessing method. The achieved results showed that the proposed method provided 3.91% and 2.75% better CA then the CAR and without applying any preprocessing method, respectively. The results also prove that the proposed evolutionary preprocessing approach has great potential to classify the EEG signals recorded during MA task.

In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain variables across subjects in emotional processes. Hence, the states of the latent variables that relate to emotional processing must contribute to building robust recognition models. Specifically, we propose to utilize an unsupervised deep generative model (e.g., variational autoencoder) to determine the latent factors from the multichannel EEG. Through a sequence modeling method, we examine the emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public datasets (DEAP and SEED) and compared with traditional matrix factorization-based (ICA) and autoencoder-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that autoencoder-like neural networks are suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling, and our proposed emotion recognition framework achieves an inspiring performance. As far as we know, it is the first work that introduces variational autoencoder into multichannel EEG decoding for emotion recognition. We think the approach proposed in this work is not only feasible in emotion recognition but also promising in diagnosing depression, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, etc., whose specific latent processes may be altered or aberrant compared with the normal healthy control.

SLEEP AND BREATHING			English	Article						PLMS; Cortical arousal; Leg movements in sleep; Machine learning; RestEaZe (TM) analyses; Movement analyses	BLOOD-PRESSURE; ASSOCIATION	Purpose Clinical and animal studies indicate frequent small micro-arousals (McA) fragment sleep leading to health complications. McA in humans is defined by changes in EEG and EMG during sleep. Complex EEG recordings during the night are usually required to detect McA-limiting large-scale, prospective studies on McA and their impact on health. Even with the use of EEG, reliably measuring McA can be difficult because of low inter-scorer reliability. Surrogate measures in place of EEG could provide easier and possibly more reliable measures of McA. These have usually involved measuring heart rate and arm movements. They have not provided a reliable measurement of McA in part because they cannot adequately detect short wake periods and periods of wake after sleep onset. Leg movements in sleep (LMS) offer an attractive alternative. LMS and cortical arousal, including McA, commonly occur together. Not all McA occur with LMS, but the most clinically significant ones may be those with LMS [1]. Conversely, most LMS do not occur with McA, but LMS vary considerably in their characteristics. Evaluating LMS characteristics may serve to identify the LMS associated with McA. The use of standard machine learning approaches seems appropriate for this particular task. This proof-of-concept pilot project aims to determine the feasibility of detecting McA from machine learning methods analyzing movement characteristics of the LMS. Methods This study uses a small but diverse group of subjects to provide a large variety of LMS and McA adequate for supervised machine learning. LMS measurements were obtained from a new advanced technology in the RestEaZe (TM) leg band that integrates gyroscope, accelerometer, and capacitance measurements. Eleven RestEaZe (TM) LMS features were selected for logistic regression analyses. Results With the optimum logit probability threshold selected, the system accurately detected 76% of the McA matching the accuracy of trained visual inter-scorer reliability (71-76%). The classifier provided a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 86% for the identification of the LMS with McA. The classifier identified regions in sleep with high versus low rates of LMS with McA, indicating possible areas of fragmented versus undisturbed restful sleep. Conclusion These pilot data are encouraging as a preliminary proof-of-concept for using advanced machine learning analyses of LMS to identify sleep fragmented by McA.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes with structural brain lesions including focal abnormalities or asymmetric slow-spike-wave (SSW) patterns remain largely unknown. Due to the contradictory lateralization difference between MRI lesions and EEG pattern in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes, it is difficult to determine the precise lateralization of epileptic lesions, which is crucial to better surgical prognosis. This study is aim to ascertain the clinical characteristics of the EEG patterns, and its relationship with MRI lesions and to evaluate its prognostic value of surgical treatment in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Methods: Twenty-four symptomatic LGS cases with asymmetric EEG SSW patterns and contralaterally independent or contralaterally dominant MRI lesions were collected, and their clinical features were analyzed retrospectively. Results: In this cohort, most of lesions were perinatal or acquired during the first 6 months of life. The most common etiology was intracerebral hemorrhage. The LGS patients with both asymmetric SSW and focal sporadic epileptic waves (SEW) patterns showed the best surgical outcome with Engel class I level. Asymmetric SSW patterns with maximal discharges contralateral to MRI lesions were frequently observed in most of symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Predominantly diffuse destructive lesions led to an attenuated voltage of ipsilateral scalp EEG producing an asymmetric SSW pattern in those patients with symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes. Conclusions: Our study reveals a special SEW EEG pattern in symptomatic LG patients with asymmetric SSW and MRI lesions contralateral to the dominant EEG patterns. Contradictory lateralization difference between MRI and EEG probably arises from the relative voltage attenuation presenting in EEG ipsilateral to huge destructive lesions from early life. Our study suggests that the independent focal SEW activity remaining ipsilateral to the MRI lesion can potentially predict better surgical prognosis in symptomatic LGS or LG phenotypes.

J	Luo, W; Zhou, RL				Luo, Wei; Zhou, Renlai			Can Working Memory Task-Related EEG Biomarkers Measure Fluid Intelligence and Predict Academic Achievement in Healthy Children?	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						event-related potentials; event-related synchronization; fluid intelligence; academic achievement; machine learning	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; GENERAL INTELLIGENCE; SHORT-TERM; P300; LOAD; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION	Background Educational psychology research has linked fluid intelligence (Gf) with working memory (WM), but it is still dubious whether electroencephalography (EEG) markers robustly indicate Gf. This study addresses this issue and notes the relationship between WM task-related EEG markers with Gf and academic performance. Method A sample of 62 healthy children between the ages of 9 and 12 years was selected to perform three tasks: (1) Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test to assess Gf; (2) 2-back task to assess central executive system (CES); and (3) delayed match-to-sample task to assess short-term storage. These subjects were divided into high ability (HA) and low ability (LA) groups based on their RSPM scores. Support vector machine and logistic regression were used to train the EEG candidate indicators. A multiple regression was used to predict children's academic performance using P3 amplitude, P2 latency, and theta-ERS. Results Behavioral results demonstrated that the correct rate of the HA group is higher than that of the LA group. The event-related potential results of the 2-back task showed that the P3 amplitude of the HA group was relatively larger and that the P2 latency was shorter than that observed in the LA group. For the delayed matching to sample task, the theta-ERS of the LA group was higher than that of the HA group. However, the area under the curve of these three indicators for Gf was < 0.75 for each and < 0.85 for the combined indicators. In predicting academic performance, only P3 amplitude showed a significant effect. Conclusion These results challenge previous findings, which reported that P3, P2, or theta power might be used in standard psychometric tests to assess an individual's intelligence.

Epilepsy can affect patients' health and can lead to life-threatening emergencies. Predicting epilepsy before the initiation of the onset is highly effective to avoid the seizure by medication. machine learning algorithms have been implemented in classifying epilepsy from Electroencephalograms (EEG) data. Machine learning algorithms experience reduced performance when classes are imbalanced. The imbalance class problem can be handled by different sampling techniques including oversampling minority class, undersampling majority class, and combined of both. In this paper, both traditional and state-of-the-art sampling techniques have been experimented and evaluated for their capability of improving the imbalance ratio. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) based framework is also presented in this paper. The classification performance has been investigated by applying several ML approaches with the effect of different balancing ratio. We performed experiments on Epileptic Seizure Recognition dataset. The experimental results show that the sampling techniques improve the imbalance class ratio as well as the classification performance.

One of EEG paradigms, motor imagery (MI) is commonly used for recovery or rehabilitation of motor functions due to its signal origin. However, the EEG signals are an oscillatory and non-stationary signal that makes it difficult to collect and classify MI accurately. In this study, we proposed a band-power feature refining convolutional neural network (BFR-CNN) which is composed of two convolution blocks to achieve high classification accuracy. We collected EEG signals to create MI dataset contained the movement imagination of a single-arm. The proposed model outperforms conventional approaches in 4-class MI tasks classification.

This psychological state arises spontaneously and goes with physiological changes that can be recognized by computational methods. In this study, changes in minimum spanning tree (MST) structure of brain functional connectome were used for emotion classification based on EEG data and the obtained results were employed for interpretation about the most informative frequency content of emotional states. For estimation of interaction between different brain regions, several connectivity metrics were applied and interactions were calculated in different frequency bands. Subsequently, the MST graph was extracted from the functional connectivity matrix and its features were used for emotion recognition. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed method for separating emotions with different arousal levels was 88.28%, while for different valence levels it was 81.25%. Interestingly, the system performance for binary classification of emotions based on quadrants of arousal-valence space was also higher than 80%.

Auditory attention decoding (AAD) methods allow to identify the target speaker which the listener is attending to from single-trial EEG recordings. In this paper we propose a cognitive-drivenmulti-microphone speech enhancement system, which combines a neural-network-based mask estimator, weighted minimum power distortionless response convolutional beamformers and AAD. The proposed system allows to enhance the attended speaker and jointly suppress reverberation, the interfering speaker and ambient noise. To control the suppression of the interfering speaker, we also propose an extension incorporating an interference suppression constraint. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art cognitive-driven speech enhancement systems in reverberant and noisy conditions.

In our experiment, 40 BCI-naive subjects were instructed to imagine the movement of clenching his/her right or left hand, in accordance with the visual cue. The activity of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) (8-30 Hz) was measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and transformed into the information transfer rate (ITR) after feature selection and classification. All subjects also completed a self-assessment questionnaire for the determination of their temperament profile, comprising the following traits: Briskness, Perseveration, Sensory Sensitivity, Emotional Reactivity, Endurance, and Activity. We found significant correlations between ITR performance and Endurance (EN) and Perseveration (PE) scores. This effect was also visible in a topography of SMR desynchronization patterns, in groups with different results in EN and PE scales. Finally, a predictive model of motor imagery BCI control based on temperament traits was proposed. We interpret this finding as empirical support for an influence of basic, relatively stable personality traits on BCI control via the performance of the motor imagery task. Moreover, the implication of these results on the design of future brain-computer interfaces was discussed.

Traditional CSP depends only on spatial filtering, that aims to maximize or minimize the ratio of variances of filtered EEG signals in different classes. Recent advances of CSP approaches show that temporal filtering is also preferable to extract discriminative features. In view of this perspective, a novel spatio-temporal filtering strategy is proposed in this paper. To improve computational efficiency and alleviate the overfitting issue frequently encountered in the case of small sample size, the same temporal filter is designed by EEG signals of the same class and shared by all the spatial channels. Spatial and temporal filters can be updated alternatively in practice. Furthermore, each of the resulting designs can still be cast as a CSP problem and tackled efficiently by the eigenvalue decomposition. To alleviate the adverse effects of outliers or noisy EEG channels, sparse spatial or temporal filters can also be achieved by incorporating anl l(1)-norm-based regularization term in our CSP problem. The regularized spatial or temporal filter design is iteratively reformulated as a CSP problem via the reweighting technique. Two sets of motor imagery EEG data of BCI competitions are used in our experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Unlike most of the previous works, which focused on choosing a fixed set of electrodes to detect emotions, this work presents a novel approach that consists of investigating the cerebral activity while experiencing emotions to identify the brain lobes that are showing significant and relevant changes. The identification process of relevant brain lobes is adaptive as the brain activity varies from one person to another and differs from one lobe to another during the same emotional state. The electrodes of the selected brain lobes will be tuned before being used as resources to extract the features that are required for the proposed three phases classification process. Using a clustering technique, the tuning process excludes every electrode that hardly separates between relevant and irrelevant rhythmic brain changes. The results show that the proposed method outperforms all previous approaches. Compared to the best performance obtained by previous studies, the proposed method enhanced the accuracy of both valence and arousal dimensions by 5%. Besides, the accuracy of the dominance dimension was improved by 2%.

Designing an effective classifier with high classification accuracy and strong generalization capability is essential for brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In this study, an extreme learning machine (ELM) based method is proposed to improve the classification accuracy of motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG). Approach. The proposed method constructs an ensemble classifier based on optimized ELMs. Particle swarm optimization is used to simultaneously optimize the input weights and hidden biases of ELM to avoid the randomness and instability of classification result when ELM uses randomly generated parameters, and majority voting strategy is used to fuse the classification results of multiple base classifiers to avoid the negative impact of ELM with local optimal parameters on classification result. The proposed method was compared with four competing methods in experiments based on two public EEG datasets and some existing methods reported in the literature using the same datasets as well. Main results. The results indicate that the proposed method achieved significant higher classification accuracies than those of the competing methods on both two-class and four-class motor imagery data. Moreover, compared to the existing methods, it still obtained superior average accuracies of two-class classification and performed better for the subjects with relatively poor accuracies on both two-class and four-class classifications. Significance. The significant accuracy improvement demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method. It can be a promising candidate for accurate classification of motor imagery EEG in BCI systems.

However, the estimation of the covariance matrices in CSP is sensitive to noise and lacks local temporal information. To improve the performance of CSP, we propose a local temporal joint recurrence common spatial pattern (LTJRCSP), which considers temporally local information. Theoretically, LTJRCSP introduces the local temporal joint recurrence rate and therefore may contain more discriminative information and is more robust compared to CSP. After the feature is extracted, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then applied for classification. The experimental results, regardless of whether EEG dataset Ha of BCI Competition IV introduces outliers or not, justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A space-frequency localized approach of spatial filtering for motor imagery classification	HEALTH INFORMATION SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Motor imagery; Brain computer interface; Space-frequency localization; Spatial filter	EEG; PATTERN	Classification of Motor Imagery (MI) signals is the heart of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based applications. Spatial filtering is an important step in this process that produce new set of signals for better discrimination of two classes of EEG signals. In this work, a new approach of spatial filtering called Space-Frequency Localized Spatial Filtering (SFLSF) is proposed to enhance the performances of MI classification. The SFLSF method initially divides the scalp-EEG channels into local overlapping spatial windows. Then a filter bank is used to divide the signals into local frequency bands. The group of channels, localized in space and frequency, are then processed with spatial filter, and features are subsequently extracted for classification task. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed space localization helps to increase the classification accuracy when compared to the existing methods using spatial filters. The classification performance is further improved when frequency localization is incorporated. Thus, the proposed space-frequency localized approach of spatial filtering helps to deliver better classification result which is consistently 3-5% higher than traditional methods.	[Rahman, M. K.

The deployment of deep neural networks at the edge is however limited by their high memory and energy consumption requirements. With new memory technology available, emerging Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are promising to reduce the energy impact of the forthcoming machine learning hardware generation, enabling machine learning on the edge devices and avoiding data transfer over the network. In this work, after presenting our implementation employing a hybrid CMOS - hafnium oxide resistive memory technology, we suggest strategies to apply BNNs to biomedical signals such as electrocardiography and electroencephalography, keeping accuracy level and reducing memory requirements. We investigate the memory-accuracy trade-off when binarizing whole network and binarizing solely the classifier part. We also discuss how these results translate to the edge-oriented Mobilenet V1 neural network on the Imagenet task. The final goal of this research is to enable smart autonomous healthcare devices.

A hearing aid's noise reduction algorithm cannot infer to which speaker the user intends to listen to. Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms allow to infer this information from neural signals, which leads to the concept of neuro-steered hearing aids. We aim to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of AAD-supported speech enhancement in challenging noisy conditions based on electroencephalography recordings.Approach. The AAD performance with a linear versus a deep neural network (DNN) based speaker separation was evaluated for same-gender speaker mixtures using three different speaker positions and three different noise conditions.Main results. AAD results based on the linear approach were found to be at least on par and sometimes even better than pure DNN-based approaches in terms of AAD accuracy in all tested conditions. However, when using the DNN to support a linear data-driven beamformer, a performance improvement over the purely linear approach was obtained in the most challenging scenarios. The use of multiple microphones was also found to improve speaker separation and AAD performance over single-microphone systems.Significance. Recent proof-of-concept studies in this context each focus on a different method in a different experimental setting, which makes it hard to compare them. Furthermore, they are tested in highly idealized experimental conditions, which are still far from a realistic hearing aid setting. This work provides a systematic comparison of a linear and non-linear neuro-steered speech enhancement model, as well as a more realistic validation in challenging conditions.

Key applications of the system are the maintenance of immobilized patients and rehabilitation procedures. An interface performs imaginary hand movement decoding using electroencephalographic signals. The decoding process consists of several steps: (1) signal acquisition; (2) signal preprocessing (filtering, artefact removal); (3) feature extraction; (4) classification. The study is focused on obtaining the best accuracy of decoding by comparing different feature extraction and classification methods. Several methods (Riemannian geometry-based) were tested offline.

Nevertheless, performance depends on the feature extraction phase, where the aim is to find relevant patterns related to different mental activities. Thus, in this work, an approach to extract features from EEG signals is proposed based on spectrograms: Firstly, STFT is applied to EEG to obtain time-frequency representations, where parameters such as window length and type are experimented based on the EEG signal frequency. After that, spectral peaks are found to be used as reference in order to obtain descriptors per spectrogram. Three ways for extracting features from EEG are presented, the first based on frequency and surfaces, the second using K-means to extract features and the adaptation of local ternary pattern, and finally, a third using maximum peaks. The extracted descriptors are evaluated by means of a multilayer perceptron, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. The proposed approach was evaluated using the dataset from Bonn University, identifying a healthy person and an epileptic attack classes as main task. According to the experimental results, the proposed method obtains acceptable accuracy (100%) in several cases by considering fewer features than those extracted by other related works.

The EEG signal has very important information about brain activities and disorders which can detect by an accurate Computer-aided diagnosis system. The performance of the Computer-aided diagnosis system directly depends on using features in the classifiers. In this paper, we proposed nonlinear geometrical features for the classification of EEG signals. The normal, interictal and ictal EEG signals of the Bonn university EEG database are plotted in 2D space by a novel approach and considering their patterns, six features namely: area of the octagon (AOO), circle area (CA), the summation of vectors length (SVL), centroid to centroid (CTC) and triangle area (TA) are extracted on different aspects of distance in Cartesian space. Based on the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test, all of the features were found statistically significant in the discrimination of normal vs. ictal and interictal vs. ictal EEG signals (p-value approximate to 0). Also, the edges of 2D projection EEG signals in the ictal group were sharper than normal and interictal groups. Besides, 2D projection of normal and interictal EEG signals has more regular geometrical shapes than the ictal group. Our proposed features were applied as input on support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers which resulted in more than 99% classification accuracy in a ten-fold cross-validation strategy.

Machine Learning techniques are required to expand the understanding of oscillatory signatures. In this work, we propose a methodological pipeline to develop machine learning models for the classification between expert and nonexpert meditative state. We carried out this study utilizing the online repository consisting of EEG dataset of 24 meditators that categorized as 12 experts and 12 nonexperts meditators. The pipeline consists of four stages that include feature engineering, machine learning classifiers, feature selection, and visualization. We decomposed signals using five wavelet families consisting of Haar, Biorthogonal(1.3-6.8), Daubechies( orders 2-10), Coiflet(orders 1-5), and Symlet(2-8), followed by feature extraction using relative entropy and power. We classified the meditative state between expert and non-expert meditators employing twelve classifiers to build machine learning models. Wavelet coefficients d8 shows the maximum classification accuracy in all the wavelet families. Wavelet orders Bior3.5 and Coif3 produce the maximum classification performance with the detail coefficient d8 using relative power. We have successfully classified the meditative state between expert and non-expert with 100% accuracy using d5,d6,d7,d8,a8 coefficients. Multi-Layer Perceptron and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis attain the highest accuracy. We have figured out the most discriminating channels during classification and reported 20 channels involving frontal, central and parietal regions. We plot the high dimensional structure of data by utilizing two feature reduction techniques PCA and t-SNE.

This study aims to investigate alterations of brain connectivity using multivariate electroencephalographic data to provide new insights of the brain connectivity dynamics of dystonia. Approach. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) of patients with right upper limb idiopathic focal dystonia and paired controls during resting state, writing-from-memory, and finger-tapping tasks. We applied power spectrum analyses considering the mu, beta and gamma rhythms of the motor cortex and analyzed brain connectivity networks and microstates (MS). Main results. The power spectra results showed that patients had a loss of desynchronization of the beta rhythm during the writing task. We observed differences in the structure of the connective core in beta rhythm, as well as, in the intensity of the patient's hubs observed with basis in path length measures in mu and beta rhythms. Abnormalities were also identified in MS of default mode networks of patients associated with its performances during motor tasks. Significance. The EEG connectivity analyses provided interesting insights about the cortical electrophysiological patterns in dystonia, such as loss of event-related desynchronization, changes in the effective connectivity with similar signature to other neurological diseases, indications of alterations in the default-mode-network. Our findings are consistent with previously described connectivity abnormalities in neuroimaging studies confirming that dystonia is a network disorder.

The research results show that the model can realize end-to-end learning of a small amount of original sleep EEG data, and the overall classification effect is better than that of recent high-level models. Due to its end-to-end characteristics, compared with the traditional machine learning model based on feature engineering, the proposed model is more suitable for split personalized sleep monitoring equipment equipped with remote servers.

In this article, we develop a simple and feasible concealed information test (CIT) method which is based on the audio-visual event-related potentials (ERPs) and its spatial and temporal features. The main purpose of this article is to extend a pattern recognition method with functional network parameters and global feature entropy of the EEG signals from the whole brain. At the same time, a novel quantum neural network (QNN) classifier was developed to distinguish the guilty and innocent conditions. Functional connectivity can provide extra information of interdependence between different brain regions from the spatial dimension, and entropy can reflect the complexity of the whole brain from the temporal dimension. 20 subjects participated in the CIT experiment and 30 channel ERPs were recorded. A high accuracy of 87.67% was got in recognizing the concealed information, which was higher than 85.43% for basic features, demonstrated the effectiveness of this article. Future studies should further clarify the connectivity difference and further improve the accuracy of the QNN classifier for CIT.

Participants memorize a set of items and then, try to detect changes in the set after a retention period. The negative slow wave (NSW) and contralateral delay activity (CDA) are event-related potentials in the EEG signal that are commonly used in change detection tasks to track working memory load, as both increase with the number of items maintained in working memory (set size). While the CDA was argued to more purely reflect the memory-specific neural activity than the NSW, it also requires a lateralized design and attention shifts prior to memoranda onset, imposing more restrictions on the task than the NSW. The present study proposes a novel change detection task in which both CDA and NSW can be measured at the same time. Memory items were presented bilaterally, but their distribution in the left and right hemifield varied, inducing a target imbalance or "net load." NSW increased with set size, whereas CDA increased with net load. In addition, a multivariate linear classifier was able to decode the set size and net load from the EEG signal. CDA, NSW, and decoding accuracy predicted an individual's working memory capacity. In line with the notion of a bilateral advantage in working memory, accuracy, and CDA data suggest that participants tended to encode items relatively balanced.

CND's, such as Alzheimer's, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), are the chronic ailment of the central nervous system that causes the degradation of emotional and cognitive abilities. Long term continuous monitoring with neuro-feedback of human emotions for patients with CND's is crucial in mitigating its harmful effect. This paper presents hardware efficient and dedicated human emotion classification processor for CND's. Scalp EEG is used for the emotion's classification using the valence and arousal scales. A linear support vector machine classifier is used with power spectral density, logarithmic interhemispheric power spectral ratio, and the interhemispheric power spectral difference of eight EEG channel locations suitable for a wearable non-invasive classification system. A look-up-table based logarithmic division unit (LDU) is to represent the division features in machine learning (ML) applications. The implemented LDU minimizes the cost of integer division by 34% for ML applications. The implemented emotion's classification processor achieved an accuracy of 72.96% and 73.14%, respectively, for the valence and arousal classification on multiple publicly available datasets. The 2 x 3mm(2) processor is fabricated using a 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS process with power and energy utilization of 2.04 mW and 16 mu J/classification, respectively, for 8-channel operation.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies are used to detect seizures or other epileptiform patterns. This review seeks to clarify EEG findings relevant to ABI, explore practical barriers limiting EEG implementation, discuss strategies to leverage EEG monitoring in various clinical settings, and suggest an approach to utilize EEG for triage. Recent Findings Current literature suggests there is an increased morbidity and mortality risk associated with seizures or patterns on the ictal-interictal continuum (IIC) due to ABI. Further, increased use of EEG is associated with better clinical outcomes. However, there are many logistical barriers to successful EEG implementation that prohibit its ubiquitous use. Solutions to these limitations include the use of rapid EEG systems, non-expert EEG analysis, machine learning algorithms, and the incorporation of EEG data into prognostic models.

EEGbased motor imagery paradigm is widely used in non-invasive BCI to obtain encoded signals contained user intention of movement execution. However, EEG has intricate and non-stationary properties resulting in insufficient decoding performance. By imagining numerous movements of a singlearm, decoding performance can be improved without artificial command matching. In this study, we collected intuitive EEG data contained the nine different types of movements of a single-arm from 9 subjects. We propose an end-to-end role assigned convolutional neural network (ERA-CNN) which considers discriminative features of each upper limb region by adopting the principle of a hierarchical CNN architecture. The proposed model outperforms previous methods on 3-class, 5-class and two different types of 7-class classification tasks. Hence, we demonstrate the possibility of decoding user intention by using only EEG signals with robust performance using the ERA-CNN.

To counter this, biometric authentication has been proposed: the use of distinctive physiological and behavioral characteristics as a form of identification and access control. One of the recent developments is electroencephalography (EEG)-based authentication. It builds on the subject-specific nature of brain responses which are difficult to recreate artificially. We propose an authentication system based on EEG signals recorded in response to a simple motor paradigm. Authentication is achieved with a novel two-stage decoder. In the first stage, EEG signal features are extracted using an inception- and a VGG-like deep learning neural network (NN) both of which we compare with principal component analysis (PCA). In the second stage, a support vector machine (SVM) is used for binary classification to authenticate the subject based on the extracted features. All decoders are trained on EEG motor-movement data recorded from 105 subjects. We achieved with the VGG-like NN-SVM decoder a false-acceptance rate (FAR) of 2.55% with an overall accuracy of 88.29%, a FAR of 3.33% with an accuracy of 87.47%, and a FAR of 2.89% with an accuracy of 90.68% for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively. With the Inception-like NN-SVM decoder we achieved a false-acceptance rate (FAR) of 4.08% with an overall accuracy of 87.29%, a FAR of 3.53% with an accuracy of 85.31%, and a FAR of 1.27% with an accuracy of 93.40% for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively. The PCA-SVM decoder achieved accuracies of 92.09%, 92.36%, and 95.64% with FARs of 2.19%, 2.17%, and 1.26% for 8, 16, and 64 channels, respectively.

This research considers classification of negative emotions using EEG signals in response to emotional clips. This paper introduces a long short term memory deep learning (LSTM) network to recognize emotions using EEG signals. The primary goal of this approach is to assess the classification performance of the LSTM model for classifying emotions. The secondary goal is to assess the human behavior of different age groups and genders. We have compared the performance of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Belief Network based SVM (DBN-SVM), and LSTM based deep learning model for classification of negative emotions using brain signals. The analysis shows that for four class of negative emotion recognition LSTM based deep learning model provides classification accuracy as 81.63%, 84.64%, 89.73%, and 92.84% for 50-50, 60-40, 70-30, and 10-fold cross-validation. Generalizability and reliability of this approach is evaluated by applying our approach to publicly available EEG dataset DEAP and SEED. In compliance with the self-reported feelings, brain signals of 26-35 years of age group provided the highest emotional identification. Among genders, females are more emotionally active as compared to males.

J	Zhou, MR; Bian, K; Hu, F; Lai, WH				Zhou, Mengran; Bian, Kai; Hu, Feng; Lai, Wenhao			A New Method Based on CEEMD Combined With Iterative Feature Reduction for Aided Diagnosis of Epileptic EEG	FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						intelligent diagnosis; EEG signals; complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition; feature reduction; gray wolf optimizer	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SEIZURE DETECTION; GENE SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION	In the clinical diagnosis of epileptic diseases, the intelligent diagnosis of epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has become a research focus in the field of brain diseases. In order to solve the problem of time-consuming and easily influenced by human subjective factors, artificial intelligence pattern recognition algorithm has been applied to EEG signals recognition. However, at present, the common empirical mode decomposition (EMD) signal decomposition algorithm does not consider the problem of mode aliasing. The EEG features obtained by feature extraction may be mixed with some unimportant features that affect the classification accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a new method based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) combined with iterative feature reduction for aided diagnosis of epileptic EEG. First of all, the evaluation indexes of decomposing and reconstructing signals by several methods were compared. The CEEMD was selected as the decomposition method of the signals. Then, the support vector machine recursive elimination (SVM-RFE) was used to reduce 9 features extracted from EEG data. The support vector classification of the gray wolf optimizer (GWO-SVC) recognition model was established for different feature subsets. By comparing the classification accuracy of training set and test set of different feature subsets, and considering the complexity of the model reflected by the number of features selected by SVM-RFE, the analysis showed that the 6 feature subsets with fewer features and higher classification accuracy could reflect the key information of epileptic EEG. The accuracy of the training set classification was 99.38% and the test set was as high as 100%. The recognition time was only 1.6551 s. Finally, in order to verify the reliability of the algorithm proposed in this paper, the proposed algorithm compared with the classification model established by the raw EEG signals and the optimization model established by other intelligent optimization algorithms. It is found that the algorithm used in this paper has higher classification accuracy and faster recognition time than other processing methods. The experimental results show that CEEMD combined with SVM-RFE is feasible for rapid and accurate recognition of EEG signals, which provides a theoretical basis for the aided diagnosis of epilepsy.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the computational infrastructure to support this with an emphasis on how we efficiently process EEG signal data from multiple sources and manage all of the corresponding information. If each annotator is better than 50% accurate, increasing the number of annotators for annotation tasks will result in higher and higher reliability of the annotation. Our platform enables new approaches to quantifying the accuracy of annotations based on the annotators' accuracy, expertise, and relevant experience.

Improved motor imagery brain-computer interface performance via adaptive modulation filtering and two-stage classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Motor imagery; Adaptive modulation filtering; Multi-stage classification	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BCI	Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) monitor neural activity and translate these signals into actions and/or decisions, with the final goal of enabling users to interact with a computer using only their thoughts. To this end, users must produce specific neural activity patterns that are used by the system as control signals. A common task used to elicit such signals is motor imagery (MI), where specific patterns are elicited in the sensorimotor cortex during imagination of movements (e.g., of the hands, arms, feet or tongue). The processing pipeline typically used in EEG-BCIs consists of three stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Here, we propose innovations in pre-processing and classification and quantify the gains achieved on 4-class MI-based BCI performance. More specifically, for the pre-processing stage, we propose the concept of spectro-temporal filtering as we show that MI-elicited neural patterns have varying amplitude modulation variations relative to artifacts. For the classification stage, in turn, a two-step classification method is proposed. First, LDA classifiers are used to discriminate between different pair-wise MI tasks. Next, a naive Bayes classifier is used to predict the final task performed by the user based on the weighted outputs of the LDA classifiers. Experimental results showed that the proposed system outperformed the first-place winner of the BCI competition IV by 3.5 %. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, a recent review (Pulini et al. 2018) identified methodological errors in neuroimaging, including EEG, ADHD classification studies. Therefore, the specific EEG neuromarkers of adult ADHD remain to be identified, as do the EEG characteristics that mediate between genes and behaviour (mediational endophenotypes). Resting-state eyes-open and eyes-closed EEG was measured from 38 adults with ADHD, 45 first-degree relatives of people with ADHD and 51 unrelated controls. A machine learning classification analysis using penalized logistic regression (Elastic Net) examined if EEG spectral power (1-45 Hz) and TBR could classify participants into ADHD, first-degree relatives and/or control groups. Random-label permutation was used to quantify any bias in the analysis. Eyes-open absolute and relative EEG power distinguished ADHD from control participants (area under receiver operating characteristic = 0.71-0.77). The best predictors of ADHD status were increased power in delta, theta and low-alpha over centro-parietal regions, and in frontal low-beta and parietal mid-beta. TBR did not successfully classify ADHD status. Elevated eyes-open power in delta, theta, low-alpha and low-beta distinguished first-degree relatives from controls (area under receiver operating characteristic = 0.68-0.72), suggesting that these features may be a mediational endophenotype for adult ADHD. Resting-state EEG spectral power may be a neuromarker and mediational endophenotype of adult ADHD. These results did not support TBR as a diagnostic neuromarker for ADHD. It is possible that TBR is a characteristic of childhood ADHD.

The phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD makes timely and accurate diagnosis challenging, requiring highly trained clinical practitioners. The development of automated approaches to ASD classification, based on integrated psychophysiological measures, may one day help expedite the diagnostic process. This paper provides a novel contribution for classifing ASD using both thermographic and EEG data. The methodology used in this study extracts a variety of feature sets and evaluates the possibility of using several learning models. Mean, standard deviation, and entropy values of the EEG signals and mean temperature values of regions of interest (ROIs) in facial thermographic images were extracted as features. Feature selection is performed to filter less informative features based on correlation. The classification process utilizes Naive Bayes, random forest, logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptron algorithms. The integration of EEG and thermographic features have achieved an accuracy of 94% with both logistic regression and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. The results have shown that the classification accuracies of most of the learning models have increased after integrating facial thermographic data with EEG.

Also, in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, memory problems are a frequently encountered problem with potential progression. On the background of a unifying hypothesis for cognitive decline, we merged knowledge from dementia and epilepsy research in order to identify biomarkers with a high predictive value for cognitive decline across and beyond these groups that can be fed into intelligent systems. We prospectively assessed patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (N = 9), mild cognitive impairment (N = 19), and subjective cognitive complaints (N = 4) and healthy controls (N = 18). All had structural cerebral MRI, EEG at rest and during declarative verbal memory performance, and a neuropsychological assessment which was repeated after 18 months. Cognitive decline was defined as significant change on neuropsychological subscales. We extracted volumetric and shape features from MRI and brain network measures from EEG and fed these features alongside a baseline testing in neuropsychology into a machine learning framework with feature subset selection and 5-fold cross validation. Out of 50 patients, 27 had a decline over time in executive functions, 23 in visual-verbal memory, 23 in divided attention, and 7 patients had an increase in depression scores. The best sensitivity/specificity for decline was 72%/82% for executive functions based on a feature combination from MRI volumetry and EEG partial coherence during recall of memories; 95%/74% for visual-verbal memory by combination of MRI-wavelet features and neuropsychology; 84%/76% for divided attention by combination of MRI-wavelet features and neuropsychology; and 81%/90% for increase of depression by combination of EEG partial directed coherence factor at rest and neuropsychology. Combining information from EEG, MRI, and neuropsychology in order to predict neuropsychological changes in a heterogeneous population could create a more general model of cognitive performance decline.

Unlike some existing machine learning models for EEG analysis, we did not rely on any hand-crafted feature engineering and elaborate pipeline design. Furthermore, apart from some existing deep learning frameworks based on some off-the-self existing modules, we introduced the orthogonal constrained recurrent neural network (OCRNN) as the downstream module after the spatial-temporal expansion and representation provided by the one dimensional convolutional neural networks. We evaluated our model using the EEG-based sleep datasets for sleep stage scoring. We compared the performances of four types of RNN frameworks, where three of them are OCRNNs. The results show that OCRNN can achieve competitive better F1 score, accuracy and AUC score compared to the previous baseline results. Moreover, our model (orRNN and pdRNN) can achieve the above results with less number of parameters and less number of training epochs, which demonstrate its potential usage to launch approximate real-time medical diagnosis.

In this study, a novel feature extraction network based on local graph structure (LGS) is utilized for EEG signal classification. The aim of this work is to create a framework which utilize ensemble of LGS that uses logically extended LGS, symmetric LGS, vertical LGS, vertical symmetric LGS, zigzag horizontal LGS, zigzag horizontal middle LGS, zigzag vertical LGS and zigzag vertical middle LGS. By using these LGS methods with discrete wavelet transform (DWT), a novel ensemble feature extraction network is formed. In this framework, LGSs are utilized for feature extraction and 2D-DWT is utilized for pooling. In the feature reduction phase, two widely known feature reduction techniques, namely ReliefF and neighborhood component analysis (NCA) are used together. Five different benchmark classifiers are employed to present the strength of the proposed ensemble feature extraction framework. In the experiments, two publicly available EEG datasets have been employed to test the proposed ensemble LGS feature extraction based multilevel EEG signal classification method. The proposed ensemble LGS method achieved 97.20% and 98.67% success rate for these datasets. Six cases were also examined to comprehensively evaluate the used Bonn dataset. Results clearly illustrated the success of the ensemble LGS based EEG classification method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such systems can be used to provide assistance to humans in tasks where a certain level of alertness is required, like in surgery or in the operation of heavy machines, among others. In this work, we extend a previous study where a classification system is proposed using a Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for the classification of two mental states, namely a relaxed and a normal state. Here, we propose an enhanced feature extraction algorithm (Augmented Feature Extraction with Genetic Programming, or+FEGP) that improves upon previous results by employing a Genetic-Programming-based methodology on top of the CSP. The proposed algorithm searches for non-linear transformations that build new features and simplify the classification task. Although the proposed algorithm can be coupled with any classifier, LDA achieves 78.8% accuracy, the best predictive accuracy among tested classifiers, significantly improving upon previously published results on the same real-world dataset.

BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Review						Gait; EEG; oscillations	ANTICIPATORY POSTURAL ADJUSTMENTS; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; PEDUNCULOPONTINE NUCLEUS; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; STEP INITIATION; STIMULUS-DRIVEN; MOTOR; MOVEMENT; ATTENTION; SYNCHRONIZATION	Gait is often considered as an automatic movement but cortical control seems necessary to adapt gait pattern with environmental constraints. In order to study cortical activity during real locomotion, electroencephalography (EEG) appears to be particularly appropriate. It is now possible to record changes in cortical neural synchronization/desynchronization during gait. Studying gait initiation is also of particular interest because it implies motor and cognitive cortical control to adequately perform a step. Time-frequency analysis enables to study induced changes in EEG activity in different frequency bands. Such analysis reflects cortical activity implied in stabilized gait control but also in more challenging tasks (obstacle crossing, changes in speed, dual tasks horizontal ellipsis ). These spectral patterns are directly influenced by the walking context but, when analyzing gait with a more demanding attentional task, cortical areas other than the sensorimotor cortex (prefrontal, posterior parietal cortex, etc.) seem specifically implied. While the muscular activity of legs and cortical activity are coupled, the precise role of the motor cortex to control the level of muscular contraction according to the gait task remains debated. The decoding of this brain activity is a necessary step to build valid brain-computer interfaces able to generate gait artificially.

Older listeners with age-related sensorineural hearing loss (presbycusis) often struggle to understand speech in such situations, even when wearing a hearing aid. Yet, it is unclear whether a peripheral hearing loss degrades the attentional modulation of cortical speech tracking. Here, we used psychoacoustics and electroencephalography (EEG) in male and female human listeners to examine potential effects of hearing loss on EEG correlates of speech envelope synchronization in cortex. Behaviorally, older hearing-impaired (HI) listeners showed degraded speech-in-noise recognition and reduced temporal acuity compared with age-matched normal-hearing (NH) controls. During EEG recordings, we used a selective attention task with two spatially separated simultaneous speech streams where NH and HI listeners both showed high speech recognition performance. Low-frequency (<10 Hz) envelope-entrained EEG responses were enhanced in the HI listeners, both for the attended speech, but also for tone sequences modulated at slow rates (4 Hz) during passive listening. Compared with the attended speech, responses to the ignored stream were found to be reduced in both HI and NH listeners, allowing for the attended target to be classified from single-trial EEG data with similar high accuracy in the two groups. However, despite robust attention-modulated speech entrainment, the HI listeners rated the competing speech task to be more difficult. These results suggest that speech-in-noise problems experienced by older HI listeners are not necessarily associated with degraded attentional selection.

J	Mercier, MR; Cappe, C				Mercier, Manuel R.; Cappe, Celine			The interplay between multisensory integration and perceptual decision making	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multisensory integration; Perceptual decision making; Supervised machine learning; EEG decoding; Race model; Drift diffusion model	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RACE MODEL; TUTORIAL; TIME; NEUROBIOLOGY; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; PSYCHOLOGY	Facing perceptual uncertainty, the brain combines information from different senses to make optimal perceptual decisions and to guide behavior. However, decision making has been investigated mostly in unimodal contexts. Thus, how the brain integrates multisensory information during decision making is still unclear. Two opposing, but not mutually exclusive, scenarios are plausible: either the brain thoroughly combines the signals from different modalities before starting to build a supramodal decision, or unimodal signals are integrated during decision formation. To answer this question, we devised a paradigm mimicking naturalistic situations where human participants were exposed to continuous cacophonous audiovisual inputs containing an unpredictable signal cue in one or two modalities and had to perform a signal detection task or a cue categorization task. First, model-based analyses of behavioral data indicated that multisensory integration takes place alongside perceptual decision making. Next, using supervised machine learning on concurrently recorded EEG, we identified neural signatures of two processing stages: sensory encoding and decision formation. Generalization analyses across experimental conditions and time revealed that multisensory cues were processed faster during both stages. We further established that acceleration of neural dynamics during sensory encoding and decision formation was directly linked to multisensory integration. Our results were consistent across both signal detection and categorization tasks. Taken together, the results revealed a continuous dynamic interplay between multisensory integration and decision making processes (mixed scenario), with integration of multimodal information taking place both during sensory encoding as well as decision formation.

Perturbation-evoked potentials can be classified from single-trial EEG	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						passive brain-computer interface; perturbation-evoked potential; human-machine interaction; EEG; machine learning; rehabilitation; assistive device	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; STANCE; GAIT; MOVEMENT; AFFERENT	Objective.Loss of balance control can have serious consequences on interaction between humans and machines as well as the general well-being of humans. Perceived balance perturbations are always accompanied by a specific cortical activation, the so-called perturbation-evoked potential (PEP). In this study, we investigate the possibility to classify PEPs from ongoing EEG.Approach.Fifteen healthy subjects were exposed to seated whole-body perturbations. Each participant performed 120 trials; they were rapidly tilted to the right and left, 60 times respectively.Main results.We achieved classification accuracies of more than 85% between PEPs and rest EEG using a window-based classification approach. Different window lengths and electrode layouts were compared. We were able to achieve excellent classification performance (87.6 +/- 8.0% accuracy) by using a short window length of 200 ms and a minimal electrode layout consisting of only the Cz electrode. The peak classification accuracy coincides in time with the strongest component of PEPs, called N1.Significance.We showed that PEPs can be discriminated against ongoing EEG with high accuracy. These findings can contribute to the development of a system that can detect balance perturbations online.

Accuracy and neural correlates of blinded mediumship compared to controls on an image classification task	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Intuition; Mediumship; Electroencephalography; Behavior; Machine-learning	POTENTIALS; COMPONENT; MEDIA; ERP	In this study, a classification task asked participants to look at 180 facial photographs of deceased individuals (photographs were taken years prior to their deaths) and guess the cause of death from three equiprobable categories: heart attack; death by firearm; or car accident. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) data were simultaneously collected during the task. The participants included individuals who claimed "mediumistic" (psychic) abilities and controls who claimed no mediumistic ability. Pooled data showed accurate guesses for the cause of death (partial eta(2) = 0.12; p = 0.004), and control subjects were primarily responsible for this effect (partial eta(2) = 0.11; p = 0.005). EEG and ECG differences were found between the mediums and controls. Control participants had larger amplitude event-related potentials (ERP) following the presentation of the images than the mediums, between 80 and 110 ms, and between 200 and 350 ms. This could be interpreted as reflecting greater attention and less response inhibition by controls as compared to the mediums. Participants in the control group also had lower average heart rates than the mediums, possibly indicating less stress during the task. Speculations and limits regarding why controls performed better than mediums are discussed.

In this pattern recognition study, the first time the authors have attempted to use time domain (TD) features such as waveform length (WL), number of zero-crossings (ZC) and number of slope sign changes (SSC) derived directly from filtered EEG data and from discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of filtered EEG data for the detection of an epileptic seizure. Further, the authors attempted to study the performance of other time domain features such as mean absolute value (MAV), standard deviation (SD), average power (AVP), which had been attempted by other researchers. The performance of the TD features is studied using naive Bayes (NB) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers for the university of Bonn database with fourteen different combinations of set E with set A to D. The proposed scheme was also compared with other existing scheme in the literature. The implementation results showed that the proposed scheme could attain the highest accuracy of 100% for normal eyes open and epileptic data set with direct as well as DWT based TD features. For other data sets, the highest accuracy is obtained with DWT based TD features using SVM. However, no significant difference in the classification of 14 data sets with TD features filtered EEG data and from DWT of filtered EEG data.

Decoding of single-trial EEG reveals unique states of functional brain connectivity that drive rapid speech categorization decisions	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						categorical speech perception; machine learning; speech processing; stability selection; functional connectivity	BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION; NEURAL ORGANIZATION; VARIABLE SELECTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SEX-DIFFERENCES; REPRESENTATIONS; NETWORKS; REGIONS	Objective. Categorical perception (CP) is an inherent property of speech perception. The response time (RT) of listeners' perceptual speech identification is highly sensitive to individual differences. While the neural correlates of CP have been well studied in terms of the regional contributions of the brain to behavior, functional connectivity patterns that signify individual differences in listeners' speed (RT) for speech categorization is less clear. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to address these questions. Approach. We applied several computational approaches to the EEG, including graph mining, machine learning (i.e., support vector machine), and stability selection to investigate the unique brain states (functional neural connectivity) that predict the speed of listeners' behavioral decisions. Main results. We infer that (i) the listeners' perceptual speed is directly related to dynamic variations in their brain connectomics, (ii) global network assortativity and efficiency distinguished fast, medium, and slow RTs, (iii) the functional network underlying speeded decisions increases in negative assortativity (i.e., became disassortative) for slower RTs, (iv) slower categorical speech decisions cause excessive use of neural resources and more aberrant information flow within the CP circuitry, (v) slower responders tended to utilize functional brain networks excessively (or inappropriately) whereas fast responders (with lower global efficiency) utilized the same neural pathways but with more restricted organization. Significance. Findings show that neural classifiers (SVM) coupled with stability selection correctly classify behavioral RTs from functional connectivity alone with over 92% accuracy (AUC = 0.9). Our results corroborate previous studies by supporting the engagement of similar temporal (STG), parietal, motor, and prefrontal regions in CP using an entirely data-driven approach.

Decoding locations of attended and unattended moving sound sources using EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Sound; Localization; Motion; Electroencephalography; Cocktail party; Attention	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SPATIAL SENSITIVITY; STREAM SEGREGATION; HUMAN BRAIN; PLANUM TEMPORALE; ATTENTION; REPRESENTATION; MECHANISMS; MOTION; LEVEL	Recently, we showed that in a simple acoustic scene with one sound source, auditory cortex tracks the time-varying location of a continuously moving sound. Specifically, we found that both the delta phase and alpha power of the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to reconstruct the sound source azimuth. However, in natural settings, we are often presented with a mixture of multiple competing sounds and so we must focus our attention on the relevant source in order to segregate it from the competing sources e.g. 'cocktail party effect'. While many studies have examined this phenomenon in the context of sound envelope tracking by the cortex, it is unclear how we process and utilize spatial information in complex acoustic scenes with multiple sound sources. To test this, we created an experiment where subjects listened to two concurrent sound stimuli that were moving within the horizontal plane over headphones while we recorded their EEG. Participants were tasked with paying attention to one of the two presented stimuli. The data were analyzed by deriving linear mappings, temporal response functions (TRF), between EEG data and attended as well unattended sound source trajectories. Next, we used these TRFs to reconstruct both trajectories from previously unseen EEG data. In a first experiment we used noise stimuli and included the task involved spatially localizing embedded targets. Then, in a second experiment, we employed speech stimuli and a non-spatial speech comprehension task. Results showed the trajectory of an attended sound source can be reliably reconstructed from both delta phase and alpha power of EEG even in the presence of distracting stimuli. Moreover, the reconstruction was robust to task and stimulus type. The cortical representation of the unattended source position was below detection level for the noise stimuli, but we observed weak tracking of the unattended source location for the speech stimuli by the delta phase of EEG. In addition, we demonstrated that the trajectory reconstruction method can in principle be used to decode selective attention on a single-trial basis, however, its performance was inferior to envelope-based decoders. These results suggest a possible dissociation of delta phase and alpha power of EEG in the context of sound trajectory tracking. Moreover, the demonstrated ability to localize and determine the attended speaker in complex acoustic environments is particularly relevant for cognitively controlled hearing devices.

Studies were included if they: (1) described a semi-supervised approach to apply machine learning algorithms during data analysis and (2) examined constructs encompassed by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The first two authors reviewed identified articles and recorded study and participant characteristics. The ICF domain used in each study was also identified.Results: After combining information from the eight studies, we established that SSML was a feasible approach for analysis of complex data in rehabilitation research. We also determined that semi-supervised approaches may be more accurate than supervised machine learning approaches.Conclusions: A semi-supervised approach to machine learning has potential to enhance our understanding of complex data sets in rehabilitation science. SSML mirrors the iterative process of rehabilitation, making this approach ideal for calibrating devices, classifying activities or identifying just-in-time interventions. Rehabilitation scientists who are interested in conducting SSML should collaborate with data scientists to advance the application of this approach within our field.Implications for rehabilitationSemi-supervised machine learning applications may be a feasible approach for analyses of complex data sets in rehabilitation research.Semi-supervised machine learning approaches uses a combination of labelled and unlabelled data to produce accurate predictive models, thereby requiring less user-input data than other machine learning approaches (i.e., supervised, unsupervised), reducing resource cost and user-burden.Semi-supervised machine learning is an iterative process that, when applied to rehabilitation assessment and outcomes, could produce accurate personalized models for treatment.Rehabilitation researchers and data scientists should collaborate to implement semi-supervised machine learning approaches in rehabilitation research, optimizing the power of large datasets that are becoming more readily available within the field (e.g., EEG signals, sensors, smarthomes).

Spiking Neural Networks applied to the classification of motor tasks in EEG signals	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Spiking Neural Network; Izhikevich model; EEG signals; Motor imagery; Power Spectral Density; Wavelet Decomposition	SPATIAL-PATTERNS; BCI SYSTEM; IMAGERY; RHYTHM; RECOGNITION; INTERFACE; MU	Motivated by the recent progress of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models in pattern recognition, we report on the development and evaluation of brain signal classifiers based on SNNs. The work shows the capabilities of this type of Spiking Neurons in the recognition of motor imagery tasks from EEG signals and compares their performance with other traditional classifiers commonly used in this application. This work includes two stages: the first stage consists of comparing the performance of the SNN models against some traditional neural network models. The second stage, compares the SNN models performance in two input conditions: input features with constant values and input features with temporal information. The EEG signals employed in this work represent five motor imagery tasks: i.e. rest, left hand, right hand, foot and tongue movements. These EEG signals were obtained from a public database provided by the Technological University of Graz (Brunner et al., 2008). The feature extraction stage was performed by applying two algorithms: power spectral density and wavelet decomposition. Likewise, this work uses raw EEG signals for the second stage of the problem solution. All of the models were evaluated in the classification between two motor imagery tasks. This work demonstrates that with a smaller number of Spiking neurons, simple problems can be solved. Better results are obtained by using patterns with temporal information, thereby exploiting the capabilities of the SNNs. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This synchronization induces a speech-specific, replicable neural phase pattern across trials and enables perceived speech to be classified. In this study, we hypothesized that neural oscillations during articulatory imagination of speech could also synchronize with the rhythm of speech imagery. To validate the hypothesis, after replacing the imagined speech with overt speech due to the physically unobservable nature of imagined speech, we investigated (1) whether the EEG-based regressed speech envelopes correlate with the overt speech envelope and (2) whether EEG during the imagined speech can classify speech stimuli with different envelopes. The variability of the duration of the imagined speech across trials was corrected using dynamic time warping. The classification was based on the distance between a test data and a template waveform of each class. Results showed a significant correlation between the EEG-based regressed envelope and the overt speech envelope. The average classification accuracy was 38.5%, which is significantly above the rate of chance (33.3%). These results demonstrate the synchronization between EEG during the imagined speech and the envelope of the overt counterpart. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

Individual EEG patterns during MI requires subject-dependent feature selection, which is an arduous task due to the complexity and large number of features. One solution is to use metaheuristics, e.g. Genetic Algorithm (GA), to avoid an exhaustive search which is impractical. In this work, one of the most widely used GA, NSGA-II, is used with an hierarchical individual representation to facilitate the exclusion of EEG channels irrelevant for MI. In essence, the performance of different objectives in NSGA-II was evaluated on a previously recorded MI EEG data set. Empirical results show that k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) combined with Pearson's Correlation (PCFS) as objective functions yielded higher classification accuracy as compared to the other objective-combinations (73% vs. 69%). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) combined with Feature Reduction (FR) as objective functions maximized the reduction of features (99.6%) but reduced classification performance (65.6%). All classifier objectives combined with PCFS selected similar features in accordance with expected activity patterns during MI. In conclusion, PCFS and a classifier as objective functions constitutes a good trade-off solution for MI data.

The changes listed above occur due to chemical imbalance in brain. Due to the nature of the disorder, the patients confront the family members about the things they hear and hallucinate. Initially, the family members deny to queries made by patient and later the responses evolve into anger and quarrel. The family members often lack awareness about schizophrenia disorder. Hence, there is a need to diagnose auditory hallucination at early stage. The auditory hallucination alters the EEG signal in ear. EEG sensor is designed and the same place behind the ear lobe to acquire the change in EEG pattern. For study the EEG pattern, acquire for normal and schizophrenia person while watching different videos namely funny video and horror video. The EEG signal acquire during movie watching task and transmit EEG to the base station through wireless sensor network for the wavelet analysis and classification to evaluate the efficiency of data transmission in various routing algorithms such as AODV and DSR and co channel interference of spread spectrum modulation address.

Among many indicators in learners' monitoring, self-efficacy lies at the center of Bandura's social cognitive theory but still remains a significant challenge in setting an effective and reliable evaluation model. Thereby, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based model using electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis, rather than traditional subjective measurement, to evaluate three levels of academic self-efficacy more objectively and precisely. Firstly, we collected academic self-efficacy scales from a cohort of 39 students exposed to three learning tasks of different difficulties and recorded corresponding EEG signals simultaneously. The acquired EEG data were then processed by pass-band filter and baseline drift removal. Subsequently, five features were extracted from the preprocessed EEG data and linked as feature sequences before sending into classifier. Then, using LSTM Recurrent Neural Network as the classification algorithm, we adjusted the number of hidden layers and LSTM units in each layer to observe their influence in performance. Finally, the proposed model achieves the accuracy of 95.06%. We suggest that this model based on LSTM classification and EEG signal analysis promotes a new learners' monitoring pattern for academic self-efficacy evaluation as a physiological data-driven method.

Long-term OSA is associated with cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, arrhythmia and diabetes. Early discovery and treatment of OSA can significantly reduce the difficulty and cost of treatment. OSA detection uses a scale method which is prone to subjective errors. Polysomnography (PSG) requires long detection times, entails equipment which can be difficult to obtain and high cost, and does not provide immediate diagnosis or the establishment of preventative treatment. Human biosignals have been found to provide a faster and more objective means of sleep apnea diagnosis, allowing for the early treatment of OSA. By identifying key physiological characteristics and observing their change over time, one can assess the severity of the patient's condition, and appropriate treatment can reduce the likelihood of disease onset or slow its progression. This study applies machine learning techniques to electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and other complex physiological characteristics to establish a model for OSA severity and evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning methods to detect sleep apnea. In addition, the fuzzy C-mean (FCM) algorithm is used to construct a predictive model for OSA to assist physicians in the early clinical detection of symptoms. The study found that patients with severe sleep apnea have a self-rescue condition which causes wakening due to respiratory arrest. Only relying on SpO(2)and the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) will cause severe OSA cases to be misidentified as mild, and this study found that the A5 band brain wave can help detect sleep apnea, reducing the possibility of miscategorization and assisting physicians in accurate clinical diagnosis.

EEG waves are considered a time series, however most of the literature focus on changing the representation of the waves or working on the data set as a whole. One of the goals of the investigation is reaching a conceptually simplified model so it can be generalized for the new approaches at EEG data acquisition (such as the novel EEG buds). First we mention some of the experiments and approaches that didn't obtain good metrics and then we show the results for MLP and LSTM neural networks. LSTM networks are slower to reach a higher accuracy compared to the MLP networks with less seconds of training, however they are better at reaching stable levels of accuracy when given enough data. Normalization plays an important role on the process, showing that the best and most consistent results are obtained when it is done locally at a sequence level, from where we can infer that the patterns arc arguably most affected by the values (originally measured in micro volts and then normalized) in the local context of the sequence.

The new method is named Blending Hilbert-Kolmogorov (Blending HT-KC) approach. In the Blending HT-KC method, the EEG signal is converted firstly into a complex helical sequence and then into a binary sequence. From the analytic signal, the instantaneous amplitude-based features are obtained and, from the logical signal, the KC features are extracted. The extracted attributes will then fed into the Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM). The proposed approach is examined for four classification problems to distinguish between Ictal (during seizure) and normal states as well as between ictal and interictal (between seizures) states of epilepsy. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance and suitability of the proposed methodology for the detection of seizure activity.

To enhance the sensation of reality, smell has been incorporated into multimedia systems because it can directly stimulate memories and trigger strong emotions. New method: For the recognition of olfactory-induced emotions, this study explored a combination method using a support vector machine (SVM) with an average frequency band division (AFBD) method, where the AFBD method was proposed to extract the power-spectral-density (PSD) features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals induced by smelling different odors. The so-called AFBD method means that each PSD feature was calculated based on equal frequency bandwidths, rather than the traditional EEG rhythm-based bandwidth. Thirteen odors were used to induce olfactory EEGs and their corresponding emotions. These emotions were then divided into two types of emotions, pleasure and disgust, or five types of emotions that were very unpleasant, slightly unpleasant, neutral, slightly pleasant, and very pleasant. Results: Comparison between the proposed SVM plus AFBD method and other methods found average accuracies of 98.9 % and 88.5 % for two- and five-emotion recognition, respectively. These values were considerably higher than those of other combination methods, such as the combinations of AFBD or EEG rhythm-based features with naive Bayesian, k-nearest neighbor classification, voting-extreme learning machine, and backpropagation neural network methods. Conclusions: The SVM plus AFBD method represents a useful contribution to olfactory-induced emotion recognition. Classification of the five-emotion categories was generally inferior to the classification of the twoemotion categories, suggesting that the recognition performance decreased as the number of emotions in the category increased.

Motor Imagery Hand Movement Direction Decoding Using Brain Computer Interface to Aid Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; motor imagery; phase locking value; event-related desynchronization; synchronization; brain-computer interface; neurorehabilitation	EEG	Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is a potential technology for active neurorehabilitation of stroke patients by complementing the conventional passive rehabilitation methods. Research to date mainly focused on classifying left vs. right hand/foot MI of stroke patients. Though a very few studies have reported decoding imagined hand movement directions using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI, the experiments were conducted on healthy subjects. Our work analyzes MI-based brain cortical activity from EEG signals and decodes the imagined hand movement directions in stroke patients. The decoded direction (left vs. right) of hand movement imagination is used to provide control commands to a motorized arm support on which patient's affected (paralyzed) arm is placed. This enables the patient to move his/her stroke-affected hand towards the intended (imagined) direction that aids neuroplasticity in the brain. The synchronization measure called Phase Locking Value (PLV), extracted from EEG, is the neuronal signature used to decode the directional movement of the MI task. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis on Mu and Beta frequency bands of EEG is done to select the time bin corresponding to the MI task. The dissimilarities between the two directions of MI tasks are identified by selecting the most significant channel pairs that provided maximum difference in PLV features. The training protocol has an initial calibration session followed by a feedback session with 50 trials of MI task in each session. The feedback session extracts PLV features corresponding to most significant channel pairs which are identified in the calibration session and is used to predict the direction of MI task in left/right direction. An average MI direction classification accuracy of 74.44% is obtained in performing the training protocol and 68.63% from the prediction protocol during feedback session on 16 stroke patients.

Pilot Study of An Intracranial Electroencephalography Biomarker of Depressive Symptoms in Epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; THETA CORDANCE; EEG POWER; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; DYSFUNCTION; PREDICTION; FREQUENCY; ASYMMETRY	Objectives: Adult patients with epilepsy have an increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD). Intracranial EEG (iEEG) captured during extended inpatient monitoring of patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy offers a particularly promising method to study MDD networks in epilepsy. Methods: The authors used 24 hours of resting-state iEEG to examine the neural activity patterns within corticolimbic structures that reflected the presence of depressive symptoms in 13 adults with medication-refractory epilepsy. Principal component analysis was performed on the z-scored mean relative power in five standard frequency bands averaged across electrodes within a region. Results: Principal component 3 was a statistically significant predictor of the presence of depressive symptoms (R-2 =0.35, p=0.014). A balanced logistic classifier model using principal component 3 alone correctly classified 78% of patients as belonging to the group with a high burden of depressive symptoms or a control group with minimal depressive symptoms (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 80%; area under the curve = 0.8. leave-one-out cross validation). Classification was dependent on beta power throughout the corticolimbic network and low-frequency cingulate power. Conclusions: These finding suggest, for the first time, that neural features across circuits involved in epilepsy may distinguish patients who have depressive symptoms from those who do not. Larger studies are required to validate these findings and to assess their diagnostic utility in MDD.

Here we present a machine-learning-based approach to find evidence for epilepsy in scalp EEGs that do not contain any epileptiform activity, according to expert visual review (i.e., "normal" EEGs). We found that deviations in the EEG features representing brain health, such as the alpha rhythm, can indicate the potential for epilepsy and help lateralize seizure focus, even when commonly recognized epileptiform features are absent. Hence, we developed a machine-learning-based approach that utilizes alpha-rhythm-related features to classify 1) whether an EEG was recorded from an epilepsy patient, and 2) if so, the seizure-generating side of the patient's brain. We evaluated our approach using "normal" scalp EEGs of 48 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and 144 healthy individuals, and a naive Bayes classifier achieved area under ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.81 and 0.72 for the two classification tasks, respectively. These findings suggest that our methodology is useful in the absence of interictal epileptiform activity and can enhance the probability of diagnosing epilepsy at the earliest possible time.

Emotion-Inducing Imagery Versus Motor Imagery for a Brain-Computer Interface	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI; EEG; emotion-inducing imagery; motor imagery; games; neurogaming; assistive technology; machine learning; AI	REAL-TIME CLASSIFICATION; SERIES PREDICTION; ASYMMETRY; SIGNALS; COMMON	Neural correlates of intentionally induced human emotions may offer alternative imagery strategies to control brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this paper, a novel BCI control strategy i.e., imagining fictional or recalling mnemonic sad and happy events, emotion-inducing imagery (EII), is compared to motor imagery (MI) in a study involving multiple sessions using a two-class electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI paradigm with 12 participants. The BCI setup enabled online continuous visual feedback presentation in a game involving one-dimensional control of a game character. MI and EII are compared across different signal-processing frameworks which are based on neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP), filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) and hemispheric asymmetry (ASYM). Online single-trial classification accuracies (CA) results indicate that MI performance across all participants is 77.54% compared to EII performance of 68.78% ( ${p} < 0.05$ ). The results show that an ensemble of the NTSPP, FBCSP and ASYM frameworks maximizes performance for EII with average CA of 71.64% across all participants. Furthermore, the participants' subjective responses indicate that they preferred MI over emotion-inducing imagery (EII) in controlling the game character, and MI was perceived to offer most control over the game character. The results suggest that EII is not a viable alternative to MI for the majority of participants in this study but may be an alternative imagery for a subset of BCI users based on acceptable EII performance (CA >70%) observed for some participants.

Our aims were threefold. First, we sought to establish the sensitivity of two auditory paradigms to elicit neural responses in individual neurotypical children. Second, we aimed to validate the use of a portable and accessible electroencephalography (EEG) system, by comparing its recordings to those of a research-grade system. Third, in light of substantial interindividual variability in individuals' neural responses, we assessed whether multivariate decoding methods could improve sensitivity. Method: We tested the sensitivity of two child-friendly covert N400 paradigms. Thirty-one typically developing children listened to identical spoken words that were either strongly predicted by the preceding context or violated lexical-semantic expectations. Context was given by a cue word (Experiment 1) or sentence frame (Experiment 2), and participants either made an overall judgment on word relatedness or counted lexical-semantic violations. We measured EEG concurrently from a research-grade system, Neuroscan's SynAmps2, and an adapted gaming system, Emotiv's EPOC+. Results: We found substantial interindividual variability in the timing and topology of N400-like effects. For both paradigms and EEG systems, traditional N400 effects at the expected sensors and time points were statistically significant in around 50% of individuals. Using multivariate analyses, detection rate increased to 88% of individuals for the research-grade system in the sentences paradigm, illustrating the robustness of this method in the face of interindividual variations in topography. Conclusions: There was large interindividual variability in neural responses, suggesting interindividual variation in either the cognitive response to lexical-semantic violations and/or the neural substrate of that response. Around half of our neurotypical participants showed the expected N400 effect at the expected location and time points. A low-cost, accessible EEG system provided comparable data for univariate analysis but was not well suited to multivariate decoding. However, multivariate analyses with a research-grade EEG system increased our detection rate to 88% of individuals. This approach provides a strong foundation to establish a neural index of language comprehension in children with limited communication.

Epilepsy may have substantial impacts on the patient's quality of life, and its detection heavily relies on tedious and time-consuming manual curation by experienced clinicians, based on EEG signals. Most existing EEG-based seizure detection algorithms are patient-dependent and train a detection model for each patient. A new patient can only be monitored effectively after several episodes of epileptic seizures. This study investigates the patientindependent detection of seizure events using the open dataset CHB-MIT Scalp EEG. First, a novel feature extraction algorithm called MinMaxHist is proposed to measure the topological patterns of the EEG signals. Following this, MinMaxHist and several other feature extraction algorithms are applied to parameterize the EEG signals. Next, a comprehensive series of feature screening and classification optimization experiments are conducted, and finally, an optimized EEG-based seizure detection model is presented that can achieve overall values for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Kappa of 0.8627, 0.8032, 0.9222, 0.7504 and 0.7254, respectively, with only 30 features. The classification accuracy of the method with MinMaxHist features was 0.0464 higher than that without MinMaxHist features. Compared with existing methods, the proposed algorithm achieved higher accuracy and sensitivity, as shown in the experimental results.

The precise assessment of cognitive and mental workload (MWL) is vital and requires accurate neuroimaging to monitor and evaluate the cognitive states of the brain. In this study, we have decoded four classes of MWL using long short-term memory (LSTM) with 89.31% average accuracy for brain-computer interface (BCI). The brain activity signals are acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) region of the brain. We performed a supervised MWL experimentation with four varying MWL levels on 15 participants (both male and female) and 10 trials of each MWL per participant. Real-time four-level MWL states are assessed using fNIRS system, and initial classification is performed using three strong machine learning (ML) techniques, support vector machine (SVM),k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and artificial neural network (ANN) with obtained average accuracies of 54.33, 54.31, and 69.36%, respectively. In this study, novel deep learning (DL) frameworks are proposed, which utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN) and LSTM with 87.45 and 89.31% average accuracies, respectively, to solve high-dimensional four-level cognitive states classification problem. Statistical analysis,t-test, and one-wayF-test (ANOVA) are also performed on accuracies obtained through ML and DL algorithms. Results show that the proposed DL (LSTM and CNN) algorithms significantly improve classification performance as compared with ML (SVM, ANN, andk-NN) algorithms.

An accurate detection of human emotions is critical to ensure effective interaction and activate proper emotional feedback. In the existing emotion recognition methods, poor generalization capability caused by individual differences in emotion experiences is still a problem. This article proposes a new framework of dynamic entropy-based pattern learning to enable subject-independent emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with good generalization. Firstly, we exploit dynamic entropy measures in quantitative EEG measurement to extract consecutive entropy values from EEG signals over time. Then, based on the concatenation of consecutive entropy values to form feature vectors, the dynamic entropy-based patterning learning can be able to achieve subject-independent emotion recognition across individuals to obtain excellent identification accuracy. Experiment results show that the best average accuracy of 85.11% is reached to identify the negative and positive emotions. Besides, by comparison with the recent researches, the results have fully demonstrated that our method can achieve excellent performance for emotion recognition across individuals. In summary, an universal and subject-independent emotion recognition method with excellent generalization capability is developed by the proposed dynamic entropy-based pattern learning, which may have the great application potential to address the emotion detection in healthcare decision-making and human-computer interaction systems.

Neural Mechanisms of Attentional Control for Objects: Decoding EEG Alpha When Anticipating Faces, Scenes, and Tools	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; attention; decoding; EEG; objects; vision	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA; SYNCHRONIZATION; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS	Attentional selection mechanisms in visual cortex involve changes in oscillatory activity in the EEG alpha band (8-12 Hz), with decreased alpha indicating focal cortical enhancement and increased alpha indicating suppression. This has been observed for spatial selective attention and attention to stimulus features such as color versus motion. We investigated whether attention to objects involves similar alpha-mediated changes in focal cortical excitability. In experiment 1, 20 volunteers (8 males; 12 females) were cued (80% predictive) on a trial-by-trial basis to different objects (faces, scenes, or tools). Support vector machine decoding of alpha power patterns revealed that late (>500 ms latency) in the cue-to-target foreperiod, only EEG alpha differed with the to-be-attended object category. In experiment 2, to eliminate the possibility that decoding of the physical features of cues led to our results, 25 participants (9 males; 16 females) performed a similar task where cues were nonpredictive of the object category. Alpha decoding was now only significant in the early (<200 ms) foreperiod. In experiment 3, to eliminate the possibility that task set differences between the different object categories led to our experiment 1 results, 12 participants (5 males; 7 females) performed a predictive cuing task where the discrimination task for different objects was identical across object categories. The results replicated experiment 1. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the neural mechanisms of visual selective attention involve focal cortical changes in alpha power not only for simple spatial and feature attention, but also for high-level object attention in humans.

EEG is currently a very important tool in the process of epilepsy research. In this paper, a novel noise-insensitive Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system based on interclass competitive learning is proposed for EEG signal recognition. First, a possibilistic clustering in Bayesian framework with interclass competitive learning called PCB-ICL is presented to determine antecedent parameters of fuzzy rules. Inherited by the possibilisticc-means clustering, PCB-ICL is noise insensitive. PCB-ICL learns cluster centers of different classes in a competitive relationship. The obtained clustering centers are attracted by the samples of the same class and also excluded by the samples of other classes and pushed away from the heterogeneous data. PCB-ICL uses the Metropolis-Hastings method to obtain the optimal clustering results in an alternating iterative strategy. Thus, the learned antecedent parameters have high interpretability. To further promote the noise insensitivity of rules, the asymmetric expectile term and Ho-Kashyap procedure are adopted to learn the consequent parameters of rules. Based on the above ideas, a TSK fuzzy system is proposed and is called PCB-ICL-TSK. Comprehensive experiments on real-world EEG data reveal that the proposed fuzzy system achieves the robust and effective performance for EEG signal recognition.

We follow-up a recent machine learning-oriented study that constructed a deep convolutional neural network to automatically identify biological sex from EEG recordings in healthy individuals and highlighted the discriminative role of beta-band power. If generalizing, this finding would be relevant not only theoretically by pointing to some specific neurobiological sexual dimorphisms, but potentially also as a relevant confound in quantitative EEG diagnostic practice. To put this finding to test, we assess whether the automatic identification of biological sex generalizes to another dataset, particularly in the presence of a psychiatric disease, by testing the hypothesis of higher beta power in women compared to men on 134 patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. Moreover, we construct ROC curves and compare the performance of the classifiers in determining sex both before and after the antidepressant treatment. We replicate the observation of a significant difference in beta-band power between men and women, providing classification accuracy of nearly 77%. The difference was consistent across the majority of electrodes, however multivariate classification models did not generally improve the performance. Similar results were observed also after the antidepressant treatment (classification accuracy above 70%), further supporting the robustness of the initial finding.

Adaptive Tunable Q Wavelet Transform-Based Emotion Identification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Adaptive tunable Q wavelet transform (ATQWT); electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; emotions recognition; gray wolf optimization (GWO); multiclass least-squares support vector machine (SVM)	RECOGNITION; MODEL	Emotion is a neuronic transient that drives a person to a certain action. Emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals plays a vital role in the development of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Extracting the important information from raw EEG signals is difficult due to its nonstationary nature. Fixing a factual predefined basis function for efficient decomposition using a tunable Q wavelet transform is an arduous task. In this article, an adaptive tunable Q wavelet transform is proposed for the automatic selection of tuning parameters. Optimum tuning parameters are obtained using gray wolf optimization (GWO). Tuning parameters obtained by GWO are used to decompose the EEG signals into subbands (SBs). The set of time-domain features elicited from the SBs are used as an input to multiclass least-squares support vector machine. Classification accuracy of four basic emotions, namely, happy, fear, sad, and relax, is tested and compared with existing methods. An accuracy of 95.70% is achieved with a radial basis function kernel that is about 5% more than the existing methods using the same data set. This article proposes the development of a nonparameterized decomposition method for efficient decomposition of EEG signals.

Meanwhile, the time when the brain activity associated with the occurring task varies from person to person and trial to trial. Thus, some of the discarded EEG data with time may contain MI-related information. New method: This study proposes a temporal frequency joint sparse optimization and fuzzy fusion (TFSOFF) method for joint frequency band optimization and classification fusion on multiple time windows to effectively utilize the signals of all time period within the MI task. Raw EEG data are first segmented into multiple sublime windows using a sliding window approach. Then, a set of overlapping bandpass filters is performed on each time window to generate a set of overlapping subbands, and common spatial pattern is used for feature extraction at each subband. Joint frequency band optimization is conducted on multiple time windows using a joint sparse optimization model. Fuzzy integral is used to fuse each time window after joint optimization. Results: The proposed TFSOFF is validated on two public EEG datasets and compared with several other competing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed TFSOFF can effectively extract MI related features of all time period EEG signals within the MI task and helps improving the classification performance of MI. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed TFSOFF exhibits superior performance in comparison with several competing methods. Conclusions: The proposed method is a suitable method for improving the performance of MI-based BCIs.

In this study, a style regularized least squares support vector machine based on multikernel learning is proposed and applied to the recognition of epilepsy abnormal signals. The algorithm uses the style conversion matrix to represent the style information contained in the sample, regularizes it in the objective function, optimizes the objective function through the commonly used alternative optimization method, and simultaneously updates the style conversion matrix and classifier during the iteration process parameter. In order to use the learned style information in the prediction process, two new rules are added to the traditional prediction method, and the style conversion matrix is used to standardize the sample style before classification.

While ample neumimaging evidence for such accounts comes from investigations of spatial connectivity, understanding temporal disruptions is important to fully capture the essence of dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. Recent electmphysiology studies suggest that long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in the amplitude dynamics of neural oscillations captures the integrity of transferred information in the healthy brain. Thus, in this study, 25 schizophrenia patients and 25 controls (8 females/group) were recorded during two five-minutes of resting-state magnetoencephalography (once with eyes-open and once with eyes-closed). We used source-level analyses to investigate temporal dysconnectivity in patients by characterizing LRTCs across cortical and sub-cortical brain regions. In addition to standard statistical assessments, we applied a machine learning framework using support vector machine to evaluate the discriminative power of LRTCs in identifying patients from healthy controls. We found that neural oscillations in schizophrenia patients were characterized by reduced signal memory and higher variability across time, as evidenced by cortical and subcortical attenuations of LRTCs in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Support vector machine significantly classified participants using LRTCs in key limbic and paralimbic brain areas, with decoding accuracy reaching 82%. Importantly, these brain regions belong to networks that are highly relevant to the symptomology of schizophrenia. These findings thus posit temporal dysconnectivity as a hallmark of altered information processing in schizophrenia, and help advance our understanding of this pathology.

J	Chen, ZX; Lu, GL; Xie, ZH; Shang, W				Chen, Zixu; Lu, Guoliang; Xie, Zhaohong; Shang, Wei			A Unified Framework and Method for EEG-Based Early Epileptic Seizure Detection and Epilepsy Diagnosis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Seizure detection; epilepsy diagnosis; change detection; one-class SVM; EEG diagnosis	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; TIME; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; MODEL	Electroencephalogram (EEG) contains important physiological information that can reflect the activity of human brain, making it useful for epileptic seizure detection and epilepsy diagnosis. However visual inspection of large amounts of EEG by human expert is time-consuming, and meanwhile there are often inconsistences in judgement between physicians. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for early epileptic seizure detection and epilepsy diagnosis, which includes two phases. In the first phase, the signal intensity is first calculated for each data point of the given EEG, enabling the well-known autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model to characterize the dynamic behavior of the EEG time series. The residual error between the predicted value of learned ARMA model and the actually observed value is used as the anomaly score to support a null hypothesis testing for making epileptic seizure decision. The epileptic seizure detection phase can provide a quick detection for anomaly EEG patterns, but the resulting suspicious segment may include epilepsy or other disordering EEG activities thus required to be identified. Therefore, in the second phase, we use pattern recognition technique to classify the suspicious EEG segments. In particular, we propose a new and practical classifier based on a pairwise of one-class SVMs for epilepsy diagnosis. The proposed classifier requires normal and epilepsy data for training, but can recognize normal, epilepsy and even other disorders that would not be trained in the training samples. This point is practical and meaningful in real clinic scenarios as the input EEG may include other brain disordering diseases besides of epilepsy. We conducted experiments on the publicly-available Bern-Barcelona and CHB-MIT EEG database, respectively, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and our method achieved classification accuracy of 93% and 94% on them. Comprehensive experimental results, outperforming the state-of-the-arts, suggest its great potentials in real applications.

Question Is it possible to predict whether the condition of a patient with depression will improve after escitalopram treatment by analyzing their resting-state electroencephalographic signals? Findings In this prognostic study of data from 122 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder, support vector machine classifiers demonstrated an accuracy of 82.4% for predicting escitalopram treatment outcome. Meaning When complemented by appropriate analysis methods, resting-state electroencephalographic recordings may be instrumental in improving treatment of patients with depression. Importance Social and economic costs of depression are exacerbated by prolonged periods spent identifying treatments that would be effective for a particular patient. Thus, a tool that reliably predicts an individual patient's response to treatment could significantly reduce the burden of depression. Objective To estimate how accurately an outcome of escitalopram treatment can be predicted from electroencephalographic (EEG) data on patients with depression. Design, Setting, and Participants This prognostic study used a support vector machine classifier to predict treatment outcome using data from the first Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND-1) study. The CAN-BIND-1 study comprised 180 patients (aged 18-60 years) diagnosed with major depressive disorder who had completed 8 weeks of treatment. Of this group, 122 patients had EEG data recorded before the treatment; 115 also had EEG data recorded after the first 2 weeks of treatment. Interventions All participants completed 8 weeks of open-label escitalopram (10-20 mg) treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures The ability of EEG data to predict treatment outcome, measured as accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of the classifier at baseline and after the first 2 weeks of treatment. The treatment outcome was defined in terms of change in symptom severity, measured by the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale, before and after 8 weeks of treatment. A patient was designated as a responder if the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale score decreased by at least 50% during the 8 weeks and as a nonresponder if the score decrease was less than 50%. Results Of the 122 participants who completed a baseline EEG recording (mean [SD] age, 36.3 [12.7] years; 76 [62.3%] female), the classifier was able to identify responders with an estimated accuracy of 79.2% (sensitivity, 67.3%; specificity, 91.0%) when using only the baseline EEG data. For a subset of 115 participants who had additional EEG data recorded after the first 2 weeks of treatment, use of these data increased the accuracy to 82.4% (sensitivity, 79.2%; specificity, 85.5%). Conclusions and Relevance These findings demonstrate the potential utility of EEG as a treatment planning tool for escitalopram therapy. Further development of the classification tools presented in this study holds the promise of expediting the search for optimal treatment for each patient.

Recently, there has been a surge of studies with fNIRS for the acquisition, decoding, and regulation of hemodynamic signals to investigate their behavioral consequences for the implementation of brain-machine interfaces (BMI). In this review, first, the existing methods of fNIRS signal processing for decoding brain commands for BMI purposes are reviewed. Second, recent developments, applications, and challenges faced by fNIRS-based BMIs are outlined. Third, current trends in fNIRS in combination with other imaging modalities are summarized. Finally, we propose a feedback control concept for the human brain, in which fNIRS, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging are considered sensors and stimulation techniques are considered actuators in brain therapy.

This nonlinearity and nonstationarity are sometimes introduced in EEG, because of various physiologic and non-physiologic artifacts. To overcome this, the noninvasive EEG data are used to find the functional brain network in missing data of EEG which are obtained after removal of the artifactual motifs. This paper deals with the problem of extracting the functional brain connectivity in missing EEG data that can be used for both data analysis and the classification problem such as brain-computer interface (BCI) implication. Three significant parameters, namely, transitivity, characteristics path length, and centrality are considered from the list of brain functional connectivity metrics. The comparison has been performed between continuous and discontinuous (artifactual motifs removed) data. The results have been shown that the missing data's brain functional connectivity metrics are also following the same pattern of continuous data. The results show the implication of the framework in different brain regions involving in specific relaxation technique of short Kriya Yoga meditation.

Validation of the 2HELPS2B Seizure Risk Score in Acute Brain Injury Patients	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Critical care EEG; Continuous EEG; 2HELPS2B; Seizure; Acute brain injury	NONCONVULSIVE SEIZURES; HEMORRHAGE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PROBABILITY	Background and Objective Seizures are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), subdural hematoma (SDH), and non-traumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH)-collectively defined herein as acute brain injury (ABI). Most seizures in ABI are subclinical, meaning that they are only detectable with EEG. A method is required to identify patients at greatest risk of seizures and thereby in need of prolonged continuous EEG monitoring. 2HELPS2B is a simple point system developed to address this need. 2HELPS2B estimates seizure risk for hospitalized patients using five EEG findings and one clinical finding (pre-EEG seizure). The initial 2HELPS2B study did not specifically assess the ABI subpopulation. In this study, we aim to validate the 2HELPS2B score in ABI and determine its relative predictive accuracy compared to a broader set of clinical and electrographic factors. Methods We queried the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium database for ABI patients age >= 18 with > 6 h of continuous EEG monitoring; data were collected between February 2013 and November 2018. The primary outcome was electrographic seizure. Clinical factors considered were age, coma, encephalopathy, ABI subtype, and acute suspected or confirmed pre-EEG clinical seizure. Electrographic factors included 18 EEG findings. Predictive accuracy was assessed using a machine-learning paradigm with area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve as the primary outcome metric. Three models (clinical factors alone, EEG factors alone, EEG and clinical factors combined) were generated using elastic-net logistic regression. Models were compared to each other and to the 2HELPS2B model. All models were evaluated by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of a ROC analysis and then compared using permutation testing of AUC with bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals. Results A total of 1528 ABI patients were included. Total seizure incidence was 13.9%. Seizure incidence among ABI subtype varied: IPH 17.2%, SDH 19.1%, aSAH 7.6%, TBI 9.2%. Age >= 65 (p = 0.015) and pre-cEEG acute clinical seizure (p < 0.001) positively affected seizure incidence. Clinical factors AUC = 0.65 [95% CI 0.60-0.71], EEG factors AUC = 0.82 [95% CI 0.77-0.87], and EEG and clinical factors combined AUC = 0.84 [95% CI 0.80-0.88]. 2HELPS2B AUC = 0.81 [95% CI 0.76-0.85]. The 2HELPS2B AUC did not differ from EEG factors (p = 0.51), or EEG and clinical factors combined (p = 0.23), but was superior to clinical factors alone (p < 0.001). Conclusions Accurate seizure risk forecasting in ABI requires the assessment of EEG markers of pathologic electro-cerebral activity (e.g., sporadic epileptiform discharges and lateralized periodic discharges). The 2HELPS2B score is a reliable and simple method to quantify these EEG findings and their associated risk of seizure.

Evaluation of a Machine Learning Model Based on Pretreatment Symptoms and Electroencephalographic Features to Predict Outcomes of Antidepressant Treatment in Adults With Depression A Prespecified Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							RATING-SCALE; VENLAFAXINE-XR; EEG; SERTRALINE; ESCITALOPRAM; MEDICATION; VALIDITY	IMPORTANCE Despite the high prevalence and potential outcomes of major depressive disorder, whether and how patients will respond to antidepressant medications is not easily predicted. OBJECTIVE To identify the extent to which a machine learning approach, using gradient-boosted decision trees, can predict acute improvement for individual depressive symptoms with antidepressants based on pretreatment symptom scores and electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prognostic study analyzed data collected as part of the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression, a randomized, prospective open-label trial to identify clinically useful predictors and moderators of response to commonly used first-line antidepressant medications. Data collection was conducted at 20 sites spanning 5 countries and including 518 adult outpatients (18-65 years of age) from primary care or specialty care practices who received a diagnosis of current major depressive disorder between December 1, 2008, and September 30, 2013. Patients were antidepressant medication naive or willing to undergo a 1-week washout period of any nonprotocol antidepressant medication. Statistical analysis was conducted from January 5 to June 30, 2019. EXPOSURES Participants with major depressive disorder were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to undergo 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram oxalate (n = 162), sertraline hydrochloride (n = 176), or extended-release venlafaxine hydrochloride (n = 180). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary objective was to predict improvement in individual symptoms, defined as the difference in score for each of the symptoms on the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression from baseline to week 8, evaluated using the C index. RESULTS The resulting data set contained 518 patients (274 women; mean [SD] age, 39.0 [12.6] years; mean [SD] 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score improvement, 13.0 [7.0]). With the use of 5-fold cross-validation for evaluation, the machine learning model achieved C index scores of 0.8 or higher on 12 of 21 clinician-rated symptoms, with the highest C index score of 0.963 (95% CI, 0.939-1.000) for loss of insight. The importance of any single EEG feature was higher than 5% for prediction of 7 symptoms, with the most important EEG features being the absolute delta band power at the occipital electrode sites (O1, 18.8%; Oz, 6.7%) for loss of insight. Over and above the use of baseline symptom scores alone, the use of both EEG and baseline symptom features was associated with a significant increase in the C index for improvement in 4 symptoms: loss of insight (C index increase, 0.012 [95% CI, 0.001-0.020]), energy loss (C index increase, 0.035 [95% CI, 0.011-0.059]), appetite changes (C index increase, 0.017 [95% CI, 0.003-0.030]), and psychomotor retardation (C index increase, 0.020 [95% CI, 0.008-0.032]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that machine learning may be used to identify independent associations of symptoms and EEG features to predict antidepressant-associated improvements in specific symptoms of depression. The approach should next be prospectively validated in clinical trials and settings. This prognostic study examines the extent to which a machine learning approach, using gradient-boosted decision trees, can predict acute improvement in individual depressive symptoms with antidepressants based on pretreatment symptom scores and electroencephalographic measures. Question Can machine learning models predict improvement of various depressive symptoms with antidepressant treatment based on pretreatment symptom scores and electroencephalographic measures? Findings In this prognostic study, using the machine learning approach of gradient-boosted decision trees, the ElecTreeScore algorithm could reliably distinguish the patients who responded to treatment from those who did not based on various depressive symptoms using pretreatment symptom scores and electroencephalographic features (using the cross-validation approach on 518 patients). Meaning Machine learning approaches that include pretreatment symptom scores and electroencephalographic features may help predict which depressive symptoms will improve with antidepressants.

Historically the classification of EEG into physiological, pathological, or artifacts has been performed by expert visual review of the recordings. However, the size of EEG data recordings is rapidly increasing with a trend for higher channel counts, greater sampling frequency, and longer recording duration and complete reliance on visual data review is not sustainable. In this study, we publicly share annotated intracranial EEG data clips from two institutions: Mayo Clinic, MN, USA and St. Anne's University Hospital Brno, Czech Republic. The dataset contains intracranial EEG that are labeled into three groups: physiological activity, pathological/epileptic activity, and artifactual signals. The dataset published here should support and facilitate training of generalized machine learning and digital signal processing methods for intracranial EEG and promote research reproducibility. Along with the data, we also propose a statistical method that is recommended for comparison of candidate classifier performance utilizing out-of-institution/out-of-patient testing.

Neural activity produced within localized brain networks has been associated with the process that integrates both sensory bottom-up and cognitive top-down information processing. Yet, how specifically the different types and components of neural responses reflect the local networks' selectivity for categorical information processing is still unknown. In this work we train Random Forest classification models to decode eight perceptual categories from broad spectrum of human intracranial signals (4-150Hz, 100 subjects) obtained during a visual perception task. We then analyze which of the spectral features the algorithm deemed relevant to the perceptual decoding and gain the insights into which parts of the recorded activity are actually characteristic of the visual categorization process in the human brain. We show that network selectivity for a single or multiple categories in sensory and non-sensory cortices is related to specific patterns of power increases and decreases in both low (4-50Hz) and high (50-150Hz) frequency bands. By focusing on task-relevant neural activity and separating it into dissociated anatomical and spectrotemporal groups we uncover spectral signatures that characterize neural mechanisms of visual category perception in human brain that have not yet been reported in the literature.

J	Li, F; He, F; Wang, F; Zhang, DY; Xia, Y; Li, XY				Li, Feng; He, Fan; Wang, Fei; Zhang, Dengyong; Xia, Yi; Li, Xiaoyu			A Novel Simplified Convolutional Neural Network Classification Algorithm of Motor Imagery EEG Signals Based on Deep Learning	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						motor imagery (MI); electroencephalogram (EEG); simplified convolutional neural network (SCNN); continuous wavelet transform (CWT)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION; BCI	Left and right hand motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) signals are widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems to identify a participant intent in controlling external devices. However, due to a series of reasons, including low signal-to-noise ratios, there are great challenges for efficient motor imagery classification. The recognition of left and right hand MI-EEG signals is vital for the application of BCI systems. Recently, the method of deep learning has been successfully applied in pattern recognition and other fields. However, there are few effective deep learning algorithms applied to BCI systems, particularly for MI based BCI. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that combines continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and a simplified convolutional neural network (SCNN) to improve the recognition rate of MI-EEG signals. Using the CWT, the MI-EEG signals are mapped to time-frequency image signals. Then the image signals are input into the SCNN to extract the features and classify them. Tested by the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b, the experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the nine subjects is 83.2%, and the mean kappa value is 0.651, which is 11.9% higher than that of the champion in the BCI Competition IV. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed CWT-SCNN algorithm has a better classification performance and a shorter training time. Therefore, this algorithm could enhance the classification performance of MI based BCI and be applied in real-time BCI systems for use by disabled people.

This comes with substantial challenges, such as having to remove artifacts in order to extract reliable features, especially when using electroencephalography (EEG). Some approaches have been described in the literature to address online artifact correction. However, none are being used as a 'gold-standard' method, and no research has been conducted to analyze and compare their respective effects on statistical data analysis (inference-based decision). Objective. In this paper, we evaluate methods for artifact correction and describe the necessary adjustments to implement them for online EEG data analysis. Approach. We investigate the following methods: artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR), fully online and automated artifact removal for brain-computer interfacing (FORCe), online empirical model decomposition (EMD), and online independent component analysis. For assessment, we simulated online data processing using real data from an auditory oddball task. We compared the above methods with classical offline data processing, in their ability (i) to reveal a significant mismatch negativity (MMN) response to auditory stimuli; (ii) to reveal the more subtle modulation of the MMN by contextual changes (namely, the predictability of the sound sequence), and (iii) to identify the most likely learning process that explains the MMN response. Main results. Our results show that ASR and EMD are both able to reveal a significant MMN and its modulation by predictability, and even appear more sensitive than the offline analysis when comparing alternative models of perception underlying auditory evoked responses. Significance. ASR and EMD show many advantages when compared to other online artifact correction methods. Besides, subtle modulation analysis of the MMN, embedded in perception computational models is a novel method for assessing the quality of artifact correction methods.

Automated diagnosis of epilepsy from EEG signals using ensemble learning approach	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Classification; EEG signal; Entropy; Epilepsy; Higher order spectra	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; WAVELET TRANSFORM; IDENTIFICATION; QUANTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION	Epilepsy is generally considered as a collection of neurological disorders manifested by epileptic seizures. It is often confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG signals are non stationary, nonlinear and non Gaussian. In this paper, in order to tackle this problem, we have used three different methods for feature extraction namely wavelet based entropy (approximation entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy), nonlinear features (Hurst exponent, Higuchi Fractal Dimension) and higher order spectra (mean, normalized entropy-1 and normalized entropy-2). Further multiclass classification using indirect approach with One vs One method is employed using heterogenous ensemble learning approach. Entropy features are used for classifying normal and interictal class using k-Nearest Neighbor. Higher Order Spectra features are used for classifying normal and ictal class using Support Vector Machine with Radial basis function as kernel and non linear features are used for classifying interictal and ictal class using Naive Bayes. Final verdict is taken by meta classifier with meta learning algorithm Stacking Correspondence Analysis and Nearest Neighbor (SCANN). The proposed method surpasses the existing methods in literature in terms of sensitivity and specificity. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moreover, SCZ-the disease entity is very heterogeneous. Supervised-Machine-Learning (sML) application of Artificial-Intelligence holds a tremendous promise in solving these issues. Aims: To sML-based discriminating validity of resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) quantitative features in classifying SCZ from healthy and, positive (PS) and negative symptom (NS) subgroups, using a high-density recording. Settings and Design: Data collected at a tertiary care mental-health institute using a cross-sectional study design and analyzed at a premier Engineering Institute. Materials and Methods: Data of 38-SCZ patients and 20-healthy controls were retrieved. The positive-negative subgroup classification was done using Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale operational-criteria. EEG was recorded using 256-channel high-density equipment. Eight priori regions-of-interest were selected. Six-level wavelet decomposition and Kernel-Support Vector Machine (SVM) method were used for feature extraction and data classification. Statistical Analysis: Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of machine learning-features. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristics-curve were measured as discriminatory indices of classifications. Results: Accuracy of classifying SCZ from healthy and PS from NS SCZ, were 78.95% and 89.29%, respectively. While beta and gamma frequency related features most accurately classified SCZ from healthy controls, delta and theta frequency related features most accurately classified positive from negative SCZ. Inferior frontal gyrus features most accurately contributed to both the classificatory instances. Conclusions: SVM-based classification and sub-classification of SCZ using EEG data is optimal and might help in improving the "validity" and reducing the "heterogeneity" in the diagnosis of SCZ. These results might only be generalized to acute and moderately ill male SCZ patients.

It is a dynamic state in learning and practicing movement tracking when a person mentally imitates physical activity. Recently, it has been determined that a brain-computer interface (BCI) can support this kind of neurological rehabilitation or mental practice of action. In this context, MI data have been captured via non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEGs), and EEG-based BCIs are expected to become clinically and recreationally ground-breaking technology. However, determining a set of efficient and relevant features for the classification step was a challenge. In this paper, we specifically focus on feature extraction, feature selection, and classification strategies based on MI-EEG data. In an MI-based BCI domain, covariance metrics can play important roles in extracting discriminatory features from EEG datasets. To explore efficient and discriminatory features for the enhancement of MI classification, we introduced a median absolute deviation (MAD) strategy that calculates the average sample covariance matrices (SCMs) to select optimal accurate reference metrics in a tangent space mapping (TSM)-based MI-EEG. Furthermore, all data from SCM were projected using TSM according to the reference matrix that represents the featured vector. To increase performance, we reduced the dimensions and selected an optimum number of features using principal component analysis (PCA) along with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) that could classify MI tasks. Then, the selected features were used to develop linear discriminant analysis (LDA) training for classification. The benchmark datasets were considered for the evaluation and the results show that it provides better accuracy than more sophisticated methods.

However, it is often always misused when individuals attempt an insurance fraud claim by providing false medical conditions. Therefore, there is a need for an instant brain condition classification system. This study presents a novel classification architecture that can classify non-severe TBI patients and healthy subjects employing resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) as the input, solving the immobility issue of the computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The proposed architecture makes use of long short term memory (LSTM) and error-correcting output coding support vector machine (ECOC-SVM) to perform multiclass classification. The pre-processed EEG time series are supplied to the network by each time step, where important information from the previous time step will be remembered by the LSTM cell. Activations from the LSTM cell is used to train an ECOC-SVM. The temporal advantages of the EEG were amplified and able to achieve a classification accuracy of 100%. The proposed method was compared to existing works in the literature, and it is shown that the proposed method is superior in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.

We therefore assessed if there are differences between characteristics of the ictal onset when we are likely to have a true onset, and characteristics of the discharge in regions of spread. Methods: Wavelet based statistical features were extracted in 503 onset and 390 spread channels of 58 seizures from 20 patients. These features were used as predictors in models based on machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, random and rotation forest. Results: Statistical features (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) associated with all wavelet scales were significantly higher in onset than in spread channels. The best classifier, random forest, achieved accuracy of 79.6% and precision of 82%. Conclusions: The signals associated with onset and spread regions exhibit different characteristics. The proposed features are able to classify the signals with good accuracy. Significance: Using our classifier on new seizures could help clinicians gain confidence in having recorded the real seizure onset or on the contrary be concerned that the true onset may have been missed.

Major disadvantages in implementing such systems are the bulky design and system cost. This study implements a simple multifunction BCI system for the environment control and exigency assistance by just using single channel Electroencephalogram (EEG). In the proposed model, the environment is controlled through Internet of Things (IoT) as per individual's cognitive state while for exigency assistance served as per Event Related Potential (ERP) observed during oddball paradigm. Arduino microcontroller (AMC) hardware is designed for controlling environment. Different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms observed for training the classifiers. Weighted k-Nearest Neighbour (Wk-NN) algorithm trained classifier delivers the best result, with accuracy of 98.3% to detect ERP and 95% accuracy for cognitive state detection.

BCIs can serve as a means of communication and for the restoration of motor function for patients with motor disorders. An essential part of the design of a BCI is correctly classifying the brain signals, historically collected using electroen-cephalography (EEG). However, recent studies have shown more robust classification results when EEG is combined with other neuroimaging methods such as fNIRS. Conventional classification methods need a priori feature preprocessing to train the model; such feature selection is a difficult and heavily studied problem. By using deep neural networks (DNN), in which recordings can be fed directly to the algorithm for training, we avoid the need for feature selection. In this study, the capabilities of DNNs in the classification of the hybrid EEG-fNIRS recordings of motor imagery (MI) and mental workload (MWL) tasks are investigated. A five-layer fully connected network is used for classification. This study makes use of two open-source meta-datasets collected at the Technische Universitat Berlin. The first dataset includes brain activity recordings of 26 healthy participants during three cognitive tasks: (1) n-back (0-, 2- and 3-back), (2) discrimination/selection response task (DSR) and (3) word generation (WG) tasks. The second dataset, motor imagery, consists of left and right-hand motor imagery tasks, each for 29 healthy participants. Our results show that classification accuracy is considerably higher for multimodal recordings when compared to EEG or fNIRS recordings alone. The proposed algorithm improves classification performance relative to a conventional support vector machine (SVM), reaching 90% average accuracy for both tasks, 8% higher than SVM performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving strong classification performance using multimodal BCI and deep learning.

Due to their high signal-to-noise ratio, steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) has been widely used to build BCIs. However, currently developed algorithms do not predict the modulation of SSVEP amplitude, which is known to change as a function of stimulus luminance contrast. In this study, we aim to develop an integrated approach to simultaneously estimate the frequency and contrast-related amplitude modulations of the SSVEP signal. To achieve that, we developed a behavioral task in which human participants focused on a visual flicking target which the luminance contrast can change through time in several ways. SSVEP signals from 16 subjects were then recorded from electrodes placed at the central occipital site using a low-cost, consumer-grade EEG. Our results demonstrate that the filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) performed well in SSVEP frequency recognition, while the support vector regression (SVR) outperformed the other supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting the contrast-dependent amplitude modulations of the SSVEPs. These findings indicate the applicability and strong performance of our integrated method at simultaneously predicting both frequency and amplitude of visually evoked signals, and have proven to be useful for advancing SSVEP-based applications.

Most of the existing work focuses on the subject-dependent classification that applies power spectrum density (PSD) features. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral-spatial (S-S) model for cross-subject fatigue-related SA recognition. The S-S model not only considers the biological topology across different brain regions to capture both local and global relations among different EEG channels, but also extracts spectral features for each EEG channel. Specifically, we firstly model the topological structure of EEG channels via an adjacency matrix which is built based on the Euclidean distance between EEG channels. Then, the graph convolution operation is employed to perform the neighbourhood aggregation for extracting spatial features. We test our model on a public dataset collected during driver's task performance. The subject-independent performance of the model is explored. Results demonstrate (1) the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art models on SA recognition from EEG signals. Specifically, our S-S model achieves 70.6% accuracy which is higher than traditional machine learning methods by 2.7%-6.8% and deep learning methods by 10.3%-11.6%; (2) EEG signal at the occipital region can better reflect the change of SA.

However, current BCI systems could only implement a small number of command codes, which hampers their applicability. Methods: This study developed a high-speed hybrid BCI system containing as many as 108 instructions, which were encoded by concurrent P300 and steadystate visual evoked potential (SSVEP) features and decoded by an ensemble task-related component analysis method. Notably, besides the frequency-phase-modulated SSVEP and time-modulated P300 features as contained in the traditional hybrid P300 and SSVEP features, this study found two new distinct EEG features for the concurrent P300 and SSVEP features, i.e., time-modulated SSVEP and frequency-phase- modulated P300. Ten subjects spelled in both offline and online cued-guided spelling experiments. Other ten subjects took part in online copy-spelling experiments. Results: Offline analyses demonstrate that the concurrent P300 and SSVEP features can provide adequate classification information to correctly select the target from 108 characters in 1.7 seconds. Online cued-guided spelling and copy-spelling tests further show that the proposed BCI system can reach an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 172.46 +/- 32.91 bits/min and 164.69 +/- 33.32 bits/min respectively, with a peak value of 238.41 bits/min (The demo video of online copy-spelling can be found at https:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW2Q08oHSBo). Conclusion: We expand a BCI instruction set to over 100 command codes with high-speed in an efficient manner, which significantly improves the degree of freedom of BCIs. Significance: This study hold promise for broadening the applications of BCI systems.

In this context, so far mainly linear models have been used. However, the decoding performance of the linear model is limited due to the complex and highly non-linear nature of the auditory processing in the human brain. We present a novel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based architecture as a nonlinear model for the classification problem of whether a given pair of (EEG, speech envelope) correspond to each other or not. The model maps short segments of the EEG and the envelope to a common embedding space using a CNN in the EEG path and an LSTM in the speech path. The latter also compensates for the brain response delay. In addition, we use transfer learning to fine-tune the model for each subject. The mean classification accuracy of the proposed model reaches 85%, which is significantly higher than that of a state of the art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model (73%) and the linear model (69%).

Although the methods of brain network analysis have been widely studied in the BCI field, these methods are limited by differences in network size, density, and standardization. To address this issue and improve classification accuracy, we propose a novel method, in which the hybrid features of the brain function based on the bilevel network are extracted. Minimum spanning tree (MST) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signal nodes in different MIs is constructed as the first network layer to solve the global network connectivity problem. In addition, the regional network in different movement patterns is constructed as the second network layer to determine the network characteristics, which is consistent with the correspondence between limb movement patterns and cerebral cortex in neurophysiology. We attempt to apply MST to the classification of the MI EEG signals, and the bilevel network has better interpretability. Thereafter, a vector is formed by combining the MST fundamental features with the directional features of the regional network. Our method is validated using the BCI Competition IV Dataset I. Experimental results verify the feasibility of the bilevel network framework. Furthermore, the average classification performance of the proposed method reaches 89.50%, which is higher than that of other competing methods, thereby indicating that the bilevel network is effective for MI classification.

In such cases, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) such as the P300 speller use electroencephalography (EEG) to capture subject brain signals which are decoded to provide an alternate channel for communication. This paper develops new and sophisticated BCI techniques combining language models, probabilistic flashboard design, and optimal scanning techniques which together with smoothing algorithms and word suggestions can be effectively utilized as a form of predictive spelling. Detailed offline simulations based on subject EEG data allowed for testing a variety of methods on a large subject population producing extensive output text including both in vocabulary and out of vocabulary words. Significant performance gains were seen when applying language models to classification and optimizing the interface for stimulus presentation. The results demonstrate that feed-forward techniques with appropriate flashboard design and word completion algorithms can achieve similar or better performance as more complex feedback schemes. Consequently, one can employ lower complexity flashboard as well as control and yet achieve the performance gains offered by more complex techniques	[Parthasarathy, Nithin; Arnold, Corey; Speier, William] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Radiol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Pouratian, Nader] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurosurg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA		Parthasarathy, N (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Radiol Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.	nithinparthasarthy@gmail.com; cwarnold@ucla.edu; NPouratian@mednet.ucla.edu; speier@ucla.edu							17	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2471-7819		978-1-7281-9574-2	IEEE INT C BIOINF BI			2020							807	812		10.1109/BIBE50027.2020.00137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BIBE50027.2020.00137			6	Engineering, Biomedical; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Medical Informatics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Medical Informatics	BR6AO					2022-08-02	WOS:000659298300129

How the human brain solves this non-trivial task is a challenge that the scientific community has not yet found answers to. In recent years, progress has been made thanks to the development of system identification method based on least-squares (LS) that maps the variations between the cortical signals of a listener and the speech signals present in an auditory scene. Results from numerous two-speaker experiments simulating the cocktail party effect have shown that the auditory attention could be inferred from electroencephalography (EEG) using the LS method. It has been suggested that these methods have the potential to be integrated into hearing aids for algorithmic control. However, a major challenge remains using LS methods such that a large number of scalp EEG electrodes are required in order to get a reliable estimate of the attention. Here we present a new system identification method based on linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) that could estimate the attention with the help of two electrodes: one for the true signal estimation and other for the noise estimation. The algorithm is tested using EEG signals collected from ten subjects and its performance is compared against the state-ofthe-art LS algorithm.

In this survey, connectivity analysis was applied, since it can provide information flow of brain regions; moreover, lying and truth appear to be cohered with the flow of information in the brain. Initially, a new wavelet-based approach for EEG/PPG effective connectivity fusion was introduced; then, it was validated for 41 subjects. For each subject, after extracting specific wavelet component of EEG and PPG signals, an effective connectivity network was generated by a generalized partial direct coherence and a direct directed transfer function. The results showed that grand average connectivity patterns were different in some regions for guilty and innocent subjects. The classification results demonstrated that lying could be discriminated from truth with the average accuracy of 84.14% by the leave-one-subject-out method. The present results contribute new information about coupling between EEG and PPG signals.

No human intervention is needed in the analysis process. This is the state of the art results for automatic identification of Dyslexic readers using a Lexical Decision Task. We use mathematical and machine learning based techniques to automatically discover novel complex features that (i) allow for reliable distinction between Dyslexic and Normal Control Skilled readers and (ii) to validate the assumption that most of the differences between Dyslexic and Skilled readers are located in the left hemisphere. Interestingly, these tools also pointed to the fact that High Pass signals (typically considered as "noise" during ERP/EEG analyses) in fact contain significant relevant information. Finally, the proposed scheme can be used for analysis of any ERP based studies.

Manual classification of these groups is sometimes difficult, especially, when no clinical record is available, thus presenting a need for an algorithm for automatic classification. The presented algorithm has the following steps: (i) EEG spike detection by morphological filter based algorithm; (ii) classification of EEG spikes using preprocessed EEG signal data from all channels in the vicinity of the spike detected; (iii) majority rule classifier application to all EEG spikes from a single patient. Classification based on majority rule allows us to achieve 80% average accuracy (despite the fact that from a single spike one would obtain only 58% accuracy).

However, the number of trials for a given subject is usually less. Under this situation, the performance of motor imagery task classification may degrade. In this research work, we propose a combination of graph theoretic spectral method and quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) to obtain a subset of relevant and non-redundant electrodes for effective motor imagery task classification. Stationary Common Spatial Pattern method, which can handle non-stationarity issue, is used for extraction of features from the reduced set of electrodes. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier. Improvement in classification performance on publicly available dataset signifies efficacy of the proposed method. Friedman statistical test demonstrates that the performance of the proposed method is significantly better in comparison to existing CSP and its variants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Given the known heterogeneity within the autistic population, it is crucial to design tests of semantic comprehension that are sensitive in individuals. Recent efforts to develop neural signals of language comprehension have focused on the N400, a robust marker of lexical-semantic violation at the group level. However, homogeneity of response in individual neurotypical children has not been established. Here, we presented 20 neurotypical children with congruent and incongruent visual animations and spoken sentences while measuring their neural response using electroencephalography (EEG). Despite robust group-level responses, we found high inter-individual variability in response to lexico-semantic anomalies. To overcome this, we analysed our data using temporally and spatially unconstrained multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA), supplemented by descriptive analyses to examine the timecourse, topography, and strength of the effect. Our results show that neurotypical children exhibit heterogenous responses to lexical-semantic violation, implying that any application to heterogenous disorders such as autism spectrum disorder will require individual-subject analyses that are robust to variation in topology and timecourse of neural responses.

Here, we introduce a methodological framework for delineating the subset of sensors, the covariance structure of which offers a reduced, but more powerful, representation of brain's coordination patterns that ultimately leads to reliable mind reading. Methods: Adopting a Riemannian geometry approach, we turn the problem of sensor selection as a maximization of a functional that is computed over the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and encapsulates class separability in a way that facilitates the search among subsets of different size. The introduced optimization task, namely discriminative covariance reduction (DCR), lacks an analytical solution and is tackled via the cross-entropy optimization technique. Results: Based on two different EEG datasets and three distinct classification schemes, we demonstrate that the DCR approach provides a noteworthy gain in terms of accuracy (in some cases exceeding 20%) and a remarkable reduction in classification time (on average 82%). Additionally, results include the intriguing empirical finding that the pattern of selected sensors in the case of disabled persons depends on the type of disability. Conclusion: The proposed DCR framework can speed up the classification time in BCI-systems operating on the SPD manifolds by simultaneously enhancing their reliability. This is achieved without sacrificing the neuroscientific interpretability endowed in the topographical arrangement of the selected sensors. Significance: Riemannian geometry is exploited for DCR in BCI systems, in a dimensionality-agnostic manner, guaranteeing improved performance.

To achieve this goal, scalp EEG data were recorded from 32 subjects under cold stimuli conditions. The proposed DFB-based ConvNets model is capable of classifying three classes of tonic pain: No pain, Moderate Pain, and Severe Pain. Firstly, the proposed method utilizes diverse frequency band-based inputs to learn temporal representations from different frequency bands of Electroencephalogram (EEG) which are expected to have more discriminative power. Then the derived features are concatenated to form a feature vector, which is fed into a fully-connected network for performing the classification task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully discriminates the tonic cold pain states. To show the superiority of the DFB-based ConvNets classifier, we compare our results with the state-of-the-art classifiers and show it has a competitive classification accuracy (97.37%). Moreover, these promising results may pave the way to use DFB-based ConvNets in clinical pain research. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper presents a framework for overcoming EEG uncertainties in real-time multiclass MI BCI. An artifact rejected multiclass extension of common spatial pattern (CSP) by using joint approximate diagonalization (JAD) is proposed for feature extraction. Artifactual trials are excluded in spatial filters calculation that results in more informative features. In order to cope with non-stationarities, an adaptive resonance theory (ART) based neuro-fuzzy classifier, named self-regulated supervised Gaussian fuzzy adaptive system Art (SRSG-FasArt) is implemented for multiclass applications. The proposed framework is evaluated based on a standard dataset of BCI competition IV. Applying the system in real-time performance shows significant improvement in multiclass classification accuracy compared to state of the art methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, performance variations across individuals have limited their use to laboratory environments. Handedness could contribute to these variations, especially when motor imagery (MI) tasks are used for BCI control. To further understand how handedness affects BCI control, performance differences between two monozygotic twins were analysed during offline movement and MI tasks, and while twins controlled a BCI using right-hand MI. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), brain structures' volumes, and neuropsychological tests were assessed to evaluate physiological, anatomical and psychological relationships with BCI performance. Results showed that both twins had good motor imagery and attention abilities, similar volumes on most subcortical brain structures, more pronounced event-related desynchronization elicited by the twin performing non-dominant MI, and that this twin also obtained significant higher performances with the BCI. Linear regression analysis implied a strong association between twins' BCI performance, and more pronounced cortical activations in the contralateral hemisphere relative to hand MI. Therefore, it is possible that BCI performance was related with the ability of each twin to elicit cortical activations during hand MI, and less associated with subcortical brain structures' volumes and neuropsychological tests.

The channel selection method helps to remove task-independent EEG signals, thereby improving the performance of the BCI system. However, the brain regions associated with motor imagery in different subjects are not exactly same, and the method of channel selection depends on the feedback of classification results. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposed a new method of channel selection based on backward elimination and threshold. First, we calculated the variance of channels between categories based on the covariance matrix. The backward selection and threshold selection methods were then used to retain the highly differentiated channels. We also used different criterion to evaluate the discriminability between different classes. The selected EEG signals used common spatial pattern (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM) to calculate the classification accuracy. The efficacy of the proposed approach was examined using three data sets. The proposed approach has achieved 77.82% accuracy on the BCI Competition IV data set IIa, 86.02% accuracy on the BCI Competition III data set IIIa, and 86.86% accuracy on the binary class BCI Competition III data set IVa. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with other existing algorithms. The results of our experiments demonstrated that the proposed algorithm produces a higher classification accuracy compared to the other algorithms using lesser number of channels.

It encourages the patient to imagine the affected side of motor motion based on plasticity of brain nerve. Motor imagery plays an indispensable role on stroke rehabilitation for its benefit to the reconstruction of brain's damaged nerve. In order to further improve the classification accuracy and reliability, enhance patients' confidence in treatment, at the same time, it also provides more accurate feedback for the online training part of the follow-up rehabilitation system. SVM. KNN (k-nearest neighbor) and LDA (linear discrimination analysis) are used to classify EEG data. For each sampling data, three classification methods are used, each classification method produces a corresponding classification result, and the final classification result is determined by voting mechanism.

For instance, despite the importance of rapidly decoding fearful faces, this expression often is confused with other expressions, such as Surprise in explicit behavioral categorization tasks. We quantified implicit visual discrimination among rapidly presented facial expressions with an oddball periodic visual stimulation approach combined with electroencephalography (EEG), testing for the relationship with behavioral explicit measures of facial emotion discrimination. We report robust facial expression discrimination responses bilaterally over the occipito-temporal cortex for each pairwise expression change. While fearful faces presented as repeated stimuli led to the smallest deviant responses from all other basic expressions, deviant fearful faces were well discriminated overall and to a larger extent than expressions of Sadness and Anger. Expressions of Happiness did not differ quantitatively as much in EEG as for behavioral subjective judgments, suggesting that the clear dissociation between happy and other expressions, typically observed in behavioral studies, reflects higher-order processes. However, this expression differed from all others in terms of scalp topography, pointing to a qualitative rather than quantitative difference. Despite this difference, overall, we report for the first time a tight relationship of the similarity matrices across facial expressions obtained for implicit EEG responses and behavioral explicit measures collected under the same temporal constraints, paving the way for new approaches of understanding facial expression discrimination in developmental, intercultural, and clinical populations.

J	Nguyen, HAT; Le, TH; Bui, TD				Nguyen, Hoang-Anh The; Le, Thanh Ha; Bui, The Duy			A deep wavelet sparse autoencoder method for online and automatic electrooculographical artifact removal	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; EOG artifact; Deep wavelet sparse autoencoder	OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EOG ARTIFACTS; EEG; SEPARATION	Electrooculographical (EOG) artifacts are problematic to electroencephalographical (EEG) signal analysis and degrade performance of brain-computer interfaces. A novel, robust deep wavelet sparse autoencoder (DWSAE) method is presented and validated for fully automated EOG artifact removal. DWSAE takes advantage of wavelet transform and sparse autoencoder to become a universal EOG artifact corrector. After being trained without supervision, the sparse autoencoder performs EOG correction on time-frequency coefficients collected after brain wave signal wavelet decomposition. Corrected coefficients are then used for wavelet reconstruction of uncontaminated EEG signals. DWSAE is compared with five other methods: second-order blind identification, information maximization, joint approximation diagonalization of eigen-matrices, wavelet neural network (WNN) and wavelet thresholding (WT). Experimental results on a visual attention task dataset, a mental state recognition dataset and a semi-simulated contaminated EEG dataset show that DWSAE is capable of suppressing EOG artifacts effectively, while preserving the nature of background EEG signals. The mean square error of signals before and after correction by DWSAE on a semi-simulated contaminated EEG segment of 30 s is the lowest (65.62) when compared to the results produced by WNN and WT. DWSAE addresses limitations posed by these methods in three ways. First, DWSAE can be performed automatically and online in a single channel of EEG data; this has advantages over independent component analysis-based methods. Second, its results are robust and stable in comparison with those of other wavelet-based methods. Third, as an unsupervised learning scheme, DWSAE does not require the off-line training that is necessary for WNN and other supervised learning machine learning-based methods.

Orientation-dependency of perceptual surround suppression and orientation decoding of centre-surround stimuli are preserved with healthy ageing	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Orientation; Multivariate decoding; Surround suppression; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Ageing	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; PERCEIVED CONTRAST; PSYCHOPHYSICS; DEGRADATION; SELECTIVITY; MODULATION; PATTERNS; FOVEAL; EEG	A key visual neuronal property that is mirrored in human behaviour is centre-surround contrast suppression, which is orientation-dependent. When a target is embedded in a high-contrast surround, the centre appears reduced in contrast, the magnitude of which depends on the relative orientation between centre and surround. Previous reports demonstrate changes in perceptual surround suppression with ageing; however, whether the orientation-dependency of surround suppression is impacted by ageing has not been explored. Here, we tested 18 younger (aged 19-33) and 18 older (aged 60-77) adults. Perceptual surround suppression was stronger for parallel than orthogonal stimuli; however contrary to previous work, here we found no difference in perceptual suppression strength between age-groups. In the same participants, we measured event-related potentials (ERPs) and conducted multivariate pattern analysis to confirm that parallel and orthogonal centre-surround stimuli elicit distinguishable brain activity, predominantly over occipital areas. Despite a delay in the first prominent ERP component (P1) in response to each pattern, older adults showed similar decoding of orientation information (i.e. distinguish between parallel and orthogonal centre-surround stimuli from 70 ms post-stimulus onset) as younger adults. This suggests that sufficient information to distinguish orientation in centre-surround stimuli becomes available to the older human brain as early as in younger adults.

These are essential components for body protection as well as for restoring the sense of embodiment. Notwithstanding the considerable advances that have been made in designing suitable sensors and restoring tactile perceptions, pain perception dynamics and its decoding using effective bio-markers, are still not fully understood. Here, using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, we identified and validated a spatio-temporal signature of brain activity during innocuous, moderately more intense, and noxious stimulation of an amputee's phantom limb using transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS). Based on the spatio-temporal EEG features, we developed a system for detecting pain perception and reaction in the brain, which successfully classified three different stimulation conditions with a test accuracy of 94.66%, and we investigated the cortical activity in response to sensory stimuli in these conditions. Our findings suggest that the noxious stimulation activates the pre-motor cortex with the highest activation shown in the central cortex (Cz electrode) between 450 ms and 750 ms post-stimulation, whereas the highest activation for the moderately intense stimulation was found in the parietal lobe (P2, P4, and P6 electrodes). Further, we localized the cortical sources and observed early strong activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) corresponding to the noxious stimulus condition. Moreover, activation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was observed during the noxious sensation. Overall, although this is a single case study, this work presents a novel approach and a first attempt to analyze and classify neural activity when restoring sensory perception to amputees, which could chart a route ahead for designing a real-time pain reaction system in upper-limb prostheses.

Real-world structure facilitates the rapid emergence of scene category information in visual brain signals	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; multivariate pattern analysis; real-world structure; scene representation; visual processing	REPRESENTATIONS; OBJECTS; PERCEPTION; FACES	In everyday life, our visual surroundings are not arranged randomly but structured in predictable ways. Although previous studies have shown that the visual system is sensitive to such structural regularities, it remains unclear whether the presence of an intact structure in a scene also facilitates the cortical analysis of the scene's categorical content. To address this question, we conducted an EEG experiment during which participants viewed natural scene images that were either "intact" (with their quadrants arranged in typical positions) or "jumbled" (with their quadrants arranged into atypical positions). We then used multivariate pattern analysis to decode the scenes' category from the EEG signals (e.g., whether the participant had seen a church or a supermarket). The category of intact scenes could be decoded rapidly within the first 100 ms of visual processing. Critically, within 200 ms of processing, category decoding was more pronounced for the intact scenes compared with the jumbled scenes, suggesting that the presence of real-world structure facilitates the extraction of scene category information. No such effect was found when the scenes were presented upside down, indicating that the facilitation of neural category information is indeed linked to a scene's adherence to typical real-world structure rather than to differences in visual features between intact and jumbled scenes. Our results demonstrate that early stages of categorical analysis in the visual system exhibit tuning to the structure of the world that may facilitate the rapid extraction of behaviorally relevant information from rich natural environments. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Natural scenes are structured, with different types of information appearing in predictable locations. Here, we use EEG decoding to show that the visual brain uses this structure to efficiently analyze scene content. During early visual processing, the category of a scene (e.g., a church vs. a supermarket) could be more accurately decoded from EEG signals when the scene adhered to its typical spatial structure compared with when it did not.

J	Xu, GW; Ren, TH; Chen, Y; Che, WL				Xu, Gaowei; Ren, Tianhe; Chen, Yu; Che, Wenliang			A One-Dimensional CNN-LSTM Model for Epileptic Seizure Recognition Using EEG Signal Analysis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						convolutional neural network; electroencephalographic; epileptic seizure recognition; long short-term memory; signal analysis	IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION	Frequent epileptic seizures cause damage to the human brain, resulting in memory impairment, mental decline, and so on. Therefore, it is important to detect epileptic seizures and provide medical treatment in a timely manner. Currently, medical experts recognize epileptic seizure activity through the visual inspection of electroencephalographic (EEG) signal recordings of patients based on their experience, which takes much time and effort. In view of this, this paper proposes a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (1D CNN-LSTM) model for automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. Firstly, the raw EEG signal data are pre-processed and normalized. Then, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to effectively extract the features of the normalized EEG sequence data. In addition, the extracted features are then processed by the LSTM layers in order to further extract the temporal features. After that, the output features are fed into several fully connected layers for final epileptic seizure recognition. The performance of the proposed 1D CNN-LSTM model is verified on the public UCI epileptic seizure recognition data set. Experiments results show that the proposed method achieves high recognition accuracies of 99.39% and 82.00% on the binary and five-class epileptic seizure recognition tasks, respectively. Comparing results with traditional machine learning methods including k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and decision trees, other deep learning methods including standard deep neural network and CNN further verify the superiority of the proposed method.

Recent interest in the brains mechanisms of processing olfactory stimuli partly stems from the association of the olfactory system and its deficit with neurodegenerative diseases. New Methods: An olfactory stimulus decoder using features that represent nonlinear behavior content in the recorded EEG data has been introduced for classifying 4 olfactory stimuli in 5 healthy male subjects. Results: We show that by using nonlinear and chaotic features, a subject-specific classifier can be developed for identifying the odors that subjects perceive with an average accuracy of 96.71 % and 88.79 % in the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, respectively. We also employ our methodology in building cross-subject classifiers: once for identifying pleasant and unpleasant odors, and once for the classification of all four olfactory stimuli. The accuracy of our proposed methodology is 91.7 % and 82.1 % in the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, for the odor pleasantness classification. The accuracy of cross-subject classification of all odors is 64.3 % and 54.8 % for the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, respectively, which is well above chance level. Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparison with similar studies reveals that our proposed method outperforms other classification schemes in terms of accuracy. Conclusions: The results can help researchers design more accurate classifiers for the detection of perceived odors using EEG signals. These results can contribute to gaining more insight into the brains process of odor perception.

Due to the use of conductive gels and the adhesive pads, these electrodes are disposable, thus unsuitable for long-term use. Flexible dry electrodes in the literature have been reported to record the biological signals relatively well. Although there are still challenges in this emerging field of research to overcome in the near future. In this manuscript, we have fabricated flexible dry electrodes to record the surface EMG (sEMG) signals. Five hand motions are classified based on the sEMG signals recorded by our electrodes as well as commercially available wet rigid electrodes. The recognition accuracy reaches proximately 85% and 82% for the sEMG signals recorded by the dry and wet electrodes, respectively. Gaussian SVM algorithm is used as the most appropriate classifier here. The classifier accuracy is found out to be relatively similar comparing the commercial wet electrodes to our fabricated dry counterparts.

Classical CSP depends only on spatial filters. To improve its performance, a novel and efficient spatio-temporal filtering strategy is proposed in this paper to extract discriminative features. Common temporal filters are shared among all the spatial channels, so as to reduce the overfitting risk in the case of a small sample size. An efficient alternating optimization algorithm is also developed to optimize coefficients of spatial and temporal filters. To alleviate adverse effects of noise and artifacts and improve implementation efficiency, an l(1)-norm-based sparsity regularization term is further introduced. The resulting problem is tackled by the reweighting technique. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by the experiments using open datasets of BCI Competition.

In this paper, an ensemble SVM-based voting system is proposed. In each line of this system, the EEG signal is transformed into different representations based on discrete cosine transform, Fourier transform, common spatial pattern, and empirical mode decomposition, and then these representations are combined in a triple-frame matrix. These frames are fed into a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network as a feature extractor. For each line, an SVM is employed to classify the extracted feature vectors. Finally, a decision is made based on voting between these SVMs. Performance of the proposed method is examined on the BCI Competition III dataset Iva to separate right hand and foot movement imagery. The simple proposed method achieves the average accuracy of 96.34% for all of the subjects, and 99.70% for the best situation that is an improvement in MI classification. In addition, it can be seen that right side of the brain is more effective than the other side in EEG-based MI classification.

J	Yao, YF; Cui, ZM				Yao, Yufeng; Cui, Zhiming			An Automatic Epilepsy Detection Method Based on Improved Inductive Transfer Learning	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SEIZURE DETECTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; ENTROPIES; DEEP	Epilepsy is a chronic disease caused by sudden abnormal discharge of brain neurons, causing transient brain dysfunction. The seizures of epilepsy have the characteristics of being sudden and repetitive, which has seriously endangered patients' health, cognition, etc. In the current condition, EEG plays a vital role in the diagnosis, judgment, and qualitative location of epilepsy among the clinical diagnosis of various epileptic seizures and is an indispensable means of detection. The study of the EEG signals of patients with epilepsy can provide a strong basis and useful information for in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis. Although, intelligent classification technologies based on machine learning have been widely used to the classification of epilepsy EEG signals and show the effectiveness. In fact, it is difficult to ensure that there is always enough EEG data available for training the model in real life, which will affect the performance of the algorithms. In view of this, to reduce the impact of insufficient data on the detection performance of the algorithms, a novel discriminate least squares regression- (DLSR-) based inductive transfer learning method was introduced which is on the basis of DLSR and the inductive transfer learning. And, it is applied to promote the adaptability and accuracy of the epilepsy EEG signal recognition. The proposed method inherits the advantages of DLSR; it can be more suitable for classification scenarios by expanding the interval between different classes. Meanwhile, it can simultaneously use the data of the target domain and the knowledge of the source domain, which is helpful for getting better performance. The results show that the improved method has more advantages in EEG signal recognition comparing to several other representative methods.

Various types of robots have been applied to the so-called field of Edutainment, i.e., the field that combines education with entertainment. This paper introduces a novel fuzzy-based system for a human-robot cooperative Edutainment. This co-learning system includes a brain-computer interface (BCI) ontology model and a Fuzzy Markup Language (FML)-based Reinforcement Learning Agent (FRL-Agent). The proposed FRL-Agent is composed of (1) a human learning agent, (2) a robotic teaching agent, (3) a Bayesian estimation agent, (4) a robotic BCI agent, (5) a fuzzy machine learning agent, and (6) a fuzzy BCI ontology. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, the FRL-Agent is used as a robot teacher in a number of elementary schools, junior high schools, and at a university to allow robot teachers and students to learn together in the classroom. The participated students use handheld devices to indirectly or directly interact with the robot teachers to learn English. Additionally, a number of university students wear a commercial EEG device with eight electrode channels to learn English and listen to music. In the experiments, the robotic BCI agent analyzes the collected signals from the EEG device and transforms them into five physiological indices when the students are learning or listening. The Bayesian estimation agent and fuzzy machine learning agent optimize the parameters of the FRL agent and store them in the fuzzy BCI ontology. The experimental results show that the robot teachers motivate students to learn and stimulate their progress. The fuzzy machine learning agent is able to predict the five physiological indices based on the eight-channel EEG data and the trained model. In addition, we also train the model to predict the other students' feelings based on the analyzed physiological indices and labeled feelings. The FRL agent is able to provide personalized learning content based on the developed human and robot cooperative edutainment approaches. To our knowledge, the FRL agent has not applied to the teaching fields such as elementary schools before and it opens up a promising new line of research in human and robot co-learning. In the future, we hope the FRL agent will solve such an existing problem in the classroom that the high-performing students feel the learning contents are too simple to motivate their learning or the low-performing students are unable to keep up with the learning progress to choose to give up learning.

ES can be detected using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. However, visual inspection of ES using long-time EEG recordings is a difficult, time-consuming and a costly procedure. Thus, automatic epilepsy recognition is of primary importance. In this paper, a new method is proposed for automatic ES recognition using short-time EEG recordings. The method is based on first decomposing the EEG signals on sub-signals using discrete wavelet transform. Then, from the obtained sub-signals, different non-linear parameters such as approximate entropy (ApEn), largest Lyapunov exponents (LLE) and statistical parameters are determined. These parameters along with phase entropies, calculated through higher order spectrum analysis, are used as an input vector of a multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) for ES recognition. The proposed method is evaluated using the standard EEG database developed by the Department of Epileptology, University of Bonn, Germany. The evaluation is carried out through a large number of classification experiments. Different statistical metrics namely Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp) and classification accuracy (Ac) are calculated and compared to those obtained in the scientific research literature. The obtained results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracies, which are as good as the best existing state-of-the-art methods studied using the same EEG database.

In this paper, we investigate the specific combination of L-21-norm based loss function and regularization to improve the robustness and the sparsity of multilayer ELM. As we all known, the mean square error (MSE) cost function (or squared L-2-norm cost function) is commonly used as optimization cost function for ELM, but it is sensitive to outliers and impulsive noises that are pervasive in real-world data. Our L-21-norm loss function can lessen the harmful influence caused by noises and outliers and enhance robustness and stability of the learned model. Additionally, the row sparse inducing L-21-norm regularization can learn the most-relevant sparse representation and reduce the intrinsic complexity of the learning model. We propose a specific combination of L-21-norm loss function and regularization ELM auto-encoder (LR21-ELM-AE), and then stack LR21-ELM-AE hierarchically to construct the hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-LR21-ELM). Experiments conducted on several well-known benchmark datasets are presented, the results show that the proposed H-LR21-ELM can generate a more robust, more discriminative and sparser model compared with the other state-of-the-art multilayer ELM algorithms.

Very few researches attempted to identify the emotion impairment in PD through EEG signals. The main objective of this work is to classify the emotions perceived by the PD subjects through audio-visual stimuli using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG database of 20 subjects on PD and 20 NC is developed using a 14 channel wireless EEG device at a sampling frequency of 128 Hz. Audiovisual stimuli of six emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust) are used to induce the emotions. The acquired EEG signals are pre-processed using the IIR Butterworth filter to remove the noises, artifacts, and interferences in EEG signals and used to derive three frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) of EEG data. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is used to extract the two most significant features (Maximum Line Length, Maximum Vertical Line Length) from Recurrence Plot (RP). Besides, these features are combined together called ALL features. Therefore, three types of features were tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test its significance in classifying emotions in PD and NC and a five-fold cross-validation method is used to split the features into training and testing set. Finally, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier with two different types of kernel functions used to classify the emotions of PD and NC. The maximum mean accuracy of 89.17%, 84.50% is achieved on NC and PD, respectively. The maximum individual class accuracy of NC/PD is sadness - 90.90/87.50, happiness - 91.10/84.30, fear - 88/84.10, disgust - 88.5/82.70, surprise - 87.4/84.60, and anger - 89.10/83.80. Experimental results indicate that RQA features are highly useful in detecting the emotions in PD compared to other methods and ELM gives the highest mean accuracy compared to other works in the literature.

J	Fard, MK; Fallah, A; Maleki, A				Fard, Mahdie Khaliq; Fallah, Ali; Maleki, Ali			Neural decoding of continuous upper limb movements: a meta-analysis	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						Neural decoding; continuous movements; upper limb; meta-analysis	MOTOR IMAGERY; HETEROGENEITY; BCI	Objective EEG-based motion trajectory decoding makes a promising approach for neurotechnology which can be used for neural control of motion reconstruction and neurorehabilitation tools. However, the feasibility and validity of continuous motion decoding by non-invasive brain activity are not clear. The main aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis across studies that examined the ability of EEG-based continuous motion decoding of upper limb movements. Approach Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC) was used to evaluate the model performance of the studies and considered as an effect size. To estimate the overall effect size of neural decoding of motion trajectory across studies, characteristics of included studies were addressed and the random effect model was applied to the heterogeneous studies which estimated overall effect size distribution. Furthermore, the significant difference between the two subgroups of imagined and executed movements was analysed. Main results The mean of the overall effect size was computed 0.46 across the nonhomogeneous studies. The results showed no significant difference between imagined and executed movements (Chi(2)=0.28, df = 1, p = 0.60). Significance Meta-analysis results confirm that imagination like execution movements can be used for neural decoding of motion trajectory in neural motor control systems. Also, nonlinear compare with linear model statistically confirmed to be more beneficial for complex movements. Furthermore, a new approach of synergy-based motion decoding can be significantly effective to increase model performance and more research needs to evaluate this method for different levels of complexity of movements.

Due to the complexity and diversity of emotions, EEG-based emotion recognition is still a challenging task in pattern recognition. In order to recognize diverse emotions, we propose a novel firefly integrated optimization algorithm (FIOA) in this paper. It can simultaneously accomplish multiple tasks, i.e. the optimal feature selection, parameter setting and classifier selection according to different EEG-based emotion datasets. The FIOA utilizes a ranking probability objection function to guarantee the high accuracy recognition with less features. Moreover, the hybrid encoding expression and the dual updating strategy are developed in the FIOA so as to realize the optimal selection of feature subset and classifier without stagnating in the local optimum. In addition to the public DEAP datasets, we also conducted an EEG-based music emotion experiment involving 20 subjects for the validation of the proposed FIOA. After filtering and segmentation, three categories of features were extracted from every EEG signal. Then FIOA was applied to every subject dataset for two pattern recognition of emotions. The results show that the FIOA can automatically find the optimal features, parameter and classifier for different emotion datasets, which greatly reduces the artificial selection workload. Furthermore, comparing with the binary particle swarm optimization (PSObinary) and the binary firefly (FAbinary), the FIOA can achieve the higher accuracy with less features in the emotion recognition.

In this research, a connectivity analysis of Electro Encephalography study is presented regarding cognitive processes of an instructed liar/truth-teller about identity during an interview. In this survey, connectivity analysis is applied because it can provide unique information about brain activity patterns of lying and interaction among brain regions. The novelty of this paper lies in applying an open-ended questions interview protocol during EEG recording. We recruited 40 healthy participants to record EEG signal during the interview. For each subject, whole-brain functional and effective connectivity networks such as coherence, generalized partial direct coherence and directed directed transfer function, are constructed for the lie-telling and truth-telling conditions. The classification results demonstrate that lying could be differentiated from truth-telling with an accuracy of 86.25% with the leave-one-person-out method. Results show functional and effective connectivity patterns of lying for the average of all frequency bands are different in regions from that of truth-telling. The current study may shed new light on neural patterns of deception from connectivity analysis view point.

The state-of-the-art EEG classification techniques commonly entail the extraction of the multiple features that would be fed into classifiers. For some techniques, the feature selection strategies have been used to reduce the dimensionality of the entire feature space. However, most of these approaches focus on the performance of classifiers while neglecting the association between the feature and the EEG activity itself. To enhance the inner relationship between the feature subset and the epileptic EEG task with a promising classification accuracy, we propose a machine learning-based pipeline using a novel feature selection algorithm built upon a knockoff filter. First, a number of temporal, spectral, and spatial features are extracted from the raw EEG signals. Second, the proposed feature selection algorithm is exploited to obtain the optimal subgroup of features. Afterwards, three classifiers including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are used. The experimental results on the Bonn dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, with accuracy as high as 99.93% for normal and interictal EEG discrimination and 98.95% for interictal and ictal EEG classification. Meanwhile, it has achieved satisfactory sensitivity (95.67% in average), specificity (98.83% in average), and accuracy (98.89% in average) over the Freiburg dataset.

One of these technologies is the Brain-Machine Interface. Combined with EEG signals, this technique may allow individuals with some motor disabilities to perform activities of daily living. Motor Imagery came up as an important tool to support this population. So they may send commands to external devices by using their brain voluntary activity. In this chapter, the performance of an Imagery EEG-based BCI engine was accessed by applyingWavelet transform to the signals and extracting metrics used to describe digital signals. We used signals from the motor imagery of the right hand, left hand and foot movements. Different intelligent classifiers were tested. We achieved results greater than 99% of accuracy and Kappa above 0.99. The method is promising and can be used for future evaluations with several individuals to verify reproducibility.

Brandon			Association of Sleep Electroencephalography-Based Brain Age Index With Dementia	JAMA NETWORK OPEN			English	Article							COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EEG; MILD; OSCILLATIONS; SEX	This cross-sectional study examines a sleep electroencephalography-based brain age index as a potential biomarker associated with dementia. Question Can an electroencephalography-based brain age index, calculated as the difference between chronological and estimated brain age through sleep electroencephalography, serve as a potential biomarker associated with dementia? Findings This cross-sectional study of 9834 polysomnograms using machine learning found that brain age index increased monotonically from nondementia to dementia subpopulations. Meaning These findings suggest that brain age index may be a useful biomarker associated with dementia and could have utility as a screening tool for the presence of underlying neurodegenerative disease and monitoring of disease progression. Importance Dementia is an increasing cause of disability and loss of independence in the elderly population yet remains largely underdiagnosed. A biomarker for dementia that can identify individuals with or at risk for developing dementia may help close this diagnostic gap. Objective To investigate the association between a sleep electroencephalography-based brain age index (BAI), the difference between chronological age and brain age estimated using the sleep electroencephalogram, and dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants In this retrospective cross-sectional study of 9834 polysomnograms, BAI was computed among individuals with previously determined dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitive symptoms but no diagnosis of MCI or dementia, and among healthy individuals without dementia from August 22, 2008, to June 4, 2018. Data were analyzed from November 15, 2018, to June 24, 2020. Exposure Dementia, MCI, and dementia-related symptoms, such as cognitive change and memory impairment. Main Outcomes and Measures The outcome measures were the trend in BAI when moving from groups ranging from healthy, to symptomatic, to MCI, to dementia and pairwise comparisons of BAI among these groups. Findings A total of 5144 sleep studies were included in BAI examinations. Patients in these studies had a median (interquartile range) age of 54 (43-65) years, and 3026 (59%) were men. The patients included 88 with dementia, 44 with MCI, 1075 who were symptomatic, and 2336 without dementia. There was a monotonic increase in mean (SE) BAI from the nondementia group to the dementia group (nondementia: 0.20 [0.42]; symptomatic: 0.58 [0.41]; MCI: 1.65 [1.20]; dementia: 4.18 [1.02]; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that a sleep-state electroencephalography-based BAI shows promise as a biomarker associated with progressive brain processes that ultimately result in dementia.

Although it has been well recognized that many physiological parameters are linked to the state of thermal comfort or discomfort of humans, how to use physiological signal to judge the state of thermal comfort has not been well studied. In this paper, the feasibility of continuously determining feelings of personal thermal comfort was discussed by using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in private space. In the study, 22 subjects were exposed to thermally comfortable and uncomfortably hot environments, and their EEG signals were recorded. Spectral power features of the EEG signals were extracted, and an ensemble learning method using linear discriminant analysis or support vector machine as a sub-classifier was used to build the discriminant model. The results show that an average discriminate accuracy of 87.9% can be obtained within a detection window of 60 seconds. This study indicates that it is feasible to distinguish whether a person feels comfortable or too hot in their private space by multi-channel EEG signals without interruption and suggests possibility for further applications in neuroergonomics.

However, the scientific community remains unclear on the reason or possible bio markers that can discern potentially fatal seizures from other non-fatal seizures. The duration of postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) is a promising candidate to aid in identifying SUDEP risk. The length of time a patient experiences PGES after a seizure may be used to infer the risk a patient may have of SUDEP later in life. However, the problem becomes identifying the duration, or marking the end, of PGES (Tomson et al. in Lancet Neurol 7(11):1021-1031, 2008; Nashef in Epilepsia 38:6-8, 1997).MethodsThis work addresses the problem of marking the end to PGES in EEG data, extracted from patients during a clinically supervised seizure. This work proposes a sensitivity analysis on EEG window size/delay, feature extraction and classifiers along with associated hyperparameters. The resulting sensitivity analysis includes the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Random Forest classifiers trained on 10 extracted features rooted in fundamental EEG behavior using an EEG specific feature extraction process (pyEEG) and 5 different window sizes or delays (Bao et al. in Comput Intell Neurosci 2011:1687-5265, 2011).ResultsThe machine learning architecture described above scored a maximum AUC score of 76.02% with the Random Forest classifier trained on all extracted features. The highest performing features included SVD Entropy, Petrosan Fractal Dimension and Power Spectral Intensity.ConclusionThe methods described are effective in automatically marking the end to PGES. Future work should include integration of these methods into the clinical setting and using the results to be able to predict a patient's SUDEP risk.

Factors influencing classification of frequency following responses to speech and music stimuli	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Frequency following response; Brain decoding; EEG classification	AUDITORY BRAIN-STEM; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PITCH; INFORMATION; DISCRIMINATION; IDENTIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION; VARIABILITY	Successful mapping of meaningful labels to sound input requires accurate representation of that sound's acoustic variances in time and spectrum. For some individuals, such as children or those with hearing loss, having an objective measure of the integrity of this representation could be useful. Classification is a promising machine learning approach which can be used to objectively predict a stimulus label from the brain response. This approach has been previously used with auditory evoked potentials (AEP) such as the frequency following response (FFR), but a number of key issues remain unresolved before classification can be translated into clinical practice. Specifically, past efforts at FFR classification have used data from a given subject for both training and testing the classifier. It is also unclear which components of the FFR elicit optimal classification accuracy. To address these issues, we recorded FFRs from 13 adults with normal hearing in response to speech and music stimuli. We compared labeling accuracy of two cross-validation classification approaches using FFR data: (1) a more traditional method combining subject data in both the training and testing set, and (2) a "leave-one-out" approach, in which subject data is classified based on a model built exclusively from the data of other individuals. We also examined classification accuracy on decomposed and time-segmented FFRs. Our results indicate that the accuracy of leave-one-subject-out cross validation approaches that obtained in the more conventional cross-validation classifications while allowing a subject's results to be analysed with respect to normative data pooled from a separate population. In addition, we demonstrate that classification accuracy is highest when the entire FFR is used to train the classifier. Taken together, these efforts contribute key steps toward translation of classification-based machine learning approaches into clinical practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Emotional response mostly appears in the presence of visual, auditory, tactile, and gustatory arousals. In our work, we use visual stimuli to evaluate the emotional feedback. One of the best performing methods in emotion estimation applications is the common spatial patterns (CSP). We implement CSP method in addition to the conventional Welch power spectral density-based analysis. Experimental results and topographies on the collected EEG data show that the CSP spatial filtering method implies the relationship between EEG bands, EEG channels, neural efficiency and emotional stimuli types.

Decoding Hearing-Related Changes in Older Adults' Spatiotemporal Neural Processing of Speech Using Machine Learning	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						speech perception; aging; event-related potentials; hearing loss; machine learning; stability selection and control; support vector machine	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; BOUNDARY-ELEMENT METHOD; AUDITORY-CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTION; NOISE; LATENCY; EEG; LATERALIZATION	Speech perception in noisy environments depends on complex interactions between sensory and cognitive systems. In older adults, such interactions may be affected, especially in those individuals who have more severe age-related hearing loss. Using a data-driven approach, we assessed the temporal (whenin time) and spatial (wherein the brain) characteristics of cortical speech-evoked responses that distinguish older adults with or without mild hearing loss. We performed source analyses to estimate cortical surface signals from the EEG recordings during a phoneme discrimination task conducted under clear and noise-degraded conditions. We computed source-level ERPs (i.e., mean activation within each ROI) from each of the 68 ROIs of the Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlas, averaged over a randomly chosen 100 trials without replacement to form feature vectors. We adopted a multivariate feature selection method called stability selection and control to choose features that are consistent over a range of model parameters. We use parameter optimized support vector machine (SVM) as a classifiers to investigate thetime courseandbrain regionsthat segregate groups and speech clarity. For clear speech perception, whole-brain data revealed a classification accuracy of 81.50% [area under the curve (AUC) 80.73%; F1-score 82.00%], distinguishing groups within similar to 60 ms after speech onset (i.e., as early as the P1 wave). We observed lower accuracy of 78.12% [AUC 77.64%; F1-score 78.00%] and delayed classification performance when speech was embedded in noise, with group segregation at 80 ms. Separate analysis using left (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) regions showed that LH speech activity was better at distinguishing hearing groups than activity measured in the RH. Moreover, stability selection analysis identified 12 brain regions (among 1428 total spatiotemporal features from 68 regions) where source activity segregated groups with >80% accuracy (clear speech); whereas 16 regions were critical for noise-degraded speech to achieve a comparable level of group segregation (78.7% accuracy). Our results identify critical time-courses and brain regions that distinguish mild hearing loss from normal hearing in older adults and confirm a larger number of active areas, particularly in RH, when processing noise-degraded speech information.

Among various EEG-based emotion recognition studies, due to the non-linear, non-stationary and the individual difference of EEG signals, traditional recognition methods still have the disadvantages of complicated feature extraction and low recognition rates. Thus, this paper first proposes a novel concept of electrode-frequency distribution maps (EFDMs) with short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Residual block based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for automatic feature extraction and emotion classification with EFDMs. Aim at the shortcomings of the small amount of EEG samples and the challenge of differences in individual emotions, which makes it difficult to construct a universal model, this paper proposes a cross-datasets emotion recognition method of deep model transfer learning. Experiments carried out on two publicly available datasets. The proposed method achieved an average classification score of 90.59% based on a short length of EEG data on SEED, which is 4.51% higher than the baseline method. Then, the pre-trained model was applied to DEAP through deep model transfer learning with a few samples, resulted an average accuracy of 82.84%. Finally, this paper adopts the gradient weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to get a glimpse of what features the CNN has learned during training from EFDMs and concludes that the high frequency bands are more favorable for emotion recognition.

Motor imagery relevant electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are weak, nonlinear, and susceptible to interference. As a feature extraction method for motor imagery, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) has been proven to be very effective. However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the choice of frequency bands, and Euclidean space cannot effectively describe the inner relationship. To solve these problems, a classification approach for motor imagery using the Geodesic Filtering Common Spatial Pattern (GFCSP) and filter-bank Feature Weighted Support Vector Machine (FWSVM) is presented. First, GFCSP based on the Riemannian manifold is proposed, in which the extracted covariance features are spatially filtered in Riemannian tangent space, and the average covariance matrix is replaced by Riemannian mean in CSP. Second, filter-bank FWSVM with a feature weighted matrix is proposed. EEG signals are filtered into 8-12 Hz, 12-16 Hz, 18-22 Hz, 22-26 Hz, and a wide band of 8-24 Hz, and GFCSP features of these filtered signals are extracted. A feature weighted matrix is calculated using mutual information and the Pearson correlation coefficient from these features and class information. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification with the feature weighted matrix. Finally, the proposed method is validated on the dataset IVa in BCI competition III. Classification accuracies of the five subjects are 92.31%, 99.03%, 80.36%, 96.30%, and 97.67%, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In this paper, a feature analysis method based on the combination of brain functional network and common spatial pattern is proposed to solve the dichotomy of unilateral (right) hand motor imagination. Firstly, the phase analysis between Mu rhythm and Beta rhythm signals is carried out, and then the brain functional network topology is drawn according to the phase synchronization information matrix. Through analysis, Mu rhythm of MI - EEG signals than Beta rhythm is more active, and phase synchronization oscillation is concentrated in the center of the brain area C, FC and CP. Then, the concept of graph theory is used to extract the network attribute features under two rhythms: clustering coefficient and shortest path length, and the common space mode method is used to extract the spatial domain features, and the two types of features form an 8-dimensional feature vector. Finally, the features are classified by SVM, and the average classification accuracy is 94.69%, which is higher than that of the two methods. The research content of this paper breaks through the traditional right-handed MIEEG classification problem, and the method in this paper does not need to consider the ERD/ERS phenomenon, thus expanding the range of data that can be classified.

Over the years, in attempt to predict epileptic seizures in patients using electroencephalographic (EEG) data, several machine learning based models and algorithms have been developed but many of them present shortcomings such as having computationally inefficient algorithms, limited EEG data and there is no one size fits all patients model. Here a generalised seizure prediction algorithm based on extremely randomised tree classification is presented that can be applied to all patients with a minimal number of features to provide increased computational efficiency and comparable performance score relative to a more complicated state-of-the-art algorithm. The new algorithm achieves a 3.25 factor speed up in computation time while achieving an average Area under the curve, AUC of 0.74 relative to 0.72 for the state-of-the-art algorithm. The algorithm is designed to be implemented on small implantable/wearable EEG devices with little computing power, in order to preserve battery life and help make seizure prediction a clinically viable option for patients with epilepsy.

In recent years, it has been shown that EEG is an appropriate signal for the biometric authentication and has important features such as resistance to spoofing attacks and impossibility to use under pressure and coercion states. In this paper, the state-of-the-art methods in EEG based authentication are reviewed. This review includes a number of aspects such as the various tasks that the user required to perform during the authentication, devices and available datasets, the preprocessing procedures and the classification methods used in the EEG biometric authentication. Both shallow and deep classification methods are reviewed in this paper. The study shows that the deep learning approaches which are used in the past few years, although still require further research, have shown great results. Moreover, the paper summarizes the works to address the open challenges of this area. The EEG authentication challenges have been discussed from a variety of points of view, including privacy, user-friendliness, attacks, and authentication requirements such as universality, permanency, uniqueness, and collectability. This paper can be used as a preliminary plan and a roadmap for researchers interested in EEG biometric. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Machine Learning Approach to Diagnose Schizophrenia Based on Effective Connectivity of Resting EEG Data	2020 IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SYMPOSIUM	IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Signal Processing in Medicine and Biology Symposium	DEC 05, 2020	Philadelphia, PA	IEEE, Temple Univ, Sci Educ & Res Ctr, Neural Engn Data Consortium, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Reg 2, Signal Proc Soc Philadelphia Sect			BRAIN; SIGNALS; LOBE	Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder associated with neurobiological deficits. Despite the fact that the brain activity during tasks (i.e. P300 activities) are considered as biomarkers for diagnosing schizophrenia, brain activities at rest has the potential to reveal an intrinsic dysfunctionality in patients with schizophrenia and can be used to understand the cognitive deficits in these patients. In this study, we develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm based on eye closed resting-EEG data sets aiming to distinguish 63 schizophrenic patients (SCZs) from 70 healthy controls (HCs). The ML algorithm has three steps. In the first step an effective connectivity named symbolic transfer entropy (STE) is applied to the EEG waveforms. In the second step brain network properties are constructed from STE. In the third step the ML algorithm is applied to brain network properties to determine whether a set of features can be found that successfully discriminates SCZ from HC. The findings of this study revealed that the most discriminating features are shortest-path-length between different brain regions that could achieve an accuracy of 96.15%, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92.86% using 20% of data samples as test dataset that is not used for training. These findings imply that resting EEG could contribute to our ability to distinguish SCZs from HCs, and that the STE effective connectivity may prove to be a promising tool for the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Specifically, this work proposes a direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external mechatronic actuator, by interlacing - among each other - heterogeneous sensors, worn by the human user, embedded on personal care robot (PCR) and distributed all around the environment where the user is living. In the here described case study, the patient/user wears a wireless headset for electroencephalography (EEG). Then, the acquired brain signals are wirelessly sent to a PCR that analyzes them via a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Specifically, the BCI exploits an end-to-end binary processing technique known as symbolization to extract features from the EEG data, through a fast classifier to discriminate user intentions and needs. BCI outputs are translated in specific autonomous navigation and object manipulation routines, which allow the PCR to satisfy the user requests. Both routines are based on the joint analysis of data from RGB cameras, 3D sensors, sonars, and IR sensors. In-vivo tests demonstrated that the PCR embedded BCI algorithm is able to decode EEG signals and send a command to the actuator in similar to 883ms while keeping accuracy in classification of 84%. The results demonstrate that the 75% of the requests formalized by the users are successfully satisfied by the PCR.

J	Taylor, JA; Garrido, MI				Taylor, Jeremy A.; Garrido, Marta, I			Porthole and Stormcloud: Tools for Visualisation of Spatiotemporal M/EEG Statistics	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG; MEG; Space-time cube; Visualisation; Statistical parametric mapping; Machine learning		Electro- and magneto-encephalography are functional neuroimaging modalities characterised by their ability to quantify dynamic spatiotemporal activity within the brain. However, the visualisation techniques used to illustrate these effects are currently limited to single- or multi-channel time series plots, topographic scalp maps and orthographic cross-sections of the spatiotemporal data structure. Whilst these methods each have their own strength and weaknesses, they are only able to show a subset of the data and are suboptimal at articulating one or both of the space-time components. Here, we propose Porthole and Stormcloud, a set of data visualisation tools which can automatically generate context appropriate graphics for both print and screen with the following graphical capabilities: Animated two-dimensional scalp maps with dynamic timeline annotation and optional user interaction; Three-dimensional construction of discrete clusters within sparse spatiotemporal volumes, rendered with 'cloud-like' appearance and augmented by cross-sectional scalp maps indicating local maxima. These publicly available tools were designed specifically for visualisation of M/EEG spatiotemporal statistical parametric maps, however, we also demonstrate alternate use cases of posterior probability maps and weight maps produced by machine learning classifiers. In principle, the methods employed here are transferrable to visualisation of any spatiotemporal image.

Classification of sleep stages with electroencephalography (EEG) is preferred to other biological signals due to its advantages such as providing clinical information, cost-effectiveness, comfort, and ease of use. The evaluation of EEG signals taken during sleep by clinicians is a tiring, time-consuming, and error-prone method. Therefore, it is clinically mandatory to determine sleep stages by using software-supported systems. Like all classification problems, the accuracy rate is used to compare the performance of studies in this domain, but this metric can be accurate when the number of observations is equal in classes. However, since there is not an equal number of observations in sleep stages, this metric is insufficient in the evaluation of such systems. For this purpose, in recent years, Cohen's kappa coefficient and even the sensitivity of NREM1 have been used for comparing the performance of these systems. Still, none of them examine the system from all dimensions. Therefore, in this study, two new metrics based on the polygon area metric, called the normalized area of sensitivity polygon and normalized area of the general polygon, are proposed for the performance evaluation of sleep staging systems. In addition, a new sleep staging system is introduced using the applications offered by the MATLAB program. The existing systems discussed in the literature were examined with the proposed metrics, and the best systems were compared with the proposed sleep staging system. According to the results, the proposed system excels in comparison with the most advanced machine learning methods. The single-channel method introduced based on the proposed metrics can be used for robust and reliable sleep stage classification from all dimensions required for real-time applications.

Although BCI applications are numerous, their use outside laboratories is still scarce due to their poor accuracy. Some users cannot use BCIs, a phenomenon sometimes called "BCI illiteracy", which impacts around 10% to 30% of BCI users, who cannot produce discriminable EEG patterns. By performing neurophysiological analyses, and notably by identifying neurophysiological predictors of BCI performance, we may understand this phenomenon and its causes better. In turn, this may also help us to better understand and thus possibly improve, BCI user training. Therefore, this paper presents statistical models dedicated to the prediction of MI-BCI user performance, based on neurophysiological users' features extracted from a two minute EEG recording of a "relax with eyes open" condition. We consider data from 56 subjects that were recorded in a 'relax with eyes open' condition before performing a MI-BCI experiment. We used machine learning regression algorithm with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to build our model of prediction. We also computed different correlations between those features (neurophysiological predictors) and users' MI-BCI performances. Our results suggest such models could predict user performances significantly better than chance (p <= 0.01) but with a relatively high mean absolute error of 12.43%. We also found significant correlations between a few of our features and the performance, including the previously explored mu-band predictor, as well as a new one proposed here: the mu-peak location variability. These results are thus encouraging to better understand and predict BCI illiteracy. However, they also require further improvements in order to obtain more reliable predictions.

This architecture is designed to detect seizure events from raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as opposed to the state-of-the-art hand engineered feature-based representation employed in traditional machine learning based solutions. The seizure detection system utilises only convolutional layers in order to process the multichannel time domain signal and is designed to exploit the large amount of weakly labelled data in the training stage. The system performance is assessed on a large database of continuous EEG recordings of 834h in duration; this is further validated on a held-out publicly available dataset and compared with two baseline SVM based systems. The developed system achieves a 56% relative improvement with respect to a feature-based state-of-the art baseline, reaching an AUC of 98.5%; this also compares favourably both in terms of performance and run-time. The effect of varying architectural parameters is thoroughly studied. The performance improvement is achieved through novel architecture design which allows more efficient usage of available training data and end-to-end optimisation from the front-end feature extraction to the back-end classification. The proposed architecture opens new avenues for the application of deep learning to neonatal EEG, where the performance becomes a function of the amount of training data with less dependency on the availability of precise clinical labels.

We build and compare several alternative CNN architectures, using nested cross-validation to evaluate performance on unseen patients for different hyperparameter values. Performance after model selection exceeds human expert inter-scorer agreement, even if only a single EEG input channel is used, and is competitive with the state of the art. We further investigate the effect of additional pre-sleep and post-sleep waking data in the training samples. We use t-SNE to visualize the responses of the internal layers of our network, enabling a more complete picture of the development of sleep stage differentiation with layer depth than do activation maximization approaches.

Yet, how incoming sensory information interacts with ongoing spontaneous brain activity, what features of the neuronal microcircuitry underlie spontaneous and stimulus-evoked spectral fin-gerprints, and what these fingerprints entail for stimulus encoding, remain largely open questions. We used a combination of human invasive electrophysiology, computational modeling and decoding techniques to assess the information encoding properties of brain activity and to relate them to a plausible underlying neuronal micro -architecture. We analyzed intracortical auditory EEG activity from 10 patients while they were listening to short sentences. Pre-stimulus neural activity in early auditory cortical regions often exhibited power spectra with a shoulder in the delta range and a small bump in the beta range. Speech decreased power in the beta range, and increased power in the delta-theta and gamma ranges. Using multivariate machine learning techniques, we assessed the spectral profile of information content for two aspects of speech processing: detection and discrimination. We obtained better phase than power information decoding, and a bimodal spectral profile of information content with better decoding at low (delta-theta) and high (gamma) frequencies than at intermediate (beta) frequencies. These experimental data were reproduced by a simple rate model made of two subnetworks with different timescales, each composed of coupled excitatory and inhibitory units, and connected via a negative feedback loop. Modeling and experimental results were similar in terms of pre-stimulus spectral profile (except for the iEEG beta bump), spectral modulations with speech, and spectral profile of information content. Altogether, we provide converging evidence from both univariate spectral analysis and decoding approaches for a dual timescale processing infrastructure in human auditory cortex, and show that it is consistent with the dynamics of a simple rate model.

Robotic-assisted gait training offers an opportunity for the practice intensity levels associated with good functional walking outcomes in this population. Neural interfacing technology, electroencephalography (EEG), or electromyography (EMG) can offer new strategies for robotic gait re-education after a stroke by promoting more active engagement in movement intent and/or neurophysiological feedback. Objectives: This study identifies the current state-of-the-art and the limitations in direct neural interfacing with robotic gait devices in stroke rehabilitation. Methods: A pre-registered systematic review was conducted using standardized search operators that included the presence of stroke and robotic gait training and neural biosignals (EMG and/or EEG) and was not limited by study type. Results: From a total of 8,899 papers identified, 13 articles were considered for the final selection. Only five of the 13 studies received a strong or moderate quality rating as a clinical study. Three studies recorded EEG activity during robotic gait, two of which used EEG for BCI purposes. While demonstrating utility for decoding kinematic and EMG-related gait data, no EEG study has been identified to close the loop between robot and human. Twelve of the studies recorded EMG activity during or after robotic walking, primarily as an outcome measure. One study used multisource information fusion from EMG, joint angle, and force to modify robotic commands in real time, with higher error rates observed during active movement. A novel study identified used EMG data during robotic gait to derive the optimal, individualized robot-driven step trajectory. Conclusions: Wide heterogeneity in the reporting and the purpose of neurobiosignal use during robotic gait training after a stroke exists. Neural interfacing with robotic gait after a stroke demonstrates promise as a future field of study. However, as a nascent area, direct neural interfacing with robotic gait after a stroke would benefit from a more standardized protocol for biosignal collection and processing and for robotic deployment. Appropriate reporting for clinical studies of this nature is also required with respect to the study type and the participants' characteristics.

However, either it can only deal with binary class problem or can deal with multi-class classification problem by breaking the problem into number of binary class problem and solving them individually or through solving larger optimization. Aiming to improve performance of support matrix machines, in this paper, we present Multi-class Support Matrix Machine based on evolutionary optimization (MSMM-CE) by breaking down the original multi-class problem of support matrix into subproblems in cooperative fashion. The proposed objective function is a combination of binary hinge loss function for specific class, Frobenius and nuclear norms as a penalty that promote low rank and sparsity as well as an additional penalty term to penalize the multiclass classification error. The additional penalty term allow us to decompose the problem into sub-problems and solving them in simultaneously in cooperative fashion. The proposed objective function learns for each class and consider the information from other classes, that results in solving the problem in parallel. A comprehensive experimental study on publicly available benchmark EEG dataset is carried out to investigate the proposed approach that confirms the superiority of MSMM-CE for accurate classification of EEG signal associated with motor imagery in BCI applications. MSMM-CE provides a generalized solution to investigate the complex and nonlinear high dimensional data for various real-world applications.

To guide the processing resources to the related visual scene aspects, covert attention should be decoded from human brain. Here, a novel expert system is designed to decode covert visual attention based on the EEG signal provided from 15 subjects during a new task based on a change in lumination to two blue and orange color on the right and the left side of the screen, which is evaluated in two cases of binary and multi-class systems. For the first time, Phase transfer entropy (PTE) has been used in these systems, and after selecting the optimal decoding feature, the frequency band (8-13 Hz) Alpha and Beta1 (13-20 Hz) have the best performance compared to other frequency bands. Two-class classification accuracies of the designed system in two frequency bands (Alpha and Beta1) are 91.87% and 89.53%, respectively. Also, the accuracies are 65.11% and 63.38% for multi-class classification in specified frequency bands. In these frequency bands, the parietal and frontal lobes showed the most significant difference in comparison to the other lobes. Also, the obtained results declared that the expert system's performance in the Alpha band by the extracted features from the Posterior region is better than all frequency bands in other different brain regions. The performance of the proposed expert system by PTE is significantly better than the previous phase synchronization based features. Results have shown that the PTE feature performs better than the common methods for decoding covert visual attention.

This study describes an automated classification of EEG signal for the detection of Epilepsy disease using soft computing methods. The proposed method is comprised of three modules: (a) transformation, (b) feature computation, and (c) feature classifications. In the first module, the nonsubsampled contourlet transform is applied on the EEG signal which decomposes the signal into approximate and directional subbands. The decomposition is done using nonsubsampled pyramid filter bank and nonsubsampled directional filter bank respectively. Secondly, the statistical features are extracted from the decomposed directional subbands using wavelet packet decomposition method. Finally, these features are classified by adaptive neuro-Fuzzy inference system classification method, which classifies the EEG signal into either focal or nonfocal signal. The proposed method is tested on a set of EEG signals for validation. The average classification rate of the proposed EEG signal classification system is 99.4%. The proposed EEG signal classification methodology achieves a sensitivity of 99.7%, a specificity of 99.7%, and an accuracy of 99.4%. The results confirmed that the proposed method has a potential in the classification of EEG signals and thereby could further improve the diagnosis of epilepsy.

J	Alhalaseh, R; Alasasfeh, S				Alhalaseh, Rania; Alasasfeh, Suzan			Machine-Learning-Based Emotion Recognition System Using EEG Signals	COMPUTERS			English	Article						EEG; CNN; EMD; VMD; emotion recognition	CLASSIFICATION MODEL; AROUSAL	Many scientific studies have been concerned with building an automatic system to recognize emotions, and building such systems usually relies on brain signals. These studies have shown that brain signals can be used to classify many emotional states. This process is considered difficult, especially since the brain's signals are not stable. Human emotions are generated as a result of reactions to different emotional states, which affect brain signals. Thus, the performance of emotion recognition systems by brain signals depends on the efficiency of the algorithms used to extract features, the feature selection algorithm, and the classification process. Recently, the study of electroencephalography (EEG) signaling has received much attention due to the availability of several standard databases, especially since brain signal recording devices have become available in the market, including wireless ones, at reasonable prices. This work aims to present an automated model for identifying emotions based on EEG signals. The proposed model focuses on creating an effective method that combines the basic stages of EEG signal handling and feature extraction. Different from previous studies, the main contribution of this work relies in using empirical mode decomposition/intrinsic mode functions (EMD/IMF) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) for signal processing purposes. Despite the fact that EMD/IMFs and VMD methods are widely used in biomedical and disease-related studies, they are not commonly utilized in emotion recognition. In other words, the methods used in the signal processing stage in this work are different from the methods used in literature. After the signal processing stage, namely in the feature extraction stage, two well-known technologies were used: entropy and Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD). Finally, in the classification stage, four classification methods were used-naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and decision tree (DT)-for classifying emotional states. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, experiments were applied to a common database called DEAP based on many evaluation models, including accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. The experiments showed the efficiency of the proposed method; a 95.20% accuracy was achieved using the CNN-based method.

However, there is still a long way to go to make EEG biometrics practical in real-world environments. One of the challenges of the EEG-based biometric systems is time efficiency. The protocols that can evoke individual-dependent EEG patterns are usually time consuming. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the EEG signal is also low, which means a large number of epochs/trials (i.e. long acquisition time) are required to achieve a high accuracy recognition system. In this study we propose an EEG-based biometric model that could achieve high identification accuracy with data instances as short as only 1.1s (single epoch instances). In our biometric model, we propose a new protocol called the N-back task which is based on human working memory. As the nature of working memory is very short, it would be possible to elicit individual-dependent EEG responses within a very short period of time. The single epoch classification was achieved applying a deep neural network called EEGNet. Using 1.1s data instances, the proposed model could identify a pool of 26 subjects with the mean accuracy of 0.95, where recognition rate for majority of subjects was >0.99. Different components of this identity recognition model, from the proposed protocol to the classification algorithm, can he a line of research for the future of EEG biometric.

Assessment of the psychiatric emergency is a challenging issue for clinicians working with alcohol-dependent patients. Identifying alcoholics from healthy controls from their EEG signals can be effective in this scenario. In this research, we have applied two instance-based classifiers and three neural network classifier to classify Electroencephalogram data of alcoholics and normal person. For data preprocessing, we have applied discrete wavelet transform, Principal component analysis and Independent component analysis. After successful implementation of the classifiers, an accuracy of 95% is received with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory. Finally, comparing the performance of the two categories of algorithms, we have found that neural networks have higher potentiality against instance-based classifiers in the classification of EEG signals of alcoholics.

It relies on the visual inspection of polysomnography records by trained sleep technologists. Automated approaches have been designed to alleviate this resource-intensive task. However, such approaches are usually compared to a single human scorer annotation despite an inter-rater agreement of about 85% only. The present study introduces two publicly-available datasets, DOD-H including 25 healthy volunteers and DOD-O including 55 patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Both datasets have been scored by 5 sleep technologists from different sleep centers. We developed a framework to compare automated approaches to a consensus of multiple human scorers. Using this framework, we benchmarked and compared the main literature approaches to a new deep learning method, SimpleSleepNet, which reach state-of-the-art performances while being more lightweight. We demonstrated that many methods can reach human-level performance on both datasets. SimpleSleepNet achieved an F1 of 89.9% vs 86.8% on average for human scorers on DOD-H, and an F1 of 88.3% vs 84.8% on DOD-O. Our study highlights that state-of-the-art automated sleep staging outperforms human scorers performance for healthy volunteers and patients suffering from OSA. Considerations could be made to use automated approaches in the clinical setting.

Specifically, classifying pilots' mental states accurately is a critical issue because their cognitive states, which are induced by mental fatigue, workload, and distraction, may be fundamental in catastrophic accidents. In this study, we present an electroencephalogram (EEG) classification of four mental states (fatigue, workload, distraction, and the normal state) from EEG signals in both offline and pseudo-online analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to classify pilots' mental states using only EEG signals during continuous decoding. We recorded EEG signals from seven pilots under various simulated flight conditions. We proposed a multiple feature block-based convolutional neural network (MFB-CNN) with temporal-spatio EEG filters to recognize the pilot's current mental states. We validated the proposed method for two analyses across all subjects. In the offline analysis, we confirmed the classification accuracy of 0.75 (+/- 0.04). Also, in the pseudo-online analysis, we obtained the detection accuracy of 0.72 (+/- 0.20), 0.72 (+/- 0.27), and 0.61 (+/- 0.18) for fatigue, workload, and distraction, respectively. Hence, we demonstrate the feasibility of classifying various types of mental states for implementation in real-world environments.

We used three-dimensional (arousal, valence and dominance) model of emotion to recognize the emotions induced by music videos. The participants watched a video (1 min long) while their EEG was recorded. The main objective of the study is to identify the features that can best discriminate the emotions. Power, entropy, fractal dimension, statistical features and wavelet energy are extracted from the EEG signals. The effects of these features are investigated and the best features are identified. The performance of the two feature selection methods, Relief based algorithm and principle component analysis (PCA), is compared. PCA is adopted because of its improved performance and the efficacies of the features are validated using support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors and decision tree classifiers. Our system achieves an overall best classification accuracy of 77.62%, 78.96% and 77.60% for valence, arousal and dominance respectively. Our results demonstrated that time-domain statistical characteristics of EEG signals can efficiently discriminate different emotional states. Also, the use of three-dimensional emotion model is able to classify similar emotions that were not correctly classified by two-dimensional model (e.g. anger and fear). The results of this study can be used to support the development of real-time EEG-based emotion recognition systems.

We presented a simple and efficient algorithmic framework of ICA-based MI BCI (ICA-MIBCI) for the evaluation of four classical ICA algorithms (Infomax, FastICA, Jade, and Sobi) as well as a simplified Infomax (sInfomax). Two novel performance indexes, self-test accuracy and the number of invalid ICA filters, were employed to assess the performance of MIBCI based on different ICA variants. As a reference method, common spatial pattern (CSP), a commonly-used spatial filtering method, was employed for the comparative study between ICA-MIBCI and CSP-MIBCI. The experimental results showed that sInfomax-based spatial filters exhibited significantly better transferability in session to session and subject to subject transfer as compared to CSP-based spatial filters. The online experiment was also introduced to demonstrate the practicability and feasibility of sInfomax-based MIBCI. However, four classical ICA variants, especially FastICA, Jade, and Sobi, performed much worse as compared to sInfomax and CSP in terms of classification accuracy and stability. We consider that conventional ICA-based spatial filtering methods tend to be overfitting while applied to real-life electroencephalogram data. Nevertheless, the sInfomax-based experimental results indicate that ICA methods have a great space for improvement in the application of MIBCI. We believe that this paper could bring forth new ideas for the practical implementation of ICA-MIBCI.

To address this problem, we advance a unified permutation-based inference framework for testing statistical difference in the topological feature persistence landscape (PL) of multi-trial EEG signals.

Specifically, focal spikes in patient-specific channels as well as other patient specific patterns can strongly indicate seizure activity. Manual diagnosis on these markers leads to inconsistent interrater agreement and poor detection accuracy. Previous automation attempts have ignored patient specific approaches but fail to generalize to previously unseen patients. To reduce subjectivity in manual diagnosis, we propose an automatic seizure detection pipeline that includes quality control, preprocessing, and meta transfer learning for both feature extraction and classification. To mitigate the inter-patient seizure pattern variation, we adapt Meta UPdate Strategy (MUPS) for four-class classification on the world's largest public seizure dataset of EEGs, Temple University Seizure Corpus (TUSZ). Different from existing works on binary seizure detection, we use the non-seizure samples and the top three most frequent seizure types for seizure detection. Our experiments show that the meta transfer learning approach achieves macro-F1 of 0.5103 and AUC of 0.6792, which outperforms the baseline learners (shallow and deep) by mitigating patient-topatient variations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of meta transfer learning in feature extraction and classification for multi-class seizure detection.

Motor imagery recognition in electroencephalograms using convolutional neural networks	COMPUTER OPTICS			Russian	Article						image analysis; pattern recognition; neural networks; electroencephalogram; Gramian angular field; Markov transition field; motor imagery recognition; convolutional neural networks		Electroencephalography is a widespread method to record brain signals with the use of electrodes located on the surface of the head. This method of recording the brain activity has become popular because it is relatively cheap, compact, and does not require implanting the electrodes directly into the brain. The article is devoted to a problem of recognition of motor imagery by electroencephalogram signals. The nature of such signals is complex. Characteristics of electroencephalograms are individual for every person, also depending on their age and mental state, as well as the presence of noise and interference. The multitude of these parameters should be taken into account when analyzing encephalograms. Artificial neural networks are a good tool for solving this class of problems. Their application allows combining the tasks of extracting, selecting and classifying features in one signal processing unit. Electroencephalograms are time signals and we note that Gramian Angular Fields and Markov Transition Field transforms are used to represent time series in the form of images. The article shows the possibility of using the Gramian Angular Fields and Markov Transition Field transformations of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal for motor imagery recognition using examples of imaginary movements with the right and left hand, also studying the effect of the resolution of Gramian Angular Fields and Markov Transition Field images on the classification accuracy. The best classification accuracy of the EEG signal into the motion and state-of-rest classes is about 99%. In future, the research results can be applied in constructing the brain-computer interface.

A system for emotion recognition using this dataset was tested. The system extracted from the EEG signals the following features: five frequency bands, Differential Entropy (DE), Differential Asymmetry (DASM), and Rational Asymmetry (RASM), for each band. Our system then carried out feature selection using a filter method (Mutual Information Matrix), combined with a wrapper process (Chi-Square statistics) and alternatively using the embedded algorithms in a Deep Learning classifier. Finally, this work classified emotions in four quadrants of the circumplex model using Random Forest and Deep Learning algorithms. Our findings show that 1) the proposed emotion elicitation method is useful to provoke affective states associated with trading, 2) the proposed feature selection process improved the classification performance of our emotion recognition system, and 3) classifier performance of the system can recognize trading related emotions and has results comparable with the state of the art research corresponding to a similar number of output classes.

We conducted an experiment that mimics a condition when fake news are evaluated by a person with expert knowledge. Using advanced EEG equipment, we have identified the brain areas involved in the process of verifying message credibility by using full knowledge. Based on experimental data, we have created a machine learning model using generalized logistic regression that achieved 77% accuracy under 10-fold cross-validation.

The hospitals and diagnostic centers normally use manual techniques for the identification of epilepsy. Diagnostic accuracy mostly depend on the expertise of the technician. Researchers around the world are utilizing different methods such as decision tree, support vector machine, artificial neural network, convolutional neural network, etc. for automatic detection and classification of epileptic seizures from EEG. This study aims to devise a deep learning-based approach that will make use of the time-frequency characteristics of one-channel EEG to detect epileptic seizure stages automatically. The time-frequency information of EEG signals was transformed into corresponding Morse CWT scalograms and applied to AlexNet, a well-known convolutional neural network architecture, to train the network. The trained network was able to achieve 97.5%-100% and 95.83%-100% classification accuracy respectively for binary and three-class classification between different classes of the dataset. The effectiveness of this method can be further evaluated by using this approach alongside other epileptic datasets.

Accurate detection of spontaneous seizures using a generalized linear model with external validation	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						focal epilepsy; machine learning; model validation; quantitative EEG; seizure detection	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ALGORITHM; ENTROPY; EEG	Objective Seizure detection is a major facet of electroencephalography (EEG) analysis in neurocritical care, epilepsy diagnosis and management, and the instantiation of novel therapies such as closed-loop stimulation or optogenetic control of seizures. It is also of increased importance in high-throughput, robust, and reproducible pre-clinical research. However, seizure detectors are not widely relied upon in either clinical or research settings due to limited validation. In this study, we create a high-performance seizure-detection approach, validated in multiple data sets, with the intention that such a system could be available to users for multiple purposes. Methods We introduce a generalized linear model trained on 141 EEG signal features for classification of seizures in continuous EEG for two data sets. In the first (Focal Epilepsy) data set consisting of 16 rats with focal epilepsy, we collected 1012 spontaneous seizures over 3 months of 24/7 recording. We trained a generalized linear model on the 141 features representing 20 feature classes, including univariate and multivariate, linear and nonlinear, time, and frequency domains. We tested performance on multiple hold-out test data sets. We then used the trained model in a second (Multifocal Epilepsy) data set consisting of 96 rats with 2883 spontaneous multifocal seizures. Results From the Focal Epilepsy data set, we built a pooled classifier with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.995 and leave-one-out classifiers with an AUROC of 0.962. We validated our method within the independently constructed Multifocal Epilepsy data set, resulting in a pooled AUROC of 0.963. We separately validated a model trained exclusively on the Focal Epilepsy data set and tested on the held-out Multifocal Epilepsy data set with an AUROC of 0.890. Latency to detection was under 5 seconds for over 80% of seizures and under 12 seconds for over 99% of seizures. Significance This method achieves the highest performance published for seizure detection on multiple independent data sets. This method of seizure detection can be applied to automated EEG analysis pipelines as well as closed loop interventional approaches, and can be especially useful in the setting of research using animals in which there is an increased need for standardization and high-throughput analysis of large number of seizures.

A novel seizure detection method based on the deep bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network is proposed in this paper. To preserve the non -stationary nature of EEG signals while decreasing the computational burden, the local mean decomposition (LMD) and statistical feature extraction procedures are introduced. The deep architecture is then designed by combining two independent LSTM networks with the opposite propagation directions: one transmits information from the front to the back, and another from the back to the front. Thus the deep model can take advantage of the information both before and after the currently analyzing moment to jointly determine the output state. A mean sensitivity of 93.61% and a mean specificity of 91.85% were achieved on a long-term scalp EEG database. The comparisons with other published methods based on either traditional machine learning models or convolutional neural networks demonstrated the improved performance for seizure detection.

Adaptive boost LS-SVM classification approach for time-series signal classification in epileptic seizure diagnosis applications	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Epileptic seizure; Health informatics; Electroencephalogram; Covariance; Eigen values; Adaptive Boosting Least Square-Support; Vector Machine; AB-LS-SVM	WAVELET TRANSFORM; AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION; EEG; ENTROPY; STATISTICS	Epileptic seizures are characterised by abnormal neuronal discharge, causing notable disturbances in electrical activities of the human brain. Traditional methods based on manual approaches applied in seizure detection in electroencephalograms (EEG) have drawbacks (e.g., time constraint, lack of effective feature identification relative to disease symptoms and susceptibility to human errors) that can lead to inadequate treatment options. Designing an automated expert system to detect epileptic seizures can proactively support a neurologist's effort to improve authenticity, speed and accuracy of detecting signs of a seizure. We propose a novel two-phase EEG classification technique to detect seizures from EEG by employing covariance matrix coupled with Adaptive Boosting Least Square-Support Vector Machine (i.e., AdaBoost LS-SVM) framework. In first phase, the covariance matrix is employed as a dimensionality reduction tool with feature extraction applied to analyse epileptic patients' EEG records. Initially, each single EEG channel is partitioned into respective k segment with m clusters. Subsequently, covariance matrix is adopted with eigenvalues of each cluster extracted and tested through statistical metrics to identify the most representative, optimally classified features. In the second phase, a robust classifier (i.e., AB-LS-SVM) is proposed to resolve issues of unbalanced data, to detect epileptic events, yielding a high classification accuracy compared to its competing counterparts. The results demonstrates that AB-LS-SVM (optimised by a covariance matrix) is able to achieve satisfactory results (>99% accuracy) for eleven prominent features in EEG signals. The results are compared with state-of-art algorithms (i.e., k-means, SVM, k-nearest neighbour, Random Forest) on identical databases, demonstrating the capability of AB-LS-SVM method as a promising diagnostic tool and its practicality for implementation in seizure detection. The study avers that the proposed approach can aid clinicians in diagnosis or interventions to treat epileptic disease, including a potential use in expert systems where EEG needs to be classified through pattern recognition.

Here, we introduce an all-in-one, wireless, stretchable bioelectronics platform for portable, real-time physiological monitoring and accurate classification biopotentials, including electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and electromyograms (EMG). The nanomembrane sensor and multi-layered electronic system is manufactured by integration of microfabrication techniques, aerosol jet printing of nanoparticles, photonic sintering, and hard-soft materials assembly. Strategic integration with hyperelastic elastomers allows the device to adhere and deform naturally with human body while maintaining the functionalities of the on-board electronics. Stretchable electrodes with optimized structures for intimate skin contact acquire high-quality biopotentials. Comparison of those signals with commercial systems captures the improved performance and significant noise reduction of the stretchable bioelectronics. Implementation of convolutional neural networks for real-time classifications of ECG, EMG, EEG and inertial measurement data demonstrates the feasibility for precise control of external systems. In vivo demonstrations with human subjects in various scenarios reveal the versatility of the device as both a health monitor with real-time cardiac monitoring and a viable human-machine interface.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG) exams can contribute with more reliable data for this analysis. This paper proposes a new approach for the automatic diagnosis of patients with alcoholism. It offers a method for examining the EEG signals from a two-dimensional perspective according to changes in the neural activity, highlighting the influence of high and low-frequency signals. This approach combines Transfer Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to EEG signals analysis. The methodology to evaluate our proposal used 21 combinations of the classification traditional methods and 35 combinations of recent CNN architectures used as feature extractors combined with the following classical classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). CNN MobileNet combined with SVM achieved the best results in Accuracy (95.33%), Precision (95.68%), F1-Score (95.24%), and Recall (95.00%). This combination outperformed traditional methods by up to 8%. Thus, this approach is applicable as a classification stage for computer-aided diagnoses, useful for the triage of patients, and clinical support for the early diagnosis of this disease.

Materials and methods Patients included in the analysis were clinically evaluated with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R). An EEG was performed within the first week after admission to Intensive Rehabilitation Unit (IRU). EEGs were classified according to the ACNS terminology and to the scores of Bagnato and Estraneo. Results A total of 260 patients admitted to the IRU were analysed. A total of 160 patients (61%) improved their consciousness level during IRU stay. EEG score based on the ANCS terminology showed higher overall performance (receiver-operating area under the curve = 0.79) and greater sensitivity (65%), at comparable specificities (80%), for clinical improvement as compared to both CRS-R admission score and other EEG scores. Combining our EEG score with CRS-R score at admission, the cumulative sensitivity increased to 76% when at least one good prognostic index test was present in the same patient, whereas specificity increased up to 93% if both the good prognostic patterns of clinical and instrumental parameters were simultaneously present. Conclusion The EEG scored according to the ACNS terminology is the best among those looked at for the prediction of short-term clinical improvement in patients with DoC and represents a useful instrumental test, complementary to clinical evaluation at admission, to be added in post-acute neurological prognostication methods.

However, long calibration time and lack of enough MI commands limit its use in practice. In order to enlarge the command set, we add the combinations of traditional MI commands as new commands into the command set. We also design an algorithm based on transfer learning so as to decrease the calibration time for collecting EEG signal and training model. We create feature extractor based on data from traditional commands and transfer patterns through the data from new commands. Through the comparison of the average accuracy between our algorithm and traditional algorithms and the visualization of spatial patterns in our algorithm, we find that the accuracy of our algorithm is much higher than traditional algorithms, especially as for the low-quality datasets. Besides, the visualization of spatial patterns is meaningful. The algorithm based on transfer learning takes the advantage of the information from source data. We enlarge the command set while shortening the calibration time, which is of significant importance to the MI-BCI application.

Deep learning approach to detect seizure using reconstructed phase space images	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						epilepsy; reconstructed phase space; convolution neural network; reconstructed phase space image; AlexNet; seizure	RECURRENCE QUANTIFICATION ANALYSIS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURE; AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; ENTROPY	Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the function of the brain in people of all ages. It manifests in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal which records the electrical activity of the brain. Various image processing, signal processing, and machine-learning based techniques are employed to analyze epilepsy, using spatial and temporal features. The nervous system that generates the EEG signal is considered nonlinear and the EEG signals exhibit chaotic behavior. In order to capture these nonlinear dynamics, we use reconstructed phase space (RPS) representation of the signal. Earlier studies have primarily addressed seizure detection as a binary classification (normal vs. ictal) problem and rarely as a ternary class (normal vs. interictal vs. ictal) problem. We employ transfer learning on a pre-trained deep neural network model and retrain it using RPS images of the EEG signal. The classification accuracy of the model for the binary classes is (98.5 +/- 1.5)% and (95 +/- 2)% for the ternary classes. The performance of the convolution neural network (CNN) model is better than the other existing statistical approach for all performance indicators such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The result of the proposed approach shows the prospect of employing RPS images with CNN for predicting epileptic seizures.	[Ilakiyaselvan, N.; Khan, A.

Linear SVM Algorithm Optimization for an EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interface Used by High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder Participants	XV MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING - MEDICON 2019	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDICON)	SEP 26-28, 2019	UNESCO World Heritage Univ, Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Univ Coimbra	UNESCO World Heritage Univ	Brain-computer interface (BCI); EEG; P300; Support vector machine (SVM)	CLASSIFICATION; ATTENTION; P300; P3A	Machine-learning algorithms can be used for data classification on EEG-based Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Here, we used an algorithm based on linear support vector machine (SVM) to identify the presence of the P300 component in datasets from 15 young adult participants with autism spectrum disorder that were provided for the IFMBE Scientific Challenge 2019. We optimized the parameters and inputs for a linear SVM model throughout the ten attempts of the challenge and compared them in terms of accuracy. The highest score (mean accuracy) of 82% was achieved by a procedure that was customized per session per participant. When using a similar procedure for classification model generation and configuration of parameters for all sessions and participants, the highest score achieved was 77%. The results showed that adding data from targets from different calibration sessions from the same participants to the training dataset resulted in a significant increase in accuracy. In all attempts, the mean accuracy was above 70%, which is considered the minimum classification level for the controllability of a BCI. These are promising results for future use of BCIs as a tool for attention training in ASD participants.

J	Freer, D; Yang, GZ				Freer, Daniel; Yang, Guang-Zhong			Data augmentation for self-paced motor imagery classification with C-LSTM	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electroencephalography; deep learning; motor imagery; data augmentation	EEG; NETWORKS	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are becoming important tools for assistive technology, particularly through the use of motor imagery (MI) for aiding task completion. However, most existing methods of MI classification have been applied in a trial-wise fashion, with window sizes of approximately 2 s or more. Application of this type of classifier could cause a delay when switching between MI events. Approach. In this study, state-of-the-art classification methods for motor imagery are assessed offline with considerations for real-time and self-paced control, and a convolutional long-short term memory (C-LSTM) network based on filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) is proposed. In addition, the effects of several methods of data augmentation on different classifiers are explored. Main results. The results of this study show that the proposed network achieves adequate results in distinguishing between different control classes, but both considered deep learning models are still less reliable than a Riemannian MDM classifier. In addition, controlled skewing of the data and the explored data augmentation methods improved the average overall accuracy of the classifiers by 14.0% and 5.3%, respectively. Significance. This manuscript is among the first to attempt combining convolutional and recurrent neural network layers for the purpose of MI classification, and is also one of the first to provide an in-depth comparison of various data augmentation methods for MI classification. In addition, all of these methods are applied on smaller windows of data and with consideration to ambient data, which provides a more realistic test bed for real-time and self-paced control.

As a first step towards a self-paced color-based BCI, we assessed if a machine learning algorithm can learn to distinguish between primary color exposure and idle state. In this paper, we record and analyze the EEG signals from 18 subjects for assessing the feasibility of distinguishing between color exposure and idle states. Specifically, we compare separately the performances obtained in the classification of two different types of idle states (one relaxation-related and another attention-related) and color exposure. We characterize the signals using two different ways based on discrete wavelet transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), respectively. We trained and tested two different classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest. The outcomes provide experimental evidence that a machine learning algoritlun can distinguish between the two classes (exposure to primary colors and idle states), regardless of the kind of idle state analyzed. The more consistent outcomes were obtained using EMD-based features with accuracies of 92.3% and 91.6% (considering a break and an attention-related task as the idle states). Also, when we discard the epochs' onset the performances were 91.8% and 94.6%, respectively.

Mit einem einzelnen Kanal wird jedoch nur ein Teil des gesamten Hirnprozesses erfasst. Fur eine Gehirn-Computer Schnittstelle, die in kurzer Zeit eine Entscheidung treffen muss, ist diese singulare Gehirnantwort haufig unzureichend wogegen die Information aus mehreren Kanalen haufig redundant ist. Beide Vorgehensweisen sind nicht optimal. Daher ist es unser Ziel, die Kanale zu wenigen Komponenten zu kombinieren, die die relevantesten Modulationen eines Hirnprozesses erfassen. Methodik Wir nutzen die kanonische Korrelationsanalyse, um datengetrieben raumliche Filter aus dem EEG zu bestimmen. Mit der Produkt-Moment Korrelation ermitteln wir, auf welche von 12 verschiedenen Stimulussequenzen die Studienteilnehmer geachtet haben. Ergebnisse Die verdeckte Aufmerksamkeit der Studienteilnehmer konnte mit hoher Genauigkeit (89,39,2%) aus dem raumlich gefilterten EEG und signifikant besser als aus einzelnen Kanalen dekodiert werden. Schlussfolgerung Die aus dem EEG erlernten raumlichen Filter ermoglichen die Extraktion von Komponenten, die einen event-korrelierten Gehirnprozess charakterisieren und eine Gehirn-Computer Schnittstelle effektiv steuern konnen, was von hoher Relevanz fur Patienten ist, die nicht mehr anderweitig kommunizieren konnen. Abstract Objective Event-related potentials are commonly calculated in single EEG channels. However, a single channel reflects only a part of the whole brain process. A brain-computer interface must detect a user's intention in short intervals and thus this sparse brain response might be insufficient while information in multiple channels might be redundant. Therefore, our aim was to combine the channels to a few components which reflect the most relevant modulations of a brain process. Methods We applied canonical correlation analysis to determine spatial filters from EEG signals. Using an ordinary correlation measure, we decoded to which of 12 stimulus sequences the participants directed their attention. Results The covert attention of participants was decoded i) with high accuracy (89,3 +/- 9,2%) from spatially filtered EEG signals and ii) significantly better compared to using single channel features. Conclusions The spatial filters, learned from EEG data, permitted the extraction of components characterizing an event-related brain process. Furthermore, they could be effectively used to control a brain-computer interface, which is highly relevant for patients who have lost all other communication abilities.

Hypsarrhythmia is a specific interictal chaotic morphology, and the correct distinction between these two EEG states is crucial to improving the cognitive development of these epileptic patients. The proposed approach was assessed using the proprietary database of Casa Ninar, which contains data regarding children from northeastern Brazil born with microcephaly caused by the Zika virus. We also used data from the CHB-MIT database. Fundamental rhythms of the EEG signal delta, theta, alpha, and beta were analyzed, and then decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform, in which 45 mother wavelet functions were tested to determine the most appropriate function to represent the EEG signals in the hypsarrhythmia interictal and ictal states. We extracted Shannon, Log Energy, Norm, and Sure entropy measures of the subbands as relevant features, and the combinations among them were applied in the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The combination of Sure entropy with Shannon entropy, or with Log Energy and Norm, extracted from the 6 rhythm, allowed for the best linear separability between the classes in most of the classifiers, obtaining 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

In this work, a novel method is proposed based on Joint Approximate Diagonalization (JAD) to optimize stationarity for multiclass motor imagery Brain Computer Interface (BCI) in an information theoretic framework. Specifically, in the proposed method, we estimate the subspace which optimizes the discriminability between the classes and simultaneously preserve stationarity within the motor imagery classes. We determine the subspace for the proposed approach through optimization using gradient descent on an orthogonal manifold. The performance of the proposed stationarity enforcing algorithm is compared to that of baseline One-Versus-Rest (OVR)-CSP and JAD on publicly available BCI competition IV dataset IIa. Results show that an improvement in average classification accuracies across the subjects over the baseline algorithms and thus essence of alleviating within session non-stationarities.

Methods: This retrospective study was comprised of 96 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery, with the final neuropathologic diagnosis of either an FCD or GNTs. Seven classical machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) were employed and trained by our dataset to get the classification model. Ten features [i.e., Gender, Past history, Age at seizure onset, Course of disease, Seizure type, Seizure frequency, Scalp EEG biomarkers, MRI features, Lesion location, Number of antiepileptic drug (AEDs)] were analyzed in our study. Results: We enrolled 56 patients with FCD and 40 patients with GNTs, which included 29 with gangliogliomas (GGs) and 11 with dysembryoplasic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs). Our study demonstrated that the Random Forest-based machine learning model offered the best predictive performance on distinguishing the diagnosis of FCD from GNTs, with an F1-score of 0.9180 and AUC value of 0.9340. Furthermore, the most discriminative factor between FCD and GNTs was the feature "age at seizure onset" with the Chi-square value of 1,213.0, suggesting that patients who had a younger age at seizure onset were more likely to be diagnosed as FCD. Conclusion: The Random Forest-based machine learning classifier can accurately differentiate FCD from GNTs in patients with epilepsy before surgery. This might lead to improved clinician confidence in appropriate surgical planning and treatment outcomes.

In this context, the employment of artificial intelligence methods could be the missing piece to achieve this goal. This work proposed a double-step procedure based on machine learning algorithms and tested it on an intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) dataset available online. The first step aimed to define the optimal length for signal segmentation, allowing for an optimal discrimination of segments with HFO relative to those without. In this case, binary classifiers have been tested on a set of energy features. The second step aimed to classify these segments into ripples, fast ripples and fast ripples occurring during ripples. Results suggest that LDA applied to 10 ms segmentation could provide the highest sensitivity (0.874) and 0.776 specificity for the discrimination of HFOs from no-HFO segments. Regarding the three-class classification, non-linear methods provided the highest values (around 90%) in terms of specificity and sensitivity, significantly different to the other three employed algorithms. Therefore, this machine-learning-based procedure could help clinicians to automatically reduce the quantity of irrelevant data.

A novel method to treat this disorder is to use Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) throughout the patient learns to self-regulate his symptoms by herself. In this context, researches have led to tools aiming to estimate the attention toward these interfaces. In parallel, the democratization of virtual reality (VR) headset, and the fact that it produces valid environments for several aspects: safe, flexible and ecologically valid have led to an increase of its use for BCI application. Another point is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more and more developed in different domain among which medical application. In this paper, we present an innovative method aiming to estimate attention from the measurement of physiological signals: Electroencephalogram (EEG), gaze direction and head movement. This framework is developed to assess attention in VR environments. We propose a novel approach for feature extraction and a dedicated Machine Learning model. The pilot study has been applied on a set of volunteer and our approach presents a lower error rate in comparison with the state of the art methods.

It is most commonly used in the identification of epileptogenic zones in cases of refractory epilepsy. The implanted electrodes generally provide a sparse sampling of a unique set of brain regions including deeper brain structures such as hippocampus, amygdala and insula that cannot be captured by superficial measurement modalities such as electrocorticography (ECoG). Despite the overlapping clinical application and recent progress in decoding of ECoG for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), sEEG has thus far received comparatively little attention for BCI decoding. Additionally, the success of the related deep-brain stimulation (DBS) implants bodes well for the potential for chronic sEEG applications. This article provides an overview of sEEG technology, BCI-related research, and prospective future directions of sEEG for long-term BCI applications.

EEG as the most popular non-invasive brain signal suffers from low signal to noise ratio and unpredictable pattern variation even for the same subject. To improve the classification accuracy of EEG based motor imageries, many deep learning based solutions have been developed, mainly including convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods and recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods. There is no unanimous acknowledgement of the most appropriate deep learning solution for motor imagery classification. In order to evaluate the performance of different deep learning solutions for motor imagery classification, a comprehensive comparison study has been conducted in this paper. CNN based method, RNN based method, temporal convolution network (TCN) based method, paralleled combination of CNN and SRU (Simple Recurrent Unit), cascaded combination of CNN and SRU have been constructed and compared based on extensive experiments. The experiments have been conducted on a fair basis with the same dataset, the same preprocessing of the data, and the same platform. Experiments have shown that TCN based method has obtained the best performance and the paralleled combination of CNN and RNN has obtained the second best performance, which inspired us to explore the spatial-temporal feature learning deep network solutions for further improvement.

Improving the performance of P300 BCI system using different methods	NETWORK MODELING AND ANALYSIS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Brain Computer Interface (BCI); P300 signal; Machine learning algorithms (MLA); Linear discriminant analysis (LDA); Support vector machine (SVM); Linear regression (LREG); Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SINGLE TRIAL EEG; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; FEATURES	A brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used for people with severe physical disabilities such as ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. BCI can allow these individuals to communicate again by creating a new communication channel directly from the brain to an output device. BCI technology can allow paralyzed people to share their intent with others, and thereby demonstrate that direct communication from the brain to the external world is possible, and that it might serve useful functions. In this paper, we propose a system to exploit the P300 signal in the brain, a positive deflection in event-related potentials. The P300 signal can be incorporated into a spelling device. BCI systems include machine learning algorithms (MLA). Their performance depends on the feature extraction and classification techniques employed. This work discusses the performance of different machine learning algorithms. First, a preprocessing step is introduced to the subjects to extract the important features before applying the machine learning algorithms. The presented algorithms are linear discriminant analysis (LDA I and LDA II), support vector machine (SVM I, SVM II, SVM III, and SVM IV), linear regression (LREG), and Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA). It is found that BLDA and SVMIV classifiers yield the highest performance for both subjects considered in our study.

The decoding algorithm of brain signals is a crucial part in BCI, since its performance determines the efficiency of the interface. Decoding performance can be improved by generating optimal feature matrix. The objective of this paper is to propose and implement a decoding algorithm with optimized small dimension feature matrix on identifying motor intention of finger movement using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. An experiment was designed and conducted, in which EEG was acquired from 10 healthy subjects during the left or the right index finger movement. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) topography was analyzed during motor tasks. A degree feature extraction algorithm was proposed based on the graph theory together with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify two kinds of index finger movement, which takes three factors into consideration: frequency bands, amplitude and range of ERD. The results showed that the algorithm can classify the finger movement effectively for 7 subjects based on a three-dimension optimized feature matrix, consisting of the maximum degree, average degree and clustering range. The proposed algorithm is not limited by the size of samples and can indicate the source area of the neural activities. Results also demonstrate that the proposed degree feature extraction algorithm can smooth signal noise and enlarge the feature differences between the contralateral and the ipsilateral hemispheres.

J	Khalaf, A; Akcakaya, M				Khalaf, Aya; Akcakaya, Murat			A probabilistic approach for calibration time reduction in hybrid EEG-fTCD brain-computer interfaces	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article						Hybrid brain-computer interfaces; Transfer learning; Common spatial pattern; Template matching; Wavelet decomposition; Probabilistic fusion	TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER ULTRASOUND	Background Generally, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require calibration before usage to ensure efficient performance. Therefore, each BCI user has to attend a certain number of calibration sessions to be able to use the system. However, such calibration requirements may be difficult to fulfill especially for patients with disabilities. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic transfer learning approach to reduce the calibration requirements of our EEG-fTCD hybrid BCI designed using motor imagery (MI) and flickering mental rotation (MR)/word generation (WG) paradigms. The proposed approach identifies the top similar datasets from previous BCI users to a small training dataset collected from a current BCI user and uses these datasets to augment the training data of the current BCI user. To achieve such an aim, EEG and fTCD feature vectors of each trial were projected into scalar scores using support vector machines. EEG and fTCD class conditional distributions were learnt separately using the scores of each class. Bhattacharyya distance was used to identify similarities between class conditional distributions obtained using training trials of the current BCI user and those obtained using trials of previous users. Results Experimental results showed that the performance obtained using the proposed transfer learning approach outperforms the performance obtained without transfer learning for both MI and flickering MR/WG paradigms. In particular, it was found that the calibration requirements can be reduced by at least 60.43% for the MI paradigm, while at most a reduction of 17.31% can be achieved for the MR/WG paradigm. Conclusions Data collected using the MI paradigm show better generalization across subjects.

We show the ability to enhance phantom limb perception and improve movement decoding through targeted transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in individuals with an arm amputation.Approach.Transcutaneous nerve stimulation experiments were performed with four participants with arm amputation to map phantom limb perception. We measured myoelectric signals during phantom hand movements before and after participants received sensory stimulation. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, we measured the neural activity in sensorimotor regions during phantom movements and stimulation. In one participant, we also tracked sensory mapping over 2 years and movement decoding performance over 1 year.Main results.Results show improvements in the participants' ability to perceive and move the phantom hand as a result of sensory stimulation, which leads to improved movement decoding. In the extended study with one participant, we found that sensory mapping remains stable over 2 years. Sensory stimulation improves within-day movement decoding while performance remains stable over 1 year. From the EEG, we observed cortical correlates of sensorimotor integration and increased motor-related neural activity as a result of enhanced phantom limb perception.Significance.This work demonstrates that phantom limb perception influences prosthesis control and can benefit from targeted nerve stimulation. These findings have implications for improving prosthesis usability and function due to a heightened sense of the phantom hand.

Recently, a least-squares-based auditory attention decoding (AAD) method has been proposed to identify the target speaker from single-trial EEG recordings in an acoustic scenario with two competing speakers. Aiming at enhancing the target speaker and suppressing the interfering speaker and ambient noise, in this article, we propose a cognitive-driven speech enhancement system, consisting of a binaural beamformer which is steered based on AAD and estimated relative transfer function (RTF) vectors, which require estimates of the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) of both speakers. For binaural beamforming and to generate reference signals for AAD, we consider either minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) beamformers or linearly-constrained-minimum-variance (LCMV) beamformers. Contrary to the binaural MVDR beamformer, the binaural LCMV beamformer allows to preserve the spatial impression of the acoustic scene and to control the suppression of the interfering speaker, which is important when intending to switch attention between speakers. The speech enhancement performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of the binaural signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio ($\text {SINR}$) improvement in anechoic and reverberant conditions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of RTF and DOA estimation errors and AAD errors on the speech enhancement performance. The experimental results show that the proposed system using LCMV beamformers yields a larger decoding performance and binaural $\text {SINR}$ improvement compared to using MVDR beamformers.

BCIs often use event-related potentials (ERPs) like the P300 which signals the presence of a target in a stream of stimuli. The P300 and related approaches, however, are inherently limited, as they require many stimulus presentations to obtain a usable control signal. Many approaches depend on gaze direction to focus the target, which is also not a viable approach in many cases, because eye movements might be impaired in potential users. Here we report on a BCI that avoids both shortcomings by decoding spatial target information, independent of gaze shifts.Approach.We present a new method to decode from the electroencephalogram (EEG) covert shifts of attention to one out of four targets simultaneously presented in the left and right visual field. The task is designed to evoke the N2pc component-a hemisphere lateralized response, elicited over the occipital scalp contralateral to the attended target. The decoding approach involves decoding of the N2pc based on data-driven estimation of spatial filters and a correlation measure.Main results.Despite variability of decoding performance across subjects, 22 out of 24 subjects performed well above chance level. Six subjects even exceeded 80% (cross-validated: 89%) correct predictions in a four-class discrimination task. Hence, the single-trial N2pc proves to be a component that allows for reliable BCI control. An offline analysis of the EEG data with respect to their dependence on stimulation time and number of classes demonstrates that the present method is also a workable approach for two-class tasks.Significance.Our method extends the range of strategies for gaze-independent BCI control. The proposed decoding approach has the potential to be efficient in similar applications intended to decode ERPs.

Accurately decoding kinematic information from brain signals is one of the main challenges encountered in the control of human-like robots. In particular, although the forearm of an upper extremity is frequently used in daily life for high-level tasks, only few studies addressed decoding of the forearm movement. In this study, we focus on the classification of forearm movements according to elaborated rotation angles using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To this end, we propose a hierarchical flow convolutional neural network (HF-CNN) model for robust classification. We evaluate the proposed model not only with our experimental dataset but also with a public dataset (BNCI Horizon 2020). The grand-average classification accuracies of three rotation angles yield 0.73 (& x00B1;0.04) for the motor execution (ME) task and 0.65 (& x00B1;0.09) for the motor imagery (MI) task across ten subjects in our experimental dataset. Further, in the public dataset, the grand-averaged classification accuracies were 0.52 (& x00B1;0.03) for ME and 0.51 (& x00B1;0.04) for MI tasks across fifteen subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate the possibility of decoding complex kinematics information using EEG signals. This study will contribute to the development of a brain-controlled robotic arm system capable of performing high-level tasks.

A lot of focus has been done in managing outside attacks of data in organizations. Including Cyber-Physical System (CPS), which is a complex mixture of physical and computer components typically monitored or controlled by computer-based algorithms. However, there has been need to safeguard insider's behavior of breaching the expected code of conduct in maintaining the critical organizations' data and assets. The technology is highly reliable as it cannot be easily fabricated. The analysis of the brainwave signal will be performed using an advanced deep learning algorithm called Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) classifier which will remember a previous mental states of each insider and compare it with new present brain state to classify the risk level associated. The brain wave is also analysed with Adaptive Machine learning Algorithm which combines several weak learners which is decision trees, to form a single strong learner. In this study, our targets is to increase the security of NCI by providing a significant proof of concept system to detect insider threats through fitness evaluation using EEG signals that gets analyzed using deep learning algorithm which will classify different mental states into four categories risk matrix.

It limits the life activity of such patients due to the seizures that occur anytime and anywhere. Thus, creating a monitoring system that could make their life easier and allow them to perform daily life activities as safe as possible has been studied. This paper is a continuity for a project where a system monitors epileptic patients using a set of wearable sensors connected to several processing units, the main sensors are Electroencephalogram (EEG) for the electrical activity of the brain, electrocardiogram (ECG) for the electrical activity of the heart, and accelerometers to monitor the posture of the patient, features extracted from EEG and ECG signals are used for prediction/detection of seizures. Thus, the objective of this paper is to present a comparative study in order to choose the appropriate classification method for seizure prediction and detection. Five classification methods were studied: Decision Trees, Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Ensemble Learning. For each of the classification methods, the accuracy, the specificity, the sensitivity, the precision, the false detection rate and the Fmeasure were studied and compared. The results for seizure prediction system show that the highest accuracy, specificity and F-Measure, and lowest false detection rate were achieved with Bagged Trees Ensemble Learning, the highest sensitivity and precision were achieved with Quadratic Support Vector Machine. However, for seizure detection system, the highest accuracy and F-Measure were achieved with Linear Support Vector, the highest sensitivity and specificity were achieved with Fine Gaussian Support Vector Machine, and the highest precision and lowest false detection rate were achieved with Subspace Discriminant Ensemble Learning.

The hybrid machine learning (HML) classifier can easily classify the subjects (healthy and bruxism), sleep stages (w and REM), and both with high accuracy. 2. The proposed system automatically detects the bruxism sleep disorder and sleep stages. 3. Single C4-A1 channel of the EEG signal found to be more accurate than ECG and EMG channels. Bruxism is a sleep disorder in which the patient clinches and gnashes their teeth. Bruxism detection using traditional methods is time-consuming, cumbersome, and expensive. Therefore, an automatic tool to detect this disorder will alleviate the doctor workload and give valuable help to patients. In this paper, we targeted this goal and designed an automatic method to detect bruxism from the physiological signals using a novel hybrid classifier. We began with data collection. Then, we performed the analysis of the physiological signals and the estimation of the power spectral density. After that, we designed the novel hybrid classifier to enable the detection of bruxism based on these data. The classification of the subjects into "healthy" or "bruxism" from the electroencephalogram channel (C4-A1) obtained a maximum specificity of 92% and an accuracy of 94%. Besides, the classification of the sleep stages such as the wake (w) stage and rapid eye movement (REM) stage from the electrocardiogram channel (ECG1-ECG2) obtained a maximum specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 95%. The combined bruxism classification and the sleep stages classification from the electroencephalogram channel (C4-P4) obtained a maximum specificity of 90% and an accuracy of 97%. The results show that more accurate bruxism detection is achieved by exploiting the electroencephalogram signal (C4-P4). The present work can be applied for home monitoring systems for bruxism detection.

Hand movement is a crucial function for humans' daily life. Developing brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic hand by brain signals would help the severely paralyzed people partially regain the functional independence. Previous intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)-based BMIs towards gesture decoding mostly used neural signals from the primary sensorimotor cortex while ignoring the hand movement related signals from posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Here, we propose combining iEEG recordings from PPC with that from primary sensorimotor cortex to enhance the gesture decoding performance of iEEG-based BMI.Approach. Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals from 25 epilepsy subjects were recorded when they performed a three-class hand gesture task. Across all 25 subjects, we identified 524, 114 and 221 electrodes from three regions of interest (ROIs), including PPC, postcentral cortex (POC) and precentral cortex (PRC), respectively. Based on the time-varying high gamma power (55-150 Hz) of SEEG signal, both the general activation in the task and the fine selectivity to gestures of each electrode in these ROIs along time was evaluated by the coefficient of determinationr(2). According to the activation along time, we further assessed the first activation time of each ROI. Finally, the decoding accuracy for gestures was obtained by linear support vector machine classifier to comparatively explore if the PPC will assist PRC and POC for gesture decoding.Main results. We find that a majority(L:><i60%,R:><i40%) of electrodes in all the three ROIs present significant activation during the task. A large scale temporal activation sequence exists among the ROIs, where PPC activates first, PRC second and POC last. Among the activated electrodes, 15% (PRC), 26% (POC) and 4% (left PPC) of electrodes are significantly selective to gestures. Moreover, decoding accuracy obtained by combining the selective electrodes from three ROIs together is 5%, 3.6%, and 8% higher than that from only PRC and POC when decoding features across, before, and after the movement onset, were used.Significance. This is the first human iEEG study demonstrating that PPC contains neural information about fine hand movement, supporting the role of PPC in hand shape encoding. Combining PPC with primary sensorimotor cortex can provide more information to improve the gesture decoding performance. Our results suggest that PPC could be a rich neural source for iEEG-based BMI. Our findings also demonstrate the early involvement of human PPC in visuomotor task and thus may provide additional implications for further scientific research and BMI applications.

Brandon			Excess brain age in the sleep electroencephalogram predicts reduced life expectancy	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Brain age; Mortality; EEG; Sleep; Life expectancy; Biomarker	MORTALITY	The brain age index (BAI) measures the difference between an individual's apparent "brain age" (BA; estimated by comparing EEG features during sleep from an individual with age norms), and their chronological age (CA); that is BAI = BA-CA. Here, we evaluate whether BAI predicts life expectancy. Brain age was quantified using a previously published machine learning algorithm for a cohort of participants >= 40 years old who underwent an overnight sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) as part of the Sleep Heart Health Study (n = 4877). Excess brain age (BAI >0) was associated with reduced life expectancy (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.12, [1.03,1.21], p = 0.002). Life expectancy decreased by -0.81 [-1.44, -0.24] years per standard-deviation increase in BAL Our findings show that BAI, a sleep EEG-based biomarker of the deviation of sleep microstructure from patterns normal for age, is an independent predictor of life expectancy.

Since the advent of computational psychiatry, research based on functional magnetic resonance imaging has yielded remarkable results, but these tools tend to be too expensive for everyday clinical use. Objective: This review focuses on an affordable data-driven approach based on electroencephalographic recordings. Web-based applications via public or private cloud-based platforms would be a logical next step. We aim to compare several different approaches to the detection of depression from electroencephalographic recordings using various features and machine learning models. Methods: To detect depression, we reviewed published detection studies based on resting-state electroencephalogram with final machine learning, and to predict therapy outcomes, we reviewed a set of interventional studies using some form of stimulation in their methodology. Results: We reviewed 14 detection studies and 12 interventional studies published between 2008 and 2019. As direct comparison was not possible due to the large diversity of theoretical approaches and methods used, we compared them based on the steps in analysis and accuracies yielded. In addition, we compared possible drawbacks in terms of sample size, feature extraction, feature selection, classification, internal and external validation, and possible unwarranted optimism and reproducibility. In addition, we suggested desirable practices to avoid misinterpretation of results and optimism. Conclusions: This review shows the need for larger data sets and more systematic procedures to improve the use of the solution for clinical diagnostics. Therefore, regulation of the pipeline and standard requirements for methodology used should become mandatory to increase the reliability and accuracy of the complete methodology for it to be translated to modern psychiatry.

The present study aimed to verify the efficiency of motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) control of continuous passive motion (CPM) in the recovery of wrist extension due to stroke. An observational study was conducted in 26 chronic stroke patients, aged 49.0 +/- 15.4 years, with upper extremity motor impairment. All patients showed no wrist extension recovery. A 24-channel highresolution electroencephalogram (EEG) system was used to acquire cortical signal while they were imagining extension of the affected wrist. Then, 20 sessions of BCI-driven CPM training were carried out for 6 weeks. Primary outcome was the increase of active range of motion (ROM) of the affected wrist from the baseline to final evaluation. Improvement of modified Barthel Index, EEG classification and motor imagery pattern of wrist extension were recorded as secondary outcomes. Twenty-one patients finally passed the EEG screening and completed all the BCI-driven CPM trainings. From baseline to the final evaluation, the increase of active ROM of the affected wrists was (24.05 +/- 14.46)degrees. The increase of modified Barthel Index was 3.10 +/- 4.02 points. But no statistical difference was detected between the baseline and final evaluations (P > 0.05). Both EEG classification and motor imagery pattern improved. The present study demonstrated beneficial outcomes of MI-based BCI control of CPM training in motor recovery of wrist extension using motor imagery signal of brain in chronic stroke patients.

Therefore, it is imperative to identify how a person is cognitively engaging specially in tasks such as information acquisition and studying. Given the surge in online education system, this even becomes more important as the visual feedback of student engagement is missing from the loop. To address this issue, the current study proposes a pipeline to detect cognitive performance by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using bidirectional multilayer long-short term memory (BML-LSTM). Tested on an EEG brainwave dataset from 10 students while they watched massive open online course video clips, the obtained results using BML-LSTM show an accuracy >95% in detecting cognitive performance which outperforms all previous methods applied on the same dataset.

In this report, we describe an open access multi-subject dataset for MI of different joints from the same limb. This experiment collected data from twenty-five healthy subjects on three tasks: 1) imagining the movement of right hand, 2) imagining the movement of right elbow, and 3) keeping resting with eyes open, which results in a total of 22,500 trials. The dataset provided includes data of three stages: 1) raw recorded data, 2) pre-processed data after operations such as artifact removal, and 3) trial data that can be directly used for feature extraction and classification. Different researchers can reuse the dataset according to their needs. We expect that this dataset will facilitate the analysis of brain activation patterns of the same limb and the study of decoding techniques for MI.

Nonhuman primate findings have shown that decision-making implicates modulations in unit firing rates and local field potentials (LFPs) across frontal and parietal cortices. Yet the electrophysiological brain mechanisms that underlie free choice in humans remain ill defined. Here, we address this question using rare intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in surgical epilepsy patients performing a delayed oculomotor decision task. We find that the temporal dynamics of high-gamma (HG, 60-140 Hz) neural activity in distinct frontal and parietal brain areas robustly discriminate free choice from instructed saccade planning at the level of single trials. Classification analysis was applied to the LFP signals to isolate decision-related activity from sensory and motor planning processes. Compared with instructed saccades, free-choice trials exhibited delayed and longer-lasting HG activity during the delay period. The temporal dynamics of the decision-specific sustained HG activity indexed the unfolding of a deliberation process, rather than memory maintenance. Taken together, these findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence in humans for the role of sustained high-frequency neural activation in frontoparietal cortex in mediating the intrinsically driven process of freely choosing among competing behavioral alternatives.

Methods: PAC patterns observed in intracerebral electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings were retrospectively studied during seizures of seven patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. The time locked index (TLI) measure was introduced to quantify the degree of harmonicity between frequency bands associated to the emergence of PAC during epileptic seizures. Results: (1) Harmonic and non harmonic PAC patterns coexist during the seizure dynamics in iEEG recordings with macroelectrodes. (2) Harmonic PAC patterns are an emergent property of the periodic non sinusoidal waveform constituting the epileptiform activity. (3) The TLI metric allows to distinguish the non harmonic PAC pattern, which has been previously associated with the ictal core through the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts mechanism of seizure propagation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the spectral harmonicity of the ictal activity plays a relevant role in the visual analysis of the iEEG recordings performed by the epileptologists to define the SOZ, and that it should be considered for the proper interpretation of ictal mechanisms. Significance: The proposed harmonicity analysis can be used to improve the delineation of the SOZ by reliably identifying non harmonic PAC patterns emerging from fully recruited cortical and subcortical areas.

EEG signals differ from one subject to another and even for the same subject among different trials, and this is why designing a general classification model is still debated. Deep learning is dominant in so many fields like computer vision and natural language processing but it is still under investigation for EEG signals classification. We followed a new trend in EEG signals classification in which these signals are transformed into images, and so classifying such signals become an image classification problem where Deep learning can work well. The Physionet dataset for EEG motor movement/imagery tasks was used which consists of 109 subjects and the motor imagery EEG signals for three frequency bands (Delta [0.5-4 Hz], Mu [8-13 Hz], and Beta [13-30 Hz]) was transformed into 3-channel images (one channel for each band) using the Azimuthal equidistant projection and Clough-Tocher algorithm for interpolation. These 2-D images represent the input data to our model which consists of Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to extract the spatial and frequency features followed by Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to extract temporal features and then finally to be classified into 5 different classes (4 motor imagery tasks and one rest). Our results were promising (70.64% average accuracy) and 5% better than the results of Support Vector Machine (SVM) method over the same dataset. We noticed that taking Delta band into account increases the classification accuracy by 2.51%.

However, the communication between users and BCI systems through artificial matching is a critical issue. Recently, BCIs have been developed to adopt intuitive decoding, which is the key to solving several problems such as a small number of classes and manually matching BCI commands with device control. Unfortunately, the advances in this area have been slow owing to the lack of large and uniform datasets. This study provides a large intuitive dataset for 11 different upper extremity movement tasks obtained during multiple recording sessions. The dataset includes 60-channel electroencephalography, 7-channel electromyography, and 4-channel electro-oculography of 25 healthy participants collected over 3-day sessions for a total of 82,500 trials across all the participants. Findings: We validated our dataset via neurophysiological analysis. We observed clear sensorimotor de-/activation and spatial distribution related to real-movement and motor imagery, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the consistency of the dataset by evaluating the classification performance of each session using a baseline machine learning method. Conclusions: The dataset includes the data of multiple recording sessions, various classes within the single upper extremity, and multimodal signals. This work can be used to (i) compare the brain activities associated with real movement and imagination, (ii) improve the decoding performance, and (iii) analyze the differences among recording sessions. Hence, this study, as a Data Note, has focused on collecting data required for further advances in the BCI technology.

However, the neural correlation of this proposed difference in neural representations of familiar and unfamiliar identities remains unclear. New methods of EEG data analysis, functional networks and time frequency analyses, are highly recommended to advance the knowledge of those brain mechanisms. Developing an EEG based pattern recognition system could potentially be used to improve the current person recognition strategies. In this study, we designed a multi-channel EEG based pattern recognition system for person recognition. To do this, a new feature extraction method combining directed functional network analysis and signal complexity of EEGs from different brain regions was proposed, which is the main contribution of this paper. The proposed method was tested in an experiment of 20 subjects underlying visual and auditory stimuli simultaneously. The features were calculated in delta, theta, alpha and beta band respectively, then SVM and KNN classifiers were applied to these feature sets and the results showed the recognition accuracies of these four bands are relatively stable with the best accuracy of 90.58% in delta band for SVM. In addition, theta and alpha band also showed good performance for the two classifiers. It indicated delta wave is the best sub band for person perception and SVM is better than KNN in this system. This work is the first time to construct the directed functional network in person recognition study, and it demonstrated the combination of non-linear complexities and network features are efficient for EEG based expert and intelligent system for person recognition.

To integrate the brain's holistic motion intention with sEMG's control reliability for lower-limb motion neurorehabilitation with the exoskeleton, an ingenious hierarchical fusion strategy based on EEG and sEMG for ambulation with obstacle crossing task was proposed. Specifically, EEG delivers senior task-specific commands to execute refined locomotion while the specific implementation is determined by sEMG. The practical feasibility of ridge regression-based EEG decoding was proved firstly via offline and online methods involving 3 subjects, with subsequent online verification of the proposed strategy yielding higher than 85% of average accuracy. Furthermore, one subject was invited to wear the exoskeleton for the practical application of the strategy.

For the automatic detection of interictal epileptiform potentials sensitivities range from 65 to 99% with false positive detections of 0,09 to 13,4 per minute. Recent studies documented equal or even better performance of automatic spike detection programs compared with experienced human EEG readers. The seizure detection problem - one of the major problems in clinical epileptology - consists of the fact that the majority of focal onset seizures with impaired awareness and of seizures arising out of sleep occur unnoticed by patients and their caregivers. Automatic seizure detection systems could facilitate objective seizure documentation and thus help to solve the seizure detection problem. Furthermore, seizure detection systems may help to prevent seizure-related injuries and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and could be an integral part of novel, seizure-triggered on-demand therapies in epilepsy. During long-term video-EEG monitoring seizure detection systems could improve patient safety, provide a time-saving objective and reproducible analysis of seizure patterns and facilitate automatic computer-based patient testing during seizures. Sensitivities of seizure detection systems range from 75 to 90% with extratemporal seizures being more difficult to detect than temporal seizures. The false positive alarm rate ranges from 0,1 to 5 per hour. Finally, machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning approaches, open a new highly promising era in automatic spike and seizure detection.

Decoding non-linearity for effective extraction of the eye-blink artifact pattern from EEG recordings	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Ocular artifact; Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition; Kernel Principal Component Analysis; kernel function; Electroencephalogram	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; SUPPRESSION; REMOVAL; ICA	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement of electrical signal on the scalp originated due to neuronal activity. EEG signals associated with cortical activity are orders of magnitude lower in amplitude compared to other parasitic signals such as eye-blink artifacts, which contaminate the recorded EEG data making it imperative for the investigators to adopt an effective artifact suppression strategy. In all the previous studies, suppression of the pattern related to the artifacts was performed based on the assumption of a linear interaction between the source of artifact (eye-blink) and the brain signal (EEG data). This paper presents a novel methodology by considering the non-linear interaction between the artifact signal associated with the eye-blink and the contaminated EEG data using kernel functions. In the present work, adaptive data-driven approach called Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is hybridized with kernel Principal Component Analysis (kPCA) to decode the non-linear interaction. The contaminated segment of EEG data is decomposed by the EEMD technique into a series of basic building blocks called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The features of the eye-blink signals are captured by some of these IMFs; subsequently, effective extraction of the ocular artifact from the IMFs is performed by kPCA using non-linear kernel functions (radial basis function, second and third-order polynomial function). In the present study, technique used for artifact suppression relies on the extraction of ocular artifact signal from IMFs based on optimizing the different parameters of the kPCA. Compared with other techniques used in previous studies, the proposed method (based on third-order polynomial kernel function) is capable of effectively extracting the pattern related to the ocular artifacts from the single channel contaminated EEG data with low distortion of the EEG signal.

Comparison of parametric and nonparametric methods for outcome prediction using longitudinal data after cardiac arrest	RESUSCITATION			English	Article						Cardiac arrest; Prognostication; Electroencephalography; Data; Analytics; Precision medicine	LATENT CLASS MODELS; ASSOCIATION; RESUSCITATION; CARE	Introduction: Predicting outcome after cardiac arrest is challenging. We previously tested group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) for prognostication based on baseline characteristics and quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) trajectories. Here, we describe implementation of this method in a freely available software package and test its performance against alternative options. Methods: We included comatose patients admitted to a single center after resuscitation from cardiac arrest from April 2010 to April 2019 who underwent >= 6 h of EEG monitoring. We abstracted clinical information from our prospective registry and summarized suppression ratio in 48 hourly epochs. We tested three classes of longitudinal models: frequentist, statistically based GBTMs; non-parametric (i.e. machine learning) k-means models; and Bayesian regression. Our primary outcome of interest was discharge CPC 1-3 (vs unconsciousness or death). We compared sensitivity for detecting poor outcome at a false positive rate (FPR) <1%. Results: Of 1,010 included subjects, 250 (25%) were awake and alive at hospital discharge. GBTM and k-means derived trajectories, group sizes and group-specific outcomes were comparable. Conditional on an FPR < 1%, GBTMs yielded optimal sensitivity (38%) over 48 h. More sensitive methods had 2-3 % FPRs. Conclusion: We explored fundamentally different tools for patient-level predictions based on longitudinal and time-invariant patient data. Of the evaluated methods, GBTM resulted in optimal sensitivity while maintaining a false positive rate <1%. The provided code and software of this method provides an easy-to-use implementation for outcome prediction based on GBTMs.	[Elmer, Jonathan] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Elmer, Jonathan] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Crit Care Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Elmer, Jonathan] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Jones, Bobby L.] UPMC, Western Psychiat Inst & Clin, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Nagin, Daniel S.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA		Elmer, J (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.; Elmer, J (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Crit Care Med, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.; Elmer, J (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.	elmerjp@upmc.edu			NINDS NIH HHS [K23 NS097629] Funding Source: Medline	NINDS NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))			24	5	5	1	3	ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD	CLARE	ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND	0300-9572	1873-1570		RESUSCITATION	Resuscitation	MAR 1	2020	148						152	160		10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.01.020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2020.01.020			9	Critical Care Medicine; Emergency Medicine	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	General & Internal Medicine; Emergency Medicine	KQ3OX	32004661	Green Accepted			2022-08-02	WOS:000516837300021

It is realized by using the biomedical implants that are connected to the cloud. A framework for the precise and effective diagnosis of epileptic seizures is designed in this context. To achieve real-time compression and effective signal processing and transmission, it uses an intelligent event-driven electroencephalogram (EEG) signal acquisition. Experimental results show that grace of the event-driven nature an overall 3.3 fold compression and transmission bandwidth usage reduction is achieved by the devised method compared to the conventional counterparts. It promises a notable decrease in the post analysis and classification processing activity. The system performance is studied by using a standard three class EEG epileptic seizure dataset. The highest classification accuracy of 97.5% is secured for a mono-class. The best average classification accuracy of 96.4% is attained for three-classes. Comparison of the system with classical equivalents is made. Results demonstrate more than threefold and sevenfold of outperformance respectively in terms of compression gain and processing efficiency while confirming a comparable classification precision.

Such interpretation is usually performed by supervised classifiers constructed in training sessions. However, changes in cognitive states of the user, such as alertness and vigilance, during test sessions lead to variations in EEG patterns, causing classification performance decline in BCI systems. This research focuses on effects of alertness on the performance of motor imagery (MI) BCI as a common mental control paradigm. It proposes a new protocol to predict MI performance decline by alertness-related pre-trial spatio-spectral EEG features. The proposed protocol can be used for adapting the classifier or restoring alertness based on the cognitive state of the user during BCI applications.

We assumed that more discriminative features can be captured if spatial filters maximize the independence of each class data. This study constructed spatial filters named multiclass common spatial pattern (CSP), which maximize an approximation of mutual information of extracted components and class labels, and applied them to a five-class motor-imagery dataset containing finger motion tasks. By applying multiclass CSP, the classification accuracies were improved (Mean +/- SD: 40.6 +/- 10.1%) compared with classical CSP (21.8 +/- 2.5%) and no spatial filtering case (38.7 +/- 10.0%). In addition, we visualized learned spatial filters to assess the trend of discriminative features of finger motions. For these results, it was clear that multiclass CSP captured task-specific spatial maps for each finger motion and outperformed multiclass motor-imagery classification performance about 2% even when the tasks are small-scale physical dynamics.

Adaptation of Common Spatial Patterns based on mental fatigue for motor-imagery BCI	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-Computer Interface; Motor imagery; Electroencephelogram; Common Spatial Patterns; Adaptation; Mental fatigue	CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is the most popular method in motor imagery (MI) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BO) for extracting features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Due to the non-stationary nature of EEG signals, the CSP computed on the training data may not be optimal for the evaluation data. One of the major causes of such non-stationarity is the change in user's cognitive state due to fatigue, frustration, low arousal level, etc. This paper proposes an adaptive scheme for the CSP based on the mental fatigue of the user. The proposed method uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) active learning to adapt the CSP. Breaking ties criterion is used for selecting samples from the evaluation data. The separability of MI EEG features extracted with the proposed adaptive CSP has been compared with that of conventional CSP in terms of three separability metrics: Davies Bouldin Index (DBI), Fisher's Score (FS) and Dunn's Index (DI). Experimental results show significantly higher separability of features extracted with adaptive CSP as compared to that with conventional CSP. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective score from initial interview identifies patients with probable dissociative seizures	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Functional seizures; Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures; Clinical decision support tool; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence	PSYCHOGENIC NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; ICTAL CHARACTERISTICS; DIAGNOSTIC DELAY; VIDEO-EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; COMORBIDITIES; MANAGEMENT	Objective: To develop a Dissociative Seizures Likelihood Score (DSLS), which is a comprehensive, evidence-based tool using information available during the first outpatient visit to identify patients with "probable" dissociative seizures (DS) to allow early triage to more extensive diagnostic assessment. Methods: Based on data from 1616 patients with video-electroencephalography (vEEG) confirmed diagnoses, we compared the clinical history from a single neurology interview of patients in five mutually exclusive groups: epileptic seizures (ES), DS, physiologic nonepileptic seizure-like events (PSLE), mixed DS plus ES, and inconclusive monitoring. We used data-driven methods to determine the diagnostic utility of 76 features from retrospective chart review and applied this model to prospective interviews. Results: The DSLS using recursive feature elimination (RFE) correctly identified 77% (95% confidence interval (CI), 74-80%) of prospective patients with either ES or DS, with a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 84%. This accuracy was not significantly inferior than neurologists' impression (84%, 95% CI: 80-88%) and the kappa between neurologists' and the DSLS was 21% (95% CI: 1-41%). Only 3% of patients with DS were missed by both the fellows and our score (95% CI 0-11%). Significance: The evidence-based DSLS establishes one method to reliably identify some patients with probable DS using clinical history. The DSLS supports and does not replace clinical decision making. While not all patients with DS can be identified by clinical history alone, these methods combined with clinical judgement could be used to identify patients who warrant further diagnostic assessment at a comprehensive epilepsy center.

It is worth noting that the application of BCI is not limited to medical applications, and hence, the research in this field has gained due attention. Moreover, the significant number of related publications over the past two decades further indicates the consistent improvements and breakthroughs that have been made in this particular field. Nonetheless, it is also worth mentioning that with these improvements, new challenges are constantly discovered. This article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of a complete BCI system. First, a brief overview of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI systems is given. Secondly, a considerable number of popular BCI applications are reviewed in terms of electrophysiological control signals, feature extraction, classification algorithms, and performance evaluation metrics. Finally, the challenges to the recent BCI systems are discussed, and possible solutions to mitigate the issues are recommended.

We developed a propositional artificial intelligence (AI) system based on the above concepts to support physicians in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Methods: We analyzed and built ontology knowledge for the classification of seizure patterns, epilepsy, epilepsy syndrome, and etiologies. Protege ontology tool was applied in this study. In order to enable the system to be close to the inferential thinking of clinical experts, we classified and constructed knowledge of other epilepsy-related knowledge, including comorbidities, epilepsy imitators, epilepsy descriptors, characteristic electroencephalography (EEG) findings, treatments, etc. We used the Ontology Web Language with Description Logic (OWL-DL) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to design rules for expressing the relationship between these ontologies. Results: Dravet syndrome was taken as an illustration for epilepsy syndromes implementation. We designed an interface for the physician to enter the various characteristics of the patients. Clinical data of an 18-year-old boy with epilepsy was applied to the AI system. Through SWRL and reasoning engine Drool's execution, we successfully demonstrate the process of differential diagnosis. Conclusion: We developed a propositional AI system by using the OWL-DL/SWRL approach to deal with the complexity of current epilepsy diagnosis. The experience of this system, centered on the clinical epilepsy syndromes, paves a path to construct an AI system for further complicated epilepsy diagnosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Commercially available anesthetic state monitors perform poorly when ketamine is administered as an anesthetic-analgesic adjunct. Poor performance is likely because the models underlying these monitors are not optimized for the electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations that are unique to the co-administration of ketamine.Approach.In this work, we designed twok-nearest neighbors algorithms for anesthetic state prediction.Main results.The first algorithm was trained only on sevoflurane EEG data, making it sevoflurane-specific. This algorithm enabled discrimination of the sevoflurane general anesthesia (GA) state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.87, [95% CI, 0.76, 0.97]). However, it did not enable discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.43, [0.19, 0.67]). In our second algorithm, we implemented a cross drug training paradigm by including both sevoflurane and sevoflurane-plus-ketamine EEG data in our training set. This algorithm enabled discrimination of the sevoflurane-plus-ketamine GA state from sedated and awake states (true positive rate = 0.91, [0.84, 0.98]).Significance.Instead of a one-algorithm-fits-all-drugs approach to anesthetic state monitoring, our results suggest that drug-specific models are necessary to improve the performance of automated anesthetic state monitors.

Decoding hand movements from human EEG to control a robotic arm in a simulation environment	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						movement-related cortical potential; MRCP; grasping; brain-computer interface; BCI; simulation environment; movement decoding	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CLASSIFICATION; GRASP; NEUROPROSTHESES	Objective. Daily life tasks can become a significant challenge for motor impaired persons. Depending on the severity of their impairment, they require more complex solutions to retain an independent life. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are targeted to provide an intuitive form of control for advanced assistive devices such as robotic arms or neuroprostheses. In our current study we aim to decode three different executed hand movements in an online BCI scenario from electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Approach. Immersed in a desktop-based simulation environment, 15 non-disabled participants interacted with virtual objects from daily life by an avatar's robotic arm. In a short calibration phase, participants performed executed palmar and lateral grasps and wrist supinations. Using this data, we trained a classification model on features extracted from the low frequency time domain. In the subsequent evaluation phase, participants controlled the avatar's robotic arm and interacted with the virtual objects in case of a correct classification. Main results. On average, participants scored online 48% of all movement trials correctly (3-condition scenario, adjusted chance level 40%, alpha = 0.05). The underlying movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) of the acquired calibration data show significant differences between conditions over contralateral central sensorimotor areas, which are retained in the data acquired from the online BCI use. Significance. We could show the successful online decoding of two grasps and one wrist supination movement using low frequency time domain features of the human EEG. These findings can potentially contribute to the development of a more natural and intuitive BCI-based control modality for upper limb motor neuroprostheses or robotic arms for people with motor impairments.

Stress monitoring and management, with the aim to analyze or mitigate the effects of stress, are an active area of research. A promising approach for detecting stress is by measuring bio-signals such as an electroencephalogram (EEG) or an electrocardiogram (ECG). In this study, we introduce a wearable in- and over-ear device that measures EEG and ECG signals simultaneously. The device is composed of dry and soft sensing electrodes which are conformally integrated on the surface of earbuds. We carried out a pilot study exposing test subjects to three standard stressors (stroop, memory search, and mental arithmetic) while measuring their EEG and ECG signals. Preliminary results indicate the feasibility of classifying various stress conditions using a convolutional neural network.

The aim of this study is to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of HFOs in channel-wise instead of event-level as usual and to develop an automated the seizure onset zone (SOZ) identification by using a support vector machine (SVM) approach on the channel-wise features in a short-term recording. In this work, five consecutive patients with medically intractable epilepsy were enrolled. For each patient, ten-minute segments were defined from two hours of iEEG recordings during sleep state. A total of 17 channel-wise features including 6 rate-based, 6 duration-based, 3 amplitude-based, and 2 power-based features of HFOs were extracted from each 10-min segment, which including ripples (Rs, 80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (FRs, 250-500Hz) were detected automatically using validated detectors. Each channel-wise feature was ranked by using the Student & x2019;s <italic>t-test</italic> method and the most distinctive features were selected to explore the characteristics of HFOs in each channel. A supervised-learning based SVM classifier with the selected channel-wise features or their combinations was developed to identify each channel within the independently clinician-defined SOZ or not. Over 3,816 chanel-10-min segments of iEEG recordings, the evaluated accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the proposed approach with the optimal combination of top five ranked features for SOZ identification are 86.6 & x0025;, 73.0 & x0025;, and 94.1 & x0025;, respectively, for ten-fold cross-validation, and 86.0 & x0025;, 79.2 & x0025;, and 91.8 & x0025;, respectively, for the leave-1-out cross-validation. Compared with the recently reported SOZ detectors based on event-wise feature of HFOs, the channel-wise features and the combination with machine learning approach demonstrate its feasibility in SOZ identification with a relative higher performance and potentially reduce the time needed currently for long-term recording and manual inspection.

J	Marathe, M				Marathe, Megh			Seizure aesthetics: Temporal regimes and medical technology in epilepsy diagnosis	TIME & SOCIETY			English	Article						Epilepsy; aesthetics; seizure; disability studies; electroencephalography; diagnosis; design; ethnography; time; hospital	ILAE COMMISSION; POSITION PAPER; CLASSIFICATION	Epilepsy is a neurological condition defined by time; it is characterized by a lifelong tendency for recurrent, unpredictable, and unprovoked seizures, during which people lose control over parts of body-mind function. Diagnosing seizures involves using electroencephalograms to represent and classify brain waves in relation to clock time. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork in a North American teaching hospital, this paper shows that as neurologists learn to diagnose seizures, they internalize clock time norms for normal and abnormal brain waves. The paper demonstrates how these temporal norms work to assign a set of aesthetics to brain waves: patterns that conform to clock-time norms are beautiful, whereas hard-to-classify patterns are ugly. These aesthetic judgments follow diagnostically complex patients in future hospital visits, who become known, for instance, as "the patient with the ugly EEG." The paper critiques this ascription of labels to patients and situates the role of the electroencephalogram's clock time in this predicament. It concludes with a speculative design project that reorients the relationship between temporality and embodiment by using the heartbeat as a situated and co-produced alternative to the standardized and invariant clock. Ultimately, the paper argues that the aesthetics of medical technology are fundamental to clinical care, thereby opening up new directions for research at the intersection of critical time studies and disability studies.

After having tested the difference between a classical EEG recorder with electroconductive gel (ANT system) and the MUSE EEG headband, we studied the BCI performances of the later during the control of a small robot. We demonstrated that the participants were able to successfully control the robot using an online brain-computer interface based on the signal power in different frequency bands (delta, theta and alpha) characterizing the eyes-opened and relaxed eyes-closed states. Additionally, we performed a correlation analysis which demonstrated that the BCI commands were more related to a delta or theta power decrease for the determination of the classifier output probability and to the alpha power increase for the speed control of the robot.

One common ERP technique used in cognition research is the oddball paradigm where the brain's response to common and uncommon stimuli is compared. The neurologic response to the oddball paradigm produces a P300 ERP which is one of the major visual/auditory sensory ERP components. The purpose of this study to classify ERP responses to common and uncommon tones by extracting the P300 feature from ERP epochs and identify the accurate shape of the P300 wave. For recording ERP data, and OpenBCI system is used. P300 features are extracted using EEGlab which is a mathematical tool of MATLAB. Finally, various types of machine learning models are used for identifying the accurate shape of a P300 wave and then classifying common and uncommon auditory tones. For stimuli classification, all of the algorithms evaluated performed efficiently and built a consistent model with 93.75% to 99.1% evaluation accuracy. Also, for P300 shape detection, NN model showed the best performance with 94.95% accuracy. These findings have the potential to add useful machine learning-based methods to the clinical application of ERPs.

The experiment was conducted on 7 PD patients who performed a total of 14 MI-BCI sessions targeting lower extremities. EEG was recorded during the initial calibration phase of each session, and the specific BCI models were produced by using Spectrally weighted Common Spatial Patterns (SpecCSP), Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) and Filter-Bank Common Spatial Patterns (FBCSP) methods. The results showed that FBCSP outperformed SPoC in terms of accuracy, and both SPoC and SpecCSP in terms of the false-positive ratio. The study also demonstrates that PD patients were capable of operating MI-BCI, although with lower accuracy.

The Autoregressive Linear Mixture Model: A Time-Series Model for an Instantaneous Mixture of Network Processes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Brain modeling; Machine learning; Data models; Computational modeling; Mathematical model; Signal processing algorithms; Mixture models; Time series analysis; autoregressive processes; mixture models; unsupervised learning; electroencephalography	MATRIX-FACTORIZATION; ALGORITHMS; NONCONVEX	Vector autoregressive models provide a simple generative model for multivariate, time-series data. The autoregressive coefficients of the vector autoregressive model describe a network process. However, in real-world applications such as macroeconomics or neuroimaging, time-series data arise not from isolated network processes but instead from the simultaneous occurrence of multiple network processes. Standard vector autoregressive models cannot provide insights about the underlying structure of such time-series data. In this work, we present the autoregressive linear mixture (ALM) model. The ALM proposes a decomposition of time-series data into co-occurring network processes that we call autoregressive components. We also present a non-convex likelihood-based estimator for fitting the ALM model and show that it can be solved using the proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm. We validate the ALM on both synthetic and real-world electroencephalography data, showing that we can disambiguate task-relevant autoregressive components that correspond with distinct network processes.

Four different types of experimental tasks related to humming has been designed and exploited here. They are: (i) non-task specific (NTS), (ii) motor task (MT), (iii) VIm task, and (iv) VInt task. EEG signals from seventeen participants for each of these tasks were recorded from 16 electrode locations on the scalp and its features were extracted and analysed using common spatial pattern (CSP) filter. These features were subsequently fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification. This analysis aimed to perform a binary classification, predicting whether the subject was performing one task or the other. Results from an extensive analysis showed a mean classification accuracy of 88.9% for VIm task and 91.1% for VInt task. This study clearly shows that VIm can be classified with ease and is a viable paradigm to integrate in BCIs. Such systems are not only useful for people with speech problems, but in general for people who use BCI systems to help them out in their everyday life, giving them another dimension of system control.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology based on motor imagery (MI) control has become a research hotspot but continues to encounter numerous challenges. BCI can assist in the recovery of stroke patients and serve as a key technology in robot control. Current research on MI almost exclusively focuses on the hands, feet, and tongue. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish a four-class MI BCI system, in which the four types are the four articulations within the right upper limbs, involving the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand. Approach. Ten subjects were chosen to perform nine upper-limb analytic movements, after which the differences were compared in P300, movement-related potentials(MRPS), and event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization under voluntary MI (V-MI) and involuntary MI (INV-MI). Next, the cross-frequency coupling (CFC) coefficient based on mutual information was extracted from the electrodes and frequency bands with interest. Combined with the image Fourier transform and twin bounded support vector machine classifier, four kinds of electroencephalography data were classified, and the classifier's parameters were optimized using a genetic algorithm. Main results. The results were shown to be encouraging, with an average accuracy of 93.2% and 92.2% for V-MI and INV-MI, respectively, and over 95% for any three classes and any two classes. In most cases, the accuracy of feature extraction using the proximal articulations as the basis was found to be relatively high and had better performance. Significance. This paper discussed four types of MI according to three aspects under two modes and classed them by combining graph Fourier transform and CFC. Accordingly, the theoretical discussion and classification methods may provide a fundamental theoretical basis for BCI interface applications.

The main goal of the proposed solution is to realize a fast-neural interface, while preserving high accuracy and reliability values. The proposed BCI exploits signals from n=8 EEG channels along the sensorimotor area. In this respect, it has been developed an ad hoc protocol to elicit a specific brain activity pattern: the Movement Related Potential (MRPs). EEG data undergo an innovative FE methodology known in the image-processing field as Local Binary Patterning (LBP), which analytically transforms experimental measurements into a series of binary strings. The LBP method reduces FE stage the computation complexity and timing, speeding up the real-time classification stages. The features from the LBP stage are used to train and feed a Serial Support Vector Machine (SSVM). The system has been implemented through a hybrid platform that comprises Simulink modelling and STM32L4 mu C programming. The here proposed BCI has been in-vivo tested on 6 subjects (aged 26 2). The results showed that the LBP-based BCI reaches an accuracy - on the two choices - of 84.98 +/- 1.27 % while the computing chain asks, on average, for just similar to 271 ms after the stimulus to provide the classification.

Consequently a significant research effort has been made in the development of automatic EEG data analysis tools including but not limited to seizure detection as seizure frequency and/or intensity are one of the most important indicators of brain development. In this paper we propose to evaluate time dependent power spectral density using short time Fourier transform and using Frechet distance measure to detect presence and/or absence of seizures. We propose to use three different distance measures as they capture different properties of the corresponding PSD matrices. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms using real data set obtained in the NICU of the McMaster University Hospital. In order to benchmark performance of our proposed techniques we trained and tested a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

It is difficult due to noise from the internal and external artifacts and physiological interferences. The enhancement of the EEG-based emotion recognition processes can be achieved by selecting features that should be taken into account in further analysis. Therefore, the automatic feature selection of EEG signals is an important research area. We propose a multistep hybrid approach incorporating the Reversed Correlation Algorithm for automated frequency band-electrode combinations selection. Our method is simple to use and significantly reduces the number of sensors to only three channels. The proposed method has been verified by experiments performed on the DEAP dataset. The obtained effects have been evaluated regarding the accuracy of two emotions-valence and arousal. In comparison to other research studies, our method achieved classification results that were 4.20-8.44% greater. Moreover, it can be perceived as a universal EEG signal classification technique, as it belongs to unsupervised methods.

It serves as an alternative communication channel between the user and computer. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings prove to be an appropriate choice for imaging MI tasks in a BCI system as it provides a non-invasive way for completing the task. The reliability of a BCI system confides on the efficiency of the assessment of different MI tasks. Methods: The present work proposes a new approach for the classification of distinct MI tasks based on EEG signals using the flexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT) technique. The FAWT decomposes the EEG signal into sub-bands and temporal moment-based features are extracted from the sub-bands. Feature normalization is applied to minimize the bias nature of classifier. The FAWT-based features are utilized as inputs to multiple classifiers. Ensemble learning method based Subspace k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifier is established as the best and robust classifier for the distinction of the right hand (RH) and right foot (RF) MI tasks. Results: The sub-band (SB) wise features are tested on multiple classifiers and best performance parameters are obtained using the ensemble method based subspace kNN classifier. The best results of parameters are obtained for fourth SB as accuracy 99.33%, sensitivity 99%, specificity 99.6%, Fl-Score 0.9925, and kappa value 0.9865. The other sub-bands are also attained significant results using subspace KNN classifier. Conclusions: The proposed work explores the utility of FAWT based features for the classification of RH and RF MI tasks EEG signals. The suggested work highlights the effectiveness of multiple classifiers for classification MI-tasks. The proposed method shows better performance in comparison to state-of-arts methods.

However, most of the state-of-the-art methods identified emotions after analyzing facial images. Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has got less attention. However, the advantage of using EEG signals is that it can capture real emotion. However, very few EEG signals databases are publicly available for affective computing. In this work, we present a database consisting of EEG signals of 44 volunteers. Twenty-three out of forty-four are females. A 32 channels CLARITY EEG traveler sensor is used to record four emotional states namely, happy, fear, sad, and neutral of subjects by showing 12 videos. So, 3 video files are devoted to each emotion. Participants are mapped with the emotion that they had felt after watching each video. The recorded EEG signals are considered further to classify four types of emotions based on discrete wavelet transform and extreme learning machine (ELM) for reporting the initial benchmark classification performance. The ELM algorithm is used for channel selection followed by subband selection. The proposed method performs the best when features are captured from the gamma subband of the FP1-F7 channel with 94.72% accuracy. The presented database would be available to the researchers for affective recognition applications.

EEG signal contains transient components, spikes, and different types of artifacts due to eye blinking, movement of the person, anxiety, and so forth, during EEG capture. Wavelet transforms are powerful mathematical tool for sampling approximation to get clean EEG. It also helps in filtering, sampling, interpolation, noise reduction, signal approximation and signal enhancement, and feature extraction. In this paper, we have analyzed artifact cleaning via PSD graphs and statistical features extracted from motor imagery EEG-like standard deviation variance. For this, we considered 19 channels EEG signal and applied orthogonal Daubechies wavelet, bi-orthogonal rbio wavelet and Coifman wavelets to check the better performance of different wavelets. Coifman wavelet uses both scaling function and vanishing moments for sampling approximation and hence give smooth sampling compared to rbio and Daubechies wavelet transforms. Coif is a compactly supported wavelet system which also helps in smooth sampling approximations than other wavelets in the state of arts. The detailed coefficients and approximate coefficients can be further used for extracting features from EEG and classification purposes. Artifacts cleaning is thus observed better in coif wavelet analysis compared to other wavelets from the power distributions as power spectral density (PSD) graphs, standard deviation and variance obtained. Matlab R2013b is used for filtering and sampling EEG. Python 2.7 is used for statistical features extraction.

This paper introduces a new multimodal dataset called MERTI-Apps based on Asian physiological signals and proposes a genetic algorithm (GA)-long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model to derive the active feature groups for emotion recognition. This study developed an annotation labeling program for observers to tag the emotions of subjects by their arousal and valence during dataset creation. In the learning phase, a GA was used to select effective LSTM model parameters and determine the active feature group from 37 features and 25 brain lateralization features extracted from the electroencephalogram (EEG) time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. The proposed model achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.0156 in terms of the valence regression performance in the MAHNOB-HCI dataset, and RMSE performances of 0.0579 and 0.0287 in terms of valence and arousal regression performance, and 65.7% and 88.3% in terms of valence and arousal accuracy in the in-house MERTI-Apps dataset, which uses Asian-population-specific 12-channel EEG data and adds an additional brain lateralization (BL) feature. The results revealed 91.3% and 94.8% accuracy in the valence and arousal domain in the DEAP dataset owing to the effective model selection of a GA.

Criteria yielding high specificity are needed because EEG over-reading is a common cause of epilepsy misdiagnosis.MethodsSeven raters reviewed EEG sharp transients from 100 patients with and without epilepsy (diagnosed definitively by video-EEG recording of habitual events). Raters reviewed the transients, randomized, and classified them as epileptiform or nonepileptiform in 3 separate rounds: in 2, EEG was reviewed in sensor space (scoring the presence/absence of each IFCN criterion for each transient or classifying unrestricted by criteria [expert scoring]); in the other, review and classification were performed in source space.ResultsCutoff values of 4 and 5 criteria in sensor space and analysis in source space provided high accuracy (91%, 88%, and 90%, respectively), similar to expert scoring (92%). Two methods had specificity exceeding the desired threshold of 95%: using 5 IFCN criteria as cutoff and analysis in source space (both 95.65%); the sensitivity of these methods was 81.48% and 85.19%, respectively.ConclusionsThe presence of 5 IFCN criteria in sensor space and analysis in source space are optimal for clinical implementation. By extracting these objective features, diagnostic accuracy similar to expert scorings is achieved.Classification of evidenceThis study provides Class III evidence that IFCN criteria in sensor space and analysis in source space have high specificity (>95%) and sensitivity (81%-85%) for identification of IEDs.

J	Anuragi, A; Sisodia, DS				Anuragi, Arti; Sisodia, Dilip Singh			Empirical wavelet transform based automated alcoholism detecting using EEG signal features	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Signal processing; Electroencephalograms (EEGs); Alcoholism; Empirical wavelet transform (EWT); Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT)	TIME; CLASSIFICATION; DECOMPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are well used to characterize the brain states and actions. In this paper, a novel empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based machine learning framework is proposed for the classification of alcoholic and normal subjects using EEG signals. In the framework, the adaptive filtering is used to extract Time-Frequency-domain features from Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). The boundary detection method is used for segmenting the Fourier spectrum of the EEG signals to represent in scale-space. Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) examines time and frequency information in a single domain using instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous frequency (IF). The IA and IF are used to form intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The empirical wavelets transform (EWT) using Hilbert-Huang transforms (HHT) extract the statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis, Shannon entropy, and log entropy from each of the intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The extracted features are evaluated by t-test for finding the most significant features. The significant feature matrix is fed to various classification algorithms listed as least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM), support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN). The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) is used for training and testing of used models to minimize the chance of overfitting. The results suggest that the highest numbers of the positive samples are obtained using LS-SVM classifier with the polynomial kernel. The LS-SVM also achieved an average accuracy of 98.75%, the sensitivity 98.35%, specificity 99.16%, the precision 99.17%, F-measure 98.76%, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) 97.50%.

To develop and implement a novel approach which combines the technique of scout EEG source imaging (ESI) with convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks. Approach. The technique of ESI uses a boundary element method (BEM) and weighted minimum norm estimation (WMNE) to solve the EEG forward and inverse problems, respectively. Ten scouts are then created within the motor cortex to select the region of interest (ROI). We extract features from the time series of scouts using a Morlet wavelet approach. Lastly, CNN is employed for classifying MI tasks. Main results. The overall mean accuracy on the Physionet database reaches 94.5% and the individual accuracy of each task reaches 95.3%, 93.3%, 93.6%, 96% for the left fist, right fist, both fists and both feet, correspondingly, validated using ten-fold cross validation. We report an increase of up to 14.4% for overall classification compared with the competitive results from the state-of-the-art MI classification methods. Then, we add four new subjects to verify the validity of the method and the overall mean accuracy is 92.5%. Furthermore, the global classifier was adapted to single subjects improving the overall mean accuracy to 94.54%. Significance. The combination of scout ESI and CNN enhances BCI performance of decoding EEG four-class MI tasks.

Primarily, it starts having an impact on vulnerable populations, e.g., college students and physicians. While previous works have reported an alarmingly high rate of stress in students, little is known about whether there are stress-related brain activity changes. This study aims to examine the effects of a realistic stressor (examination) on students' stress levels and brain activities. We selected a cohort of 16 college students to participate in this study. Each subject was invited to the laboratory twice (pre-exam and in-exam) for completing a package of questionnaires. At the same time, we measure their brain physiological activity by using a portable EEG recorder. Our data reveal that examination- induced stress is associated with changes in the activity of the occipital and parietal-temporal areas in the brain. We construct a machine learning framework to estimate each student's stress level using features extracted from brain activities and a classification method. Finally, our study underlines the necessity of applying stress intervention to create an optimal learning environment for students.

Machine learning approaches are intensely being applied to this problem due to their ability to classify seizure conditions from a large amount of data, and provide pre-screened results for neurologists. Several features, data transformations, and classifiers have been explored to analyze and classify seizures via EEG signals. In the literature, some jointly-applied features used in the classification may have shared similar contributions, making them redundant in the learning process. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively summarize feature descriptions and their interpretations in characterizing epileptic seizures using EEG signals, as well as to review classification performance metrics. To provide meaningful information of feature selection, we conducted an experiment to examine the quality of each feature independently. The Bayesian error and non-parametric probability distribution estimation were employed to determine the significance of the individual features. Moreover, a redundancy analysis using a correlation-based feature selection was applied. The results showed that the following features - variance, energy, nonlinear energy, and Shannon entropy computed on a raw EEG signal, as well as variance, energy, kurtosis, and line length calculated on wavelet coefficients - were able to significantly capture the seizures. When compared with a baseline method of classifying all epochs as normal, an improvement of 4.77-13.51% in the Bayesian error was obtained. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ito, S; Ito, M; Fukumi, M				Ito, Shin-ichi; Ito, Momoyo; Fukumi, Minoru			Human-Wants Detection Based on Electroencephalogram Analysis During Exposure to Music	JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS AND MECHATRONICS			English	Article						wants detection; electroencephalogram; listening to music; convolutional neural networks; support vector machine	EMOTION RECOGNITION; EEG SIGNALS; ICA	We propose a method to detect human wants by using an electroencephalogram (EEG) test and specifying brain activity sensing positions. EEG signals can be analyzed by using various techniques. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been employed to analyze EEG signals, and these analyses have produced excellent results. Therefore, this paper employs CNN to extract EEG features. Also, support vector machines (SVMs) have shown good results for EEG pattern classification. This paper employs SVMs to classify the human cognition into "wants," "not wants," and "other feelings." In EEG measurements, the electrical activity of the brain is recorded using electrodes placed on the scalp. The sensing positions are related to the frontal cortex and/or temporal cortex activities although the mechanism to create wants is not clear. To specify the sensing positions and detect human wants, we conducted experiments using real EEG data. We confirmed that the mean and standard deviation values of the detection accuracy rate were 99.4% and 0.58%, respectively, when the target sensing positions were related to the frontal and temporal cortex activities. These results prove that both the frontal and temporal cortex activities are relevant for creating wants in the human brain, and that CNN and SVM are effective for the detection of human wants.

They consist of conscious mental reactions towards objects or situations and are associated with various physiological, behavioral, and cognitive changes. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis between different machine learning and deep learning techniques, with and without feature selection, for binarily classifying the six basic emotions, namely anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise, into two symmetrical categorical classes (emotion and no emotion), using the physiological recordings and subjective ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance from the DEAP (Dataset for Emotion Analysis using EEG, Physiological and Video Signals) database. The results showed that the maximum classification accuracies for each emotion were: anger: 98.02%, joy:100%, surprise: 96%, disgust: 95%, fear: 90.75%, and sadness: 90.08%. In the case of four emotions (anger, disgust, fear, and sadness), the classification accuracies were higher without feature selection. Our approach to emotion classification has future applicability in the field of affective computing, which includes all the methods used for the automatic assessment of emotions and their applications in healthcare, education, marketing, website personalization, recommender systems, video games, and social media.

Spatial covariance improves BCI performance for late ERPs components with high temporal variability	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; electroencephalography; event related potentials; covariance; riemannian geometry	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; EEG	Objective.Event Related Potentials (ERPs) reflecting cognitive response to external stimuli, are widely used in brain computer interfaces. ERP waveforms are characterized by a series of components of particular latency and amplitude. The classical ERP decoding methods exploit this waveform characteristic and thus achieve a high performance only if there is sufficient time- and phase-locking across trials. The required condition is not fulfilled if the experimental tasks are challenging or if it is needed to generalize across various experimental conditions. Features based on spatial covariances across channels can potentially overcome the latency jitter and delays since they aggregate the information across time.Approach.We compared the performance stability of waveform and covariance-based features as well as their combination in two simulated scenarios: 1) generalization across experiments on Error-related Potentials and 2) dealing with larger latency jitter across trials.Main results.The features based on spatial covariances provide a stable performance with a minor decline under jitter levels of up to +/- 300 ms, whereas the decoding performance with waveform features quickly drops from 0.85 to 0.55 AUC. The generalization across ErrP experiments also resulted in a significantly more stable performance with covariance-based features.Significance.The results confirmed our hypothesis that covariance-based features can be used to: 1) classify more reliably ERPs with higher intrinsic variability in more challenging real-life applications and 2) generalize across related experimental protocols.

J	Choi, JW; Huh, S; Jo, S				Choi, Jin Woo; Huh, Sejoon; Jo, Sungho			Improving performance in motor imagery BCI-based control applications via virtually embodied feedback	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Motor imagery; Embodiment; Virtual reality; Event-related desynchronization	DESYNCHRONIZATION; INTERFACE; SYNCHRONIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; SENSE; AREA	Objective: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) are commonly used for control applications. However, these applications require strong and discriminant neural patterns for which extensive experience in MI may be necessary. Inspired by the field of rehabilitation where embodiment is a key element for improving cortical activity, our study proposes a novel control scheme in which virtually embodiable feedback is provided during control to enhance performance. Methods: Subjects underwent two immersive virtual reality control scenarios in which they controlled the twodimensional movement of a device using electroencephalography (EEG). The two scenarios only differ on whether embodiable feedback, which mirrors the movement of the classified intention, is provided. After undergoing each scenario, subjects also answered a questionnaire in which they rated how immersive the scenario and embodiable the feedback were. Results: Subjects exhibited higher control performance, greater discriminability in brain activity patterns, and enhanced cortical activation when using our control scheme compared to the standard control scheme in which embodiable feedback is absent. Moreover, the self-rated embodiment and presence scores showed significantly positive linear relationships with performance. Significance: The findings in our study provide evidence that providing embodiable feedback as guidance on how intention is classified may be effective for control applications by inducing enhanced neural activity and patterns with greater discriminability. By applying embodiable feedback to immersive virtual reality, our study also serves as another instance in which virtual reality is shown to be a promising tool for improving MI.

The detection of epileptogenic region in brain is important for the detection of epilepsy disease. The signals from epileptogenic region in brain are focal signal and the signal from normal regions in brain is non-focal signal. Hence, the detection of focal signal is important for epilepsy disease detection. This paper proposes an automatic detection and diagnosis of EEG signals for epilepsy disease using soft computing approaches as adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and neural networks (NN). In this paper, the features from decomposed coefficients as bias (B), weight feature (W), entropy(E), activity feature (AF), mobility feature (MF), complexity feature (CF), skewness (S) and kurtosis (K) are extracted for the classification of EEG signals into either focal or non-focal signals for epilepsy disease detection and diagnosis. The detection of focal signal is achieved by ANFIS classifier and the diagnosis of the severity levels in focal signal is achieved by NN classification approach. The proposed method is used in many clinical diagnosis.

The system automatically estimates fear level based on multimodal sensory data and a self-reported emotion assessment. There are two modalities of expressing fear ratings: the 2-choice scale, where 0 represents relaxation and 1 stands for fear; and the 4-choice scale, with the following correspondence: 0-relaxation, 1-low fear, 2-medium fear and 3-high fear. A set of features was extracted from the sensory signals using various metrics that quantify brain (electroencephalogram-EEG) and physiological linear and non-linear dynamics (Heart Rate-HR and Galvanic Skin Response-GSR). The novelty consists in the automatic adaptation of exposure scenario according to the subject's affective state. We acquired data from acrophobic subjects who had undergone an in vivo pre-therapy exposure session, followed by a Virtual Reality therapy and an in vivo evaluation procedure. Various machine and deep learning classifiers were implemented and tested, with and without feature selection, in both a user-dependent and user-independent fashion. The results showed a very high cross-validation accuracy on the training set and good test accuracies, ranging from 42.5% to 89.5%. The most important features of fear level classification were GSR, HR and the values of the EEG in the beta frequency range. For determining the next exposure scenario, a dominant role was played by the target fear level, a parameter computed by taking into account the patient's estimated fear level.

Adaptive feature extraction in EEG-based motor imagery BCI: tracking mental fatigue	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						motor imagery; EEG; BCI; common spatial pattern; adaptation; mental fatigue	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SPATIAL FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION	Objective. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are non-stationary. This could be due to internal fluctuation of brain states such as fatigue, frustration, etc. This necessitates the development of adaptive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) whose performance does not deteriorate significantly with the adversary change in the cognitive state. In this paper, we put forward an unsupervised adaptive scheme to adapt the feature extractor of motor imagery (MI) BCIs by tracking the fatigue level of the user. Approach. Eleven subjects participated in the study during which they accomplished MI tasks while self-reporting their perceived levels of mental fatigue. Out of the 11 subjects, only six completed the whole experiment, while the others quit in the middle because of experiencing high fatigue. The adaptive feature extractor is attained through the adaptation of the common spatial patterns (CSP), one of the most popular feature extraction algorithms in EEG-based BCIs. The proposed method was analyzed in two ways: offline and in near real-time. The separability of the MI EEG features extracted by the proposed adaptive CSP (ADCSP) has been compared with that by the conventional CSP (C-CSP) and another CSP based adaptive method (ACSP) in terms of: Davies Bouldin index (DBI), Fisher score (FS) and Dunn's index (DI). Main results. Experimental results show significant improvement in the separability of MI EEG features extracted by ADCSP as compared to that by C-CSP and ACSP. Significance. Collectively, the results of the experiments in this study suggest that adapting CSP based on mental fatigue can improve the class separability of MI EEG features.

Given that identifying such patients is not a straightforward process and requires long courses of trial and error with anti-epilepsy drugs, this study aims at predicting those at-risk patients using clinical and demographic data obtained from electronic medical records. Specifically, the study employs several predictive analytics machine-learning methods, equipped with a novel approach for data balancing, to identify drug-resistant patients using their comorbidities and demographic information along with the initial epilepsy-related diagnosis made by their physician. The promising results we obtained highlight the potential use of machine-learning techniques in facilitating medical decisions and suggest the possibility of extending the proposed approach for developing a clinical decision support system for medical professionals.

Compared to seizure detection that only identifies the inter-ictal state and the ictal state, far fewer researches have been conducted on seizure prediction because the high similarity makes it challenging to distinguish between the pre-ictal state and the inter-ictal state. In this paper, a novel solution on seizure prediction is proposed using common spatial pattern (CSP) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, artificial pre-ictal EEG signals based on the original ones are generated by combining the segmented pre-ictal signals to solve the trial imbalance problem between the two states. Secondly, a feature extractor employing wavelet packet decomposition and CSP is designed to extract the distinguishing features in both the time domain and the frequency domain. It can improve overall accuracy while reducing the training time. Finally, a shallow CNN is applied to discriminate between the pre-ictal state and the inter-ictal state. Our proposed solution is evaluated on 23 patients' data from Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG dataset by employing a leave-one-out cross-validation, and it achieves a sensitivity of 92.2% and false prediction rate of 0.12/h. Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.

Auto seizure detection methods are developed by many researchers. Year by year new methods and new approaches are introduced by researchers to improve the performance of these automatic detection methods. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most widely used tool for detecting seizure as it has high resolution which makes it more feasible for analysis. In this paper we are introducing an approach based on stacked bidirectional long short term memory with global average pooling (LSTM_GAP) neural network for detecting epileptic seizure events. We use open access EEG dataset available in Bonn University Germany for the experiment. The model is evaluated based on three performance metrics, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy. It resulted with outstanding performance with 100% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in detecting epileptic seizure events which is the highest accuracy among all the techniques available in state-of-the art literature. Another advantage of LSTM_GAP model lies in its robustness in noise. In real, the EEG recorded in hospital laboratories consists of artefacts generated from eye blink and muscle activities of the patients. When our model will be put to practical use by the neurologists, the EEG recordings consisting of artefacts will be given as input to the model for detecting seizure events. Hence we need to develop a model which is robust against noise and which can provide good results even when the EEG data consisting artefacts is given as input. Hence we extended our experiment to check the performance of the LSTM_GAP model by adding eye blink artefacts and muscle artefacts to the input EEG data. The model was able to give superior results even after adding artefacts. We were able to achieve 97.67% sensitivity, 98.83% specificity and 97.65% accuracy. Thus LSTM_GAP model gives superior results for the EEG with and without noise compared to other methods in the literature.

It has analyzed a word, which presented a model based on CNN and LSTM methods, and how these methods can be used to both optimize and set up the hyper parameters of deep learning architecture. Later, it is studied how semi-supervised learning on EEG data analytics can be applied. We review some studies about different methods of semi-supervised learning on EEG data analytics and discussing the importance of semi-supervised learning for analyzing EEG data. In this paper, we also discuss the most common applications for human EEG research and review some papers about the application of EEG data analytics such as Neuromarketing, human factors, social interaction, and BCI.

Methods A six-level decomposition was applied using the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT). The wavelet variance and 95% CIs were calculated for each level of the decomposition. The number of changes in variance for each level were found using a change-point detection method of Whitcher. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine if there were differences in the median number of change points within channels and across frequency bands (levels). Results No distinctive pattern was found for the wavelet variances to differentiate the seizure and non-seizure channels. The seizure channels tended to have lower variances for each level and overall, but this pattern only held for one of the three seizure channels (RAST4). The median number of change points did not differ between the seizure and non-seizure channels either within each channel or across the frequency bands. Conclusion The use of the MODWT in examining the variances and changes in variance did not show specific patterns which differentiate between seizure and non-seizure channels.

The clinical significance of small sharp spikes: A retrospective study of 909 patients in epilepsy monitoring unit	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; Small sharp spikes; Interictal epileptiform discharges; Ictal epileptic discharges	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE; ILAE COMMISSION; POSITION PAPER; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURES; SLEEP; FEAR	Objectives: To determine the incidence and clinical significance of small sharp spikes (SSS) in the patient population of the adult Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU). Methods: This is a retrospective study of EEG data and medical records from consecutive patients who underwent video-EEG recording in the adult EMU from March 2013 to February 2019. SSS, interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), and ictal patterns were identified. Results: Of the 909 patients reviewed, SSS were observed in110 (12.1 %) patients. Epilepsy was present in 101 of the 110 (91.8 %) patients with SSS and in 441 of the 799 (55.2 %) patients without SSS. The incidence of epilepsy was significantly higher in patients with SSS than in those without SSS (OR = 9.1, 95 % CI: 4.5-18.3, P < 0.01). The sensitivity of SSS for epilepsy was 18.6 % and the specificity was 97.5 %. The incidence of SSS was strongly correlated with the frequency of IEDs (OR 1.89; 95 %CI: 1.60-2.24, P < 0.01). When both present, SSS and IEDs were co-lateralized in the same hemisphere. Conclusions: There is a statistically significant association between SSS and focal epilepsy. SSS have similar clinical implications to IEDs in the lateralization and localization of temporal lobe seizures. SSS can be an epileptiform EEG pattern for temporal lobe epilepsy.

Many cognitive processes are involved in navigation tasks, even in the simplest scenario, such as landmarks encoding, cognitive map anchoring, goal-oriented planning, and motor executing. Engaging multiple tasks simultaneously could lead to higher cognitive load and attenuated navigation performance. In this study, we investigate the cognitive load of participants while they perform a navigation task. We demonstrated the ability to extract neural features from complex physical movement tasks, such as navigation. We found that retrosplenial complex (RSC) shows a distinct features for mental workload related task. We further evaluated participant's cognitive load with different machine learning algorithm and found that CNN is able to classify with 93% accuracy. The results provided a potential approach to study cognitive load in a more naturalistic scenario.	[Do, Tien-Thong Nguyen; Singh, Avinash Kumar; Cortes, Carlos A.

Neural correlates of perceptual color inferences as revealed by #thedress	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						color perception; color constancy; EEG; frequency tagging; individual differences	VENTRAL VISUAL PATHWAY; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; FACE PERCEPTION; STEADY-STATE; RESPONSES; CORTEX; MECHANISMS; SIGNALS; DISCRIMINATION; CATEGORIZATION	Color constancy involves disambiguating the spectral characteristics of lights and surfaces, for example to distinguish red in white light from white in red light. Solving this problem appears especially challenging for bluish tints, which may be attributed more often to shading, and this bias may underlie the individual differences in whether people described the widely publicized image of #thedress as blue-black or white-gold. To probe these higher-level color inferences, we examined neural correlates of the blue-bias, using frequency-tagging and high-density electroencephalography to monitor responses to 3-Hz alternations between different color versions of #thedress. Specifically, we compared relative neural responses to the original "blue" dress image alternated with the complementary "yellow" image (formed by inverting the chromatic contrast of each pixel). This image pair produced a large modulation of the electroencephalography amplitude at the alternation frequency, consistent with a perceived contrast difference between the blue and yellow images. Furthermore, decoding topographical differences in the blue-yellow asymmetries over occipitoparietal channels predicted blue-black and white-gold observers with over 80% accuracy. The blue-yellow asymmetry was stronger than for a "red" versus "green" pair matched for the same component differences in L versus M or S versus LM chromatic contrast as the blue-yellow pair and thus cannot be accounted for by asymmetries within either precortical cardinal mechanism. Instead, the results may point to neural correlates of a higher-level perceptual representation of surface colors.	[Retter, Talia L.; Gwinn, O.

Evaluation of time domain features on detection of epileptic seizure from EEG signals	HEALTH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epileptic seizure; Waveform length (WL); Number of zero-crossing (ZC); Slope sign change (SSC); Naive Bayes (NB); Support vector machine (SVM)	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; PREDICTABILITY; TRANSFORM; SCHEME; ONSET	In the study of detection of an epileptic seizure using Electroencephalogram (EEG), pattern recognition has been recognised as a valued tool. In this pattern recognition study, the first time the authors have attempted to use time domain (TD) features such as waveform length (WL), number of zero-crossings (ZC) and number of slope sign changes (SSC) derived directly from filtered EEG data and from discrete wavelet transform (DWT) of filtered EEG data for the detection of an epileptic seizure. Further, the authors attempted to study the performance of other time domain features such as mean absolute value (MAV), standard deviation (SD), average power (AVP) which had been attempted by other researchers. The performance of the TD features is studied using naive Bayes (NB) and support vector machines (SVM) classifiers for University of Bonn database with fourteen different combinations of set E with set A to D and clinically inferred with Christian Medical College, Vellore database. The proposed scheme was also compared with other existing scheme in the literature. The implementation results showed that the proposed scheme could attain the highest accuracy of 100% for normal eyes open and epileptic data set with direct as well as DWT based TD features. For other data sets, the highest accuracy are obtained with DWT based TD features using SVM.

Current systems often use driving behavior parameters for driver drowsiness detection. The continuous driving automation reduces the availability of these parameters, therefore reducing the scope of such methods. Especially, techniques that include physiological measurements seem to be a promising alternative. However, in a dynamic environment such as driving, only non- or minimal intrusive methods are accepted, and vibrations from the roadbed could lead to degraded sensor technology. This work contributes to driver drowsiness detection with a machine learning approach applied solely to physiological data collected from a non-intrusive retrofittable system in the form of a wrist-worn wearable sensor. To check accuracy and feasibility, results are compared with reference data from a medical-grade ECG device. A user study with 30 participants in a high-fidelity driving simulator was conducted. Several machine learning algorithms for binary classification were applied in user-dependent and independent tests. Results provide evidence that the non-intrusive setting achieves a similar accuracy as compared to the medical-grade device, and high accuracies (>92%) could be achieved, especially in a user-dependent scenario. The proposed approach offers new possibilities for human-machine interaction in a car and especially for driver state monitoring in the field of automated driving.

Common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is most frequently applied for feature engineering in motor imagery (MI) based BCI system. How to select the most suitable spatial channels, temporal & frequency parameters for different people before CSP is still a challenging issue which greatly affects the performance of MI based BCI system. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive multi-domain feature joint optimization framework. Specifically, random forest (RF) and composite kernel support vector machine (CKSVM) algorithms are used to measure the significances of different spatial channels and local temporal-frequency segments. An ant colony optimization (ACO) based scheme is proposed to search the most suitable spatial channels and temporal-frequency segments. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on public BCI competition III data set IVa and two self-collected MI EEG datasets. For BCI competition III data set IVa, our method outperforms some other close related algorithms in the literature. For the two self-collected datasets, compared to the traditional manual parameter setting, the classification performance is proven to significantly improve (more than 15%) adopting our adaptive multi-domain parameters. Since our proposed method can simultaneously and automatically optimize subject-specific features in the entire spatial-temporal-frequency domains, the most discriminative CSP features can be selected and the performance of MI EEG classification is significantly improved. Thus, our research is a useful complement to the BCI field. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objective: To demonstrate the utility of EEG as a reliable, quantitative biomarker with potential as a pharmacodynamic endpoint for use in clinical assessments of neuroprotective therapeutics for Parkison's disease. Methods: A multi modal study was performed including aquisition of resting state EEG data and dopamine transporter PET imaging from Parkinson's disease patients off medication and compared against age-matched controls. Results: Qualitative and test/retest analysis of the EEG data demonstrated the reliability of the methods. Source localization using lowresolution brain electromagnetic tomography identified significant differences in Parkinson's patients versus control subjects in the anterior cingulate and temporal lobe, areas with established association to Parkinson's disease pathology. Changes in cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic coupling were observed as excessive EEG beta coherence in Parkinson's disease patients, and correlated with UPDRS scores and dopamine transporter activity, supporting the potential for cortical EEG coherence to serve as a reliable measure of disease severity. Using machine learning approaches, an EEG discriminant function analysis classifier was identified that parallels the loss of dopamine synapses as measured by dopamine transporter PET. Conclusion: Our results support the utility of EEG in characterizing alterations in neurophysiological oscillatory activity associated with Parkinson's disease and highlight potential as a reliable method for monitoring disease progression and as a pharmacodynamic endpoint for Parkinson's disease modification therapy.

J	Xu, T; Zhou, Y; Hou, ZK; Zhang, WL				Xu, Tao; Zhou, Yun; Hou, Zekai; Zhang, Wenlan			Decode Brain System: A Dynamic Adaptive Convolutional Quorum Voting Approach for Variable-Length EEG Data	COMPLEXITY			English	Article								The brain is a complex and dynamic system, consisting of interacting sets and the temporal evolution of these sets. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain activity play a vital role to decode the cognitive process of human beings in learning research and application areas. In the real world, people react to stimuli differently, and the duration of brain activities varies between individuals. Therefore, the length of EEG recordings in trials gathered in the experiment is variable. However, current approaches either fix the length of EEG recordings in each trial which would lose information hidden in the data or use the sliding window which would consume large computation on overlapped parts of slices. In this paper, we propose TOO (Traverse Only Once), a new approach for processing variable-length EEG trial data. TOO is a convolutional quorum voting approach that breaks the fixed structure of the model through convolutional implementation of sliding windows and the replacement of the fully connected layer by the 1 x 1 convolutional layer. Each output cell generated from 1 x 1 convolutional layer corresponds to each slice created by a sliding time window, which reflects changes in cognitive states. Then, TOO employs quorum voting on output cells and determines the cognitive state representing the entire single trial. Our approach provides an adaptive model for trials of different lengths with traversing EEG data of each trial only once to recognize cognitive states. We design and implement a cognitive experiment and obtain EEG data. Using the data collecting from this experiment, we conducted an evaluation to compare TOO with a state-of-art sliding window end-to-end approach. The results show that TOO yields a good accuracy (83.58%) at the trial level with a much lower computation (11.16%). It also has the potential to be used in variable signal processing in other application areas.

Sleep spindles can be detected in EEG, however, identifying sleep spindles in EEG recordings manually is very time-consuming and typically requires highly trained experts. Research on the automatic detection of sleep spindles in infant EEGs has been limited to-date. In this study, we present a novel supervised machine learning-based algorithm to detect sleep spindles in infant EEG recordings. EEGs collected from 141 ex-term born infants and 6 ex-preterm born infants, recorded at 4 months of age (adjusted), were used to train and test the algorithm. Sleep spindles were annotated by experienced clinical physiologists as the gold standard. The dataset was split into training (81 ex-term), validation (30 exterm), and testing (30 ex-term + 6 ex-preterm) set. 15 features were selected for input into a random forest algorithm. Sleep spindles were detected in the ex-term infant EEG test set with 92.1% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity. For ex-preterm born infants, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.3% and 91.8% respectively. The proposed algorithm has the potential to assist researchers and clinicians in the automated analysis of sleep spindles in infant EEG.

Many methods and algorithms that can detect seizures in epileptic patients have been proposed. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of helpful tools for investigating epilepsy forms in patients, however, an expert in the neurological field must perform a visual inspection to identify a seizure. Such analyses require longer time because of the huge dataset recorded from many electrodes which are put on the human scalp. With the non-stationary nature of EEG, especially during the abnormality periods, entropy measures gain more interest in the field. In this work, by exploring the advantages of both reliable state-of-the-art entropies, fuzzy entropy and distribution entropy, a modified-Distribution entropy (mDistEn) for epilepsy detection is proposed. As the results, the proposed mDistEn method can successfully achieve the same consistency and better accuracy than using the state-of-the-art entropies. The mDistEn corresponds to higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) values compared with the fuzzy entropy and the distribution entropy and yields 92% classification accuracy.

Home automation is a fast emerging area that involves monitoring and controlling of household appliances for user comfort and efficient management. Using mental commands to control different electrical appliances and objects in house is a very interesting application. Brain-Computer Interface is used to relay the information from the subject's brain to an Electronic device, and such devices can be used for this purpose. The information from the subject's brain is collected in form of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this paper, we analyze the use of EEG signals for applications related to home automation. We present a hybrid model which makes use of Long Short-Term Memory which is considered as a robust temporal classification model in AI and classical Random Forest Classifier for EEG classification. We also discuss how our proposed hybrid model overcomes the limitation presented by the individual models. To arrive at the best model, we have analyzed various parameters such as sampling rate and combination of different brain rhythms which we finally use in our hybrid model. Based on experiments conducted on a custom-built dataset, we also discuss the spatial significance of different electrodes of the EEG device and get insight in signals generated from different areas of the brain.

Considering this, current study aims to use correlation-driven mapping to improve artifact detection performance.Approach.A framework is proposed here for mapping signals from multichannel space (regardless of the number of EEG channels) into two-dimensional RGB space, in which the correlation of all EEG channels is simultaneously taken into account, and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model can then learn specific patterns in generated 2D representation related to specific artifact.Main results.The method with a classification accuracy of 92.30% (AUC = 0.96) in a leave-three-subjects-out cross-validation procedure was evaluated using data including 2310 EEG sequences contaminated by artifacts and 2285 artifact-free EEG sequences collected with BrainStatus self-adhesive electrode and wireless amplifier from 15 intensive care patients. For further assessment, several scenarios were also tested including performance variation of proposed method under different segment lengths, different numbers of isoline and different numbers of channel. The results showed outperformance of CNN fed by correlation coefficients data over both spectrogram-based CNN and EEGNet on the same dataset.Significance.This study showed the feasibility of utilizing correlation image of EEG channels coupled with deep learning as a promising tool for dimensionality reduction, channels fusion and capturing various artifacts patterns in temporal-spatial domains. A simplified version of proposed approach was also shown to be feasible in real-time application with latency of 0.0181 s for making real-time decision.

In particular, inspired by the Giulio Tononi's Integrated Information Theory and by the Max Tegmark's representation of consciousness, we study order-disorder phase transitions on Curie-Weiss models generated by processing EEG signals. The latter have been recorded on healthy individuals undergoing deep sedation. Then, we implement a machine learning tool for classifying mental states using, as input, the critical temperatures computed in the Curie-Weiss models. Results show that, by the proposed method, it is possible to discriminate between states of awareness and states of deep sedation. Besides, we identify a state space for representing the path between mental states, whose dimensions correspond to critical temperatures computed over different frequency bands of the EEG signal. Beyond possible theoretical implications in the study of human consciousness, resulting from our model, we deem relevant to emphasise that the proposed method could be exploited for clinical applications.

In such BCI systems, movement intention detection algorithms are used to detect movement desires. In recent years, movement-related cortical potential (MRCP), an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern representing voluntary movement intention, attracts wide attention in movement intention detection. Unfortunately, low MRCP detection accuracy makes the asynchronous BCI system impractical for real usage. In order to develop an effective MRCP detection algorithm, EEG data have to be properly preprocessed. In this work, we investigate the relationship and effects of three factors including frequency bands, spatial filters, and classifiers on MRCP classification performance to determine best settings. In particular, we performed a systematic performance investigation on combinations of five frequency bands, five spatial filters, and six classifiers. The EEG data were acquired from subjects performing series of self-paced ankle dorsiflexions. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test was performed on F1 scores to investigate effects of these three factors. The results show that frequency bands and spatial filters depend on each other. The combinations directly affect the F1 scores, so they have to be chosen carefully. The results can be used as guidelines for BCI researchers to effectively design a preprocessing method for an advanced asynchronous BCI system, which can assist the stroke rehabilitation.

Currently, both aspects of cognition can only be assessed using paper-based psychometric tests. The methods however, are exposed to inconsistency issues due to the variation of examination format and language barriers. Hence, this study proposes an intelligent system for assessing intelligence quotient (IQ) level and learning style from the resting brainwaves using artificial neural network (ANN). Eighty-five individuals from varying educational backgrounds have participated in this study. Resting electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded from the left prefrontal cortex using NeuroSky. Control groups are established using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (LSI) and a model developed based on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Subsequently, theta, alpha and beta power ratio is extracted from the pre-processed EEG. Distribution and pattern of features show a correlation with the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis of intelligence and Alpha Suppression Theory. The power ratio features are then used to train, validate and test the ANN model. The system has demonstrated satisfactory performance for IQ classification with accuracies of 98.3% for training and 94.7% for testing. The proposed model is also able to classify learning style with accuracies of 96.9% for training and 80.0% for testing.

Three quarters of these do not receive the treatment they need due to delays in interpreting electroencephalograms (EEGs). This paper presents a Machine learning model to support the diagnosis of pediatric epilepsy in semi-automatic way. The model was built from more than 100 pediatric EEGs, with a diagnosis of epileptic seizure. The results achieved using the software were compared with annotations made by a pediatric neurologist, reaching up to 85% agreement. In addition, the neurologists stated that, during the evaluation of a 30-min EEG, the system allowed them to save up to half of the time that usually takes. The tool herein presented facilitates the study and evaluation of pediatric EEGs using a semi-automatic classification of EEG signals and it can be used in the diagnosis of pediatric epilepsy.

It consists of applying empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to extract the most relevant intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and subsequent computation of the Teager and instantaneous energy, Higuchi and Petrosian fractal dimension, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) for each IMF. We validated the method using a public dataset of 24 subjects with EEG signals from 22 channels and showed that it is possible to classify the epileptic seizures, even with segments of six seconds and a smaller number of channels (e.g., an accuracy of 0.93 using five channels). We were able to create a general machine-learning-based model to detect epileptic seizures of new subjects using epileptic-seizure data from various subjects, after reducing the number of instances, based on the k-means algorithm.

Compared with most of the existing transfer classifiers, our classifier has its own characteristics: (1) the labeled EEG epochs from the source domain cannot accurately represent the primary EEG epochs in the target domain. Our classifier can make use of very few calibration data in the target domain to induce the target predictive function. (2) A joint distribution adaption is used to minimize the marginal distribution distance and the conditional distribution distance between the source domain and the target domain. (3) Clustering techniques are used to select source domains so that the computational complexity of our classifier is reduced. We construct six transfer scenarios based on the original EEG signals provided by the Bonn University to verify the performance of our classifier and introduce four baselines and a transfer support vector machine (SVM) for benchmarking studies. Experimental results indicate that our classifier wins the best performance and is not very sensitive to its parameters.

In this research, we explore the ability of a newly-developed algorithm named scattering transform in seizure detection. The preprocessed signal is initially decomposed into scattering coefficients with various orders and scales employing scattering transform. Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) and Log energy entropy (LogEn) of the sub-band coefficients are obtained to characterize the epileptic seizure signals. Then the joint features are fed into five classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM), genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) for the verification of the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Finally, we not only compare the classification results and the time efficiency derived from different classifiers, but also explore the discrimination performance of the proposed methodology based on ten different classification tasks with great clinical significance. The prominent classification accuracy (ACC) of 99.87 %, 99.59 %, 99.58 %, 99.56 % and 99.80 % are achieved using the above five classifiers respectively. The average ACC and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 99.75 % and 0.99 are also yielded based on all tasks. Furthermore, the result of Kruskal-Wallis Test for the verification of statistical significance confirms the reliability of the proposal. The comparison with the latest state-of-the-art techniques indicates the superior performance of the proposal. A tradeoff between classification accuracy and time complexity of the proposed approach is accomplished in our work and the possibility for clinical application is also demonstrated.

Early detection of such prevalent abnormality through EEG pattern analysis with the help of computer-aided diagnostic tools; provide significant relief to the health care professionals for better management and treatment of such patients. This work has been proposed as an investigation of the sensory responsiveness of the children affected by ASD. This ASD is analyzed by extracting the non-linear features of the EEG signal. A total of 73 EEG signals are collected from different patients out of which 41 are affected with ASD and 32 with normal neural activity. These signals are then pre-processed and filtered using a low pass filter and then separated using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) into additive subcomponents. Significant features are extracted, which can be further investigated to identify event-related potential and Non-biological Artifacts. These features are then classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an accuracy of 90.41%. As a result, appropriate sensory profiles can be obtained that may help proper diagnosis and treatment at an early stage.

Brandon			Sleep staging from electrocardiography and respiration with deep learning	SLEEP			English	Article						electrocardiography; respiration; sleep stages; deep learning	CLASSIFICATION; AGREEMENT; SIGNALS; EEG	Study Objectives: Sleep is reflected not only in the electroencephalogram but also in heart rhythms and breathing patterns. We hypothesized that it is possible to accurately stage sleep based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals. Methods: Using a dataset including 8682 polysomnograms, we develop deep neural networks to stage sleep from ECG and respiratory signals. Five deep neural networks consisting of convolutional networks and long- and short-term memory networks are trained to stage sleep using heart and breathing, including the timing of R peaks from ECG, abdominal and chest respiratory effort, and the combinations of these signals. Results: ECG in combination with the abdominal respiratory effort achieved the best performance for staging all five sleep stages with a Cohen's kappa of 0.585 (95% confidence interval +/- 0.017); and 0.760 (+/- 0.019) for discriminating awake vs. rapid eye movement vs. nonrapid eye movement sleep. Performance is better for younger ages, whereas it is robust for body mass index, apnea severity, and commonly used outpatient medications. Conclusions: Our results validate that ECG and respiratory effort provide substantial information about sleep stages in a large heterogeneous population. This opens new possibilities in sleep research and applications where electroencephalography is not readily available or may be infeasible.

J	Shalbaf, A; Bagherzadeh, S; Maghsoudi, A				Shalbaf, Ahmad; Bagherzadeh, Sara; Maghsoudi, Arash			Transfer learning with deep convolutional neural network for automated detection of schizophrenia from EEG signals	PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Electroencephalogram; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural network; Continuous wavelet transform	COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS; WHITE-MATTER VOLUMES; PREDICTION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM; CANCER; GRAY	Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe disorder of the human brain which disturbs behavioral characteristics such as interruption in thinking, memory, perception, speech and other living activities. If the patient suffering from SZ is not diagnosed and treated in the early stages, damage to human behavioral abilities in its later stages could become more severe. Therefore, early discovery of SZ may help to cure or limit the effects. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is prominently used to study brain diseases such as SZ due to having high temporal resolution information, and being a noninvasive and inexpensive method. This paper introduces an automatic methodology based on transfer learning with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the diagnosis of SZ patients from healthy controls. First, EEG signals are converted into images by applying a time-frequency approach called continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method. Then, the images of EEG signals are applied to the four popular pre-trained CNNs: AlexNet, ResNet-18, VGG-19 and Inception-v3. The output of convolutional and pooling layers of these models are used as deep features and are fed into the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We have tuned the parameters of SVM to classify SZ patients and healthy subjects. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated on EEG signals from 14 healthy subjects and 14 SZ patients. The experiments showed that the combination of frontal, central, parietal, and occipital regions applied to the ResNet-18-SVM achieved best results with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.60% +/- 2.29, 99.65% +/- 2.35 and 96.92% +/- 2.25, respectively. Therefore, the proposed method as a diagnostic tool can help clinicians in detection of the SZ patients for early diagnosis and treatment.

Voluntarily induced electroencephalogram (EEG) signal during gait and sit motor imagery (MI) was decoded and translate into the exoskeleton as control commands in real-time. While it is hard to tell when the user engages in the conventional BCI control system, the EEG signal via the user's consecutive eye-blink was used as an initiation of MI in the proposed semi-synchronous control system; hence the EEG decoder is able to denote the transition point. This semi-synchronous BCI control system combines the advantages of asynchronous and synchronous BCI systems by understanding the user's MI environment for robust exception handling. The classifier's flow diagram of the presented BCI control system was described as a finite state machine.

The emergence of mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) platforms have expanded the use cases of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) from laboratory-oriented experiments to our daily life. In challenging situations where humans' natural behaviors such as head movements are unrestrained, various artifacts could deteriorate the performance of BCI applications. This paper explored the effect of muscular artifacts generated by participants' head movements on the signal characteristics and classification performance of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Approach. A moving visual flicker was employed to induce not only SSVEPs but also horizontal and vertical head movements at controlled speeds, leading to acquiring EEG signals with intensity-manipulated muscular artifacts. To properly induce neck muscular activities, a laser light was attached to participants' heads to give visual feedback; the laser light indicates the direction of the head independently from eye movements. The visual stimulus was also modulated by four distinct frequencies (10, 11, 12, and 13 Hz). The amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were estimated to quantify the effects of head movements on the signal characteristics of the elicited SSVEPs. The frequency identification accuracy was also estimated by using well-established decoding algorithms including calibration-free and fully-calibrated approaches. Main results. The amplitude and SNR of SSVEPs tended to deteriorate when the participants moved their heads, and this tendency was significantly stronger in the vertical head movements than in the horizontal movements. The frequency identification accuracy also deteriorated in proportion to the speed of head movements. Importantly, the accuracy was significantly higher than its chance-level regardless of the level of artifact contamination and algorithms. Significance. The results suggested the feasibility of decoding SSVEPs in humans freely moving their head directions, facilitating the real-world applications of mobile BCIs.

J	Saa, JD; Christen, A; Martini, S; Pasley, BN; Knight, RT; Giraud, AL				Saa, Jaime Delgado; Christen, Andy; Martini, Stephanie; Pasley, Brian N.; Knight, Robert T.; Giraud, Anne-Lise			Using Coherence-based spectro-spatial filters for stimulus features prediction from electro-corticographic recordings	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; MOVEMENT DIRECTION; CHANNEL SELECTION; HAND MOVEMENT; EEG SIGNALS; SPEECH; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	The traditional approach in neuroscience relies on encoding models where brain responses are related to different stimuli in order to establish dependencies. In decoding tasks, on the contrary, brain responses are used to predict the stimuli, and traditionally, the signals are assumed stationary within trials, which is rarely the case for natural stimuli. We hypothesize that a decoding model assuming each experimental trial as a realization of a random process more likely reflects the statistical properties of the undergoing process compared to the assumption of stationarity. Here, we propose a Coherence-based spectro-spatial filter that allows for reconstructing stimulus features from brain signal's features. The proposed method extracts common patterns between features of the brain signals and the stimuli that produced them. These patterns, originating from different recording electrodes are combined, forming a spatial filter that produces a unified prediction of the presented stimulus. This approach takes into account frequency, phase, and spatial distribution of brain features, hence avoiding the need to predefine specific frequency bands of interest or phase relationships between stimulus and brain responses manually. Furthermore, the model does not require the tuning of hyper-parameters, reducing significantly the computational load attached to it. Using three different cognitive tasks (motor movements, speech perception, and speech production), we show that the proposed method consistently improves stimulus feature predictions in terms of correlation (group averages of 0.74 for motor movements, 0.84 for speech perception, and 0.74 for speech production) in comparison with other methods based on regularized multivariate regression, probabilistic graphical models and artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the model parameters revealed those anatomical regions and spectral components that were discriminant in the different cognitive tasks. This novel method does not only provide a useful tool to address fundamental neuroscience questions, but could also be applied to neuroprosthetics.

A Novel Method for Objective Selection of Information Sources Using Multi-Kernel SVM and Local Scaling	SENSORS			English	Article						machine learning; multimodality; multiple kernel learning; support vector machines; source selection	CHANNEL SELECTION; EEG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; RECOGNITION; SEQUENCE; FEATURES	Advancement on computer and sensing technologies has generated exponential growth in the data available for the development of systems that support decision-making in fields such as health, entertainment, manufacturing, among others. This fact has made that the fusion of data from multiple and heterogeneous sources became one of the most promising research fields in machine learning. However, in real-world applications, to reduce the number of sources while maintaining optimal system performance is an important task due to the availability of data and implementation costs related to processing, implementation, and development times. In this work, a novel method for the objective selection of relevant information sources in a multimodality system is proposed. This approach takes advantage of the ability of multiple kernel learning (MKL) and the support vector machines (SVM) classifier to perform an optimal fusion of data by assigning weights according to their discriminative value in the classification task; when a kernel is designed for representing each data source, these weights can be used as a measure of their relevance. Moreover, three algorithms for tuning the Gaussian kernel bandwidth in the classifier prediction stage are introduced to reduce the computational cost of searching for an optimal solution; these algorithms are an adaptation of a common technique in unsupervised learning named local scaling. Two real application tasks were used to evaluate the proposed method: the selection of electrodes for a classification task in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems and the selection of relevant Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences for detection of breast cancer. The obtained results show that the proposed method allows the selection of a small number of information sources.

While existing decoding methods work well in static, single-subject cases, more versatile, multi-subject decoding methods should be developed for achieving scalable and transferable BCI systems. In practice, it is not straightforward to record brain signals using the same recording equipment from a large number of subjects. If a pretrained decoder is not robust to subject or channel shifts, it cannot be applied to data from novel subjects and even from trained subjects when the recording equipment changes. In this work, we study brain decoding across multiple subjects with a different number of recording channels and channel location shifts. We consider channel-agnostic brain decoding as a multi-instance learning problem, where each input is seen as a set of instances. We propose a novel decoder architecture based on three building blocks: a channel-wise transform, an across-channel transform, and multi-channel pooling. We conduct a thorough experiment on our multi-subject electrocorticography (ECoG) classification dataset to verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods against other baseline architectures. Our results show that, even without any explicit spatial information about channels, our proposed architecture with channel permutation invariance and channel interactions work well in channel-agnostic multi-subject brain decoding.

On Assessing Driver Awareness of Situational Criticalities: Multi-modal Bio-Sensing and Vision-Based Analysis, Evaluations, and Insights	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						bio-sensing; brain-computer interfaces; EEG; PPG; GSR; deep learning; human-machine interaction	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; CLASSIFICATION; LEVEL	Automobiles for our roadways are increasingly using advanced driver assistance systems. The adoption of such new technologies requires us to develop novel perception systems not only for accurately understanding the situational context of these vehicles, but also to infer the driver's awareness in differentiating between safe and critical situations. This manuscript focuses on the specific problem of inferring driver awareness in the context of attention analysis and hazardous incident activity. Even after the development of wearable and compact multi-modal bio-sensing systems in recent years, their application in driver awareness context has been scarcely explored. The capability of simultaneously recording different kinds of bio-sensing data in addition to traditionally employed computer vision systems provides exciting opportunities to explore the limitations of these sensor modalities. In this work, we explore the applications of three different bio-sensing modalities namely electroencephalogram (EEG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) along with a camera-based vision system in driver awareness context. We assess the information from these sensors independently and together using both signal processing- and deep learning-based tools. We show that our methods outperform previously reported studies to classify driver attention and detecting hazardous/non-hazardous situations for short time scales of two seconds. We use EEG and vision data for high resolution temporal classification (two seconds) while additionally also employing PPG and GSR over longer time periods. We evaluate our methods by collecting user data on twelve subjects for two real-world driving datasets among which one is publicly available (KITTI dataset) while the other was collected by us (LISA dataset) with the vehicle being driven in an autonomous mode. This work presents an exhaustive evaluation of multiple sensor modalities on two different datasets for attention monitoring and hazardous events classification.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG) exams can provide more reliable data for analysis of this behavior. This paper proposes a new approach for the automatic diagnosis of patients with alcoholism and introduces an analysis of the EEG signals from a two-dimensional perspective according to changes in the neural activity, highlighting the influence of high and low-frequency signals. This approach uses a two-dimensional feature extraction method, as well as the application of recent Computer Vision (CV) techniques, such as Transfer Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The methodology to evaluate our proposal used 21 combinations of the traditional classification methods and 84 combinations of recent CNN architectures used as feature extractors combined with the following classical classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). CNN MobileNet combined with SVM achieved the best results in Accuracy (95.33%), Precision (95.68%), F1-Score (95.24%), and Recall (95.00%). This combination outperformed the traditional methods by up to 8%. Thus, this approach is applicable as a classification stage for computer-aided diagnoses, useful for the triage of patients, and clinical support for the early diagnosis of this disease.

The parameters are learnt layer-by-layer in each auto-encoder (AE). As optimization is one of the main components of the neural networks and auto-encoders, the learning rate is one of the crucial hyper-parameters of neural networks and AE. This issue on a large scale and especially sparse data sets is more important. In this paper, we adapt the learning rate for special AE corresponding to various components of AE networks in each stochastic gradient calculation and analyze the theoretical convergence of back-propagation learning for the proposed method. We also promote our methodology for online adaptive optimizations suitable for deep learning. We obtain promising results compared to constant learning rates on the (1) MNIST digit, (2) blogs-Gender-100 text, (3) smartphone based recognition of human activities and postural transitions time series, and (4) EEG brainwave feeling emotions time series classification tasks using a single machine.

Discrete wavelet transform is widely used in feature extraction step because it efficiently works in this field, as confirmed by the results of previous studies. The feature selection step is used to minimize dimensionality by excluding irrelevant features. This step is conducted using differential evolution. This article presents an efficient model for EEG classification by considering feature extraction and selection. Seven different types of common wavelets were tested in our research work. These are Discrete Meyer (dmey), Reverse biorthogonal (rbio), Biorthogonal (bior), Daubechies (db), Symlets (sym), Coiflets (coif), and Haar (Haar). Several kinds of discrete wavelet transform are used to produce a wide variety of features. Afterwards, we use differential evolution to choose appropriate features that will achieve the best performance of signal classification. For classification step, we have used Bonn databases to build the classifiers and test their performance. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed model.

J	Liu, TJ; Huang, G; Jiang, N; Yao, L; Zhang, ZG				Liu, Tengjun; Huang, Gan; Jiang, Ning; Yao, Lin; Zhang, Zhiguo			Reduce brain computer interface inefficiency by combining sensory motor rhythm and movement-related cortical potential features	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI inefficiency; sensory motor rhythm; movement-related cortical potential; feature combination	IMAGERY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; HAND; CLASSIFICATION; COMPONENTS; PATTERNS; FILTERS; STROKE	Objective. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) inefficiency indicates that there would be 10% to 50% of users are unable to operate Motor-Imagery-based BCI systems. Importantly, the almost all previous studieds on BCI inefficiency were based on tests of Sensory Motor Rhythm (SMR) feature. In this work, we assessed the occurrence of BCI inefficiency with SMR and Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) features.Approach. A pool of datasets of resting state and movements related EEG signals was recorded with 93 subjects during 2 sessions in separated days. Two methods, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and template matching, were used for SMR and MRCP feature extraction, and a winner-take-all strategy was applied to assess pattern recognition with posterior probabilities from Linear Discriminant Analysis to combine SMR and MRCP features.Main results. The results showed that the two types of features showed high complementarity, in line with their weak intercorrelation. In the subject group with poor accuracies (< 70%) by SMR feature in the two-class problem (right foot vs. right hand), the combination of SMR and MRCP features improved the averaged accuracy from 62% to 79%. Importantly, accuracies obtained by feature combination exceeded the inefficiency threshold.Significance. The feature combination of SMR and MRCP is not new in BCI decoding, but the large scale and repeatable study on BCI inefficiency assessment by using SMR and MRCP features is novel. MRCP feature provides the similar classification accuracies on the two subject groups with poor (< 70%) and good (> 90%) accuracies by SMR feature. These results suggest that the combination of SMR and MRCP features may be a practical approach to reduce BCI inefficiency. While, 'BCI inefficiency' might be more aptly called 'SMR inefficiency' after this study.

However, medicine and data science are not synchronized. Oftentimes, researchers with a strong data science background do not understand the clinical challenges, while on the other hand, physicians do not know the capacity and limitation of state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The difficulty boils down to the lack of a common interface between two highly intelligent communities due to the privacy concerns and the disciplinary gap. The School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI) at UTHealth is a pilot in connecting both worlds to promote interdisciplinary research. Recently, the Center for Secure Artificial Intelligence For hEalthcare (SAFE) at SBMI is organizing a series of machine learning healthcare hackathons for real-world clinical challenges. We hosted our first Hackathon themed centered around Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy and finding ways to recognize the warning signs. This community effort demonstrated that interdisciplinary discussion and productive competition has significantly increased the accuracy of warning sign detection compared to the previous work, and ultimately showing a potential of this hackathon as a platform to connect the two communities of data science and medicine.

These measured data can be used to construct a model via machine learning techniques to predict the occurrence of a certain cognitive behavior or brain disease. The difficulty of this prediction problem can be summarized in two points: first, the size of the dataset is very small due to the small number of subjects (i.e., patients) who can contribute to these research-based experiments. Second, the size of the feature vector resulted from these medical tools is very large compared to the few number of samples that were collected. One possible way to overcome these obstacles is to develop a feature generation methodology that can produce a small-sized and descriptive feature vector that may improve the overall prediction performance. Motivated by these considerations, this paper proposes a novel feature generation methodology termed Voxel Weight Matrix (VWM) method. This feature generation technique can transform the original high-dimensional feature vector to a two-dimensional discriminative feature domain. The main contribution of this feature generation technique is its ability to represent the statistical measures of the original feature vector via two-dimensional feature vector. After generating the VWM-based feature set, various classification tools such as logistic regression (LR) models and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for cognitive state prediction based on publicly available fMRI dataset called state/plus dataset. The classification models with the proposed VWM features outperformed the best two reported prediction models associated with the star/plus dataset with an average accuracy of 99.8%. To further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature generation methodology, another publicly available Electroencephalography (EEG) dataset are used for Epileptic Seizure Prediction.

In connection with neural electrical activities, there is a very limited study using graph theory for seizure detection. In this work, a complete regular weighted undirected graph has been constructed in which the nodes are selected based on the variance among different channels of EEG signals, whereas weights of the edges are assigned based on the phase synchronization between associated nodes. Further, several properties of the graph have been extracted and used as feature sets to perform classification tasks. The well-known classifier kNN has been applied for classification. In addition, principal component analysis has been used to reduce the dimension of feature sets that leads to improving the analysis and classification performance. The experimental analysis has been performed using EEG signals from the PhysioNet database for three cases - pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved classification accuracy by up to 100%. The other two parameters' sensitivity and specificity are approximately 100%. The results demonstrate the usability and reliability of the proposed idea.

A machine-learning algorithm for neonatal seizure recognition: a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial	LANCET CHILD & ADOLESCENT HEALTH			English	Article							INTEROBSERVER AGREEMENT; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; EEG; BURDEN; CARE	Background Despite the availability of continuous conventional electroencephalography (cEEG), accurate diagnosis of neonatal seizures is challenging in clinical practice. Algorithms for decision support in the recognition of neonatal seizures could improve detection. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of an automated seizure detection algorithm called Algorithm for Neonatal Seizure Recognition (ANSeR). Methods This multicentre, randomised, two-arm, parallel, controlled trial was done in eight neonatal centres across Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. Neonates with a corrected gestational age between 36 and 44 weeks with, or at significant risk of, seizures requiring EEG monitoring, received cEEG plus ANSeR linked to the EEG monitor displaying a seizure probability trend in real time (algorithm group) or cEEG monitoring alone (nonalgorithm group). The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and false detection rate) of health-care professionals to identify neonates with electrographic seizures and seizure hours with and without the support of the ANSeR algorithm. Neonates with data on the outcome of interest were included in the analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02431780. Findings Between Feb 13, 2015, and Feb 7, 2017, 132 neonates were randomly assigned to the algorithm group and 132 to the non-algorithm group. Six neonates were excluded (four from the algorithm group and two from the non-algorithm group). Electrographic seizures were present in 32 (25.0%) of 128 neonates in the algorithm group and 38 (29.2%) of 130 neonates in the non-algorithm group. For recognition of neonates with electrographic seizures, sensitivity was 81.3% (95% CI 66.7-93.3) in the algorithm group and 89.5% (78.4-97.5) in the non-algorithm group; specificity was 84.4% (95% CI 76.9-91.0) in the algorithm group and 89.1% (82.5-94.7) in the non-algorithm group; and the false detection rate was 36.6% (95% CI 22.7-52.1) in the algorithm group and 22.7% (11.6-35.9) in the non-algorithm group. We identified 659 h in which seizures occurred (seizure hours): 268 h in the algorithm versus 391 h in the nonalgorithm group. The percentage of seizure hours correctly identified was higher in the algorithm group than in the non-algorithm group (177 [66.0%; 95% CI 53.8-77.3] of 268 h vs 177 [45.3%; 34.5-58.3] of 391 h; difference 20.8% [3.6-37.1]). No significant differences were seen in the percentage of neonates with seizures given at least one inappropriate antiseizure medication (37.5% [95% CI 25.0 to 56.3] vs 31.6% [21.1 to 47.4]; difference 5.9% [-14.0 to 26.3]). Interpretation ANSeR, a machine-learning algorithm, is safe and able to accurately detect neonatal seizures. Although the algorithm did not enhance identification of individual neonates with seizures beyond conventional EEG, recognition of seizure hours was improved with use of ANSeR. The benefit might be greater in less experienced centres, but further study is required. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sujatha, K				Sujatha, Krishnamoorthy			Automatic epilepsy detection using hybrid decomposition with multi class support vector method	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy; Multi class support vector method; Signal decomposition		The epilepsy has been detected from the electroencephalogram (EEG) by utilizing the complex wavelet transform with support vector machine. These methods successfully examine each and every frequency in the EEG signal for detecting the epilepsy with effective manner because epilepsy is one of the most important brain abnormalities which affect the entire brain function. The epilepsy is occurring due to the brain stroke, lack of blood flow, brain fever and so on, these lead to create the number of human deaths. So, the brain epilepsy needs to be analyzed and it has to be detected for improving the epilepsy recognition rate. But the major problem with the epilepsy recognition is the accuracy and efficiency of the classifier because of the traditional approximation entropy only extracts the minimum number of features which is difficult to detect the epilepsy with effective manner. These problems increase the false classification rate while analyzing the brain features. So, brain abnormalities has been automatically recognized by using the various machine learning steps like preprocessing, signal decomposition, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. In this research, the brain Epilepsy is recognized by applying the Hybrid Multi Class Support Vector Machine (HMCSVM). Then the performance of the system is analyzed using the experimental results and discussions.

The best assessment of the depth of anesthesia is commonly thought to be the one made by the doctor in charge of the patient. This evaluation is based on the integration of several parameters including epidemiological, pharmacological and physiological data. By developing a protocol to record synchronously all these parameters we aim at having this evaluation made by an algorithm. Our hypothesis was that the standard parameters recorded during anesthesia (without EEG) could provide a good insight into the consciousness level of the patient. We developed a complete solution for high-resolution longitudinal follow-up of patients during anesthesia. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was trained on the database in order to predict and assess states based on four physiological variables that were adjusted to the consciousness level: Heart Rate (HR), Mean Blood Pressure (MeanBP) Respiratory Rate (RR), and AA Inspiratory Concentration (AAFi) all without using EEG recordings. Patients undergoing general anesthesia for hernial inguinal repair were included after informed consent. The algorithm was tested on 30 patients. The percentage of error to identify the actual state among Awake, LOC, Anesthesia, ROC and Emergence was 18%. This protocol constitutes the very first step on the way towards a multimodal approach of anesthesia. The fact that our first classifier already demonstrated a good predictability is very encouraging for the future. Indeed, this first model was merely a proof of concept to encourage research ways in the field of machine learning and anesthesia.

Human functional magnetic resonance imaging and monkey electrophysiology studies have identified brain regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), composing a value system. In the present study, in an effort to bridge across species and techniques, we investigated the neural representation of value ratings in 36 people with epilepsy, using intracranial electroencephalography. We found that subjective value was positively reflected in both vmPFC and lOFC high-frequency activity, plus several other brain regions, including the hippocampus. We then demonstrated that subjective value could be decoded (1) in pre-stimulus activity, (2) for various categories of items, (3) even during a distractive task and (4) as both linear and quadratic signals (encoding both value and confidence). Thus, our findings specify key functional properties of neural value signals (anticipation, generality, automaticity, quadraticity), which might provide insights into human irrational choice behaviors. Lopez-Persem et al. used intracranial recordings in people with epilepsy to uncover key functional properties of neural value signals that might explain irrational choice behavior.

Preserved performance monitoring and error detection in left hemisphere stroke	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Stroke; Cognitive control; EEG; Multivariate pattern analysis; Event-related potentials	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSE CONFLICT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ERP COMPONENTS; NEURAL SYSTEM; ANOSOGNOSIA; LESIONS; AWARENESS; ATTENTION; COMPLEX	Depending on the lesion site, a stroke typically affects various aspects of cognitive control. While executing a task, the performance monitoring system constantly compares an intended action plan with the executed action and thereby registers inaccurate actions in case of any mismatch. When errors occur, the performance monitoring system signals the need for more cognitive control, which is most efficient when the subject notices errors rather than processing them subconsciously. The current study aimed to investigate performance monitoring and error detection in a large sample of patients with left hemisphere (LH) stroke. In addition to clinical and neuropsychological tests, 24 LH stroke patients and 32 healthy age-matched controls performed a Go/Nogo task with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. This set-up enabled us to compare performance monitoring at the behavioral and the neural level. EEG data were analyzed using event-related potentials [ERPs; e.g., the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) and error positivity (Pe)] and additionally more sensitive whole-brain multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA). We hypothesized that LH stroke patients would show behavioural deficits in error detection when compared to healthy controls, mirrored by differences in neural signals, in particular reflected in the Pe component. Interestingly, despite clinically relevant cognitive deficits (e.g., aphasia and apraxia) including executive dysfunction (trail making test), we did not observe any behavioral impairments related to performance monitoring and error processing in the current LH stroke patients. Patients also showed similar results for Ne/ERN and Pe components, compared to the control group, and a highly similar prediction of errors from multivariate signals. ERP abnormalities during stimulus processing (i.e., N2 and P3) demonstrated the specificity of these findings in the current LH stroke patients. In contrast to previous studies, by employing a relatively large patient sample, a well-controlled experimental paradigm with a standardized error signaling procedure, and advanced data analysis, we were able to show that performance monitoring (of simple actions) is a preserved cognitive control function in LH stroke patients that might constitute a useful resource in rehabilitative therapies for relearning impeded functions.

Different levels of concentration and mental representations of each sport will reflect on brainwaves. The related brainwave researches of sports' field are applying scientific analysis to provide quantitative data, which provide researchers, coaches, and players to understand the psychological states of athletes during sports. Obviously, the performance of certain sports is related to the. frequency of brainwave, the psychological states of players in different sports can be analysed with other frequencies. The proposed method in this study can be used as a prototype of high potential players' selection system in the future or can be used as adjusting the mental state for active athletes to improve training efficiency and performance. This study aims to establish classification model of sports by analysing electroencephalogram (EEG) of athletes with data mining techniques. In data collection, collects the EEG with pressure of the athletes with filling out the questionnaires in limited time. In data analysis, applies the Butterworth low-pass filter to remove noise before converts the EEG to power spectral density by Fast Fourier Transform, then extracts 24 features according to frequency bands and statistical methods as the basis of the classification model. Last but not least, constructs the classification model by machine learning algorithms such as C4.5 and CART and compares the accuracy of different classifiers. By means of proposed sports classification model coordinated with other biotechnologies such as electrocardiogram and electromyogram, which can help athletes and prospective athletes to well understand psychological conditions and choose more appropriate sports.

Application of deep learning to improve sleep scoring of wrist actigraphy	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Wrist actigraphy; Artificial intelligence (AI); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Time series classification; Long-short-term memory (LSTM); Machine learning	WAKE IDENTIFICATION; PARAMETERS; RELIABILITY	Background: Estimation of sleep parameters by wrist actigraphy is highly dependent on performance of the interpretative algorithm (IA) that converts movement data into sleep/wake scores. Research questions: (1) Does the actigraphy mode of operation -Proportional Integrating Measure (PIM) or Zero Crossing Mode (ZCM), responsive respectively to intensity and frequency of movements- impact sleep scoring; and (2) Can a better performing sleep scoring IA be developed by a deep learning approach combining PIM/ZCM data. Study design and Methods: ZCM and PIM plus electroencephalographic (EEG) data of 40 healthy adults (17 female, mean age: 26.7 years) were obtained from a single in-home nighttime sleep study. Effect of mode of operation was first evaluated by applying several classic deep learning models to PIM only, ZCM only, and combined ZCM/PIM data. After, a novel deep learning model was developed incorporating combined ZCM/PIM data, and its performance was compared with existing Cole-Kripke, rescored ColeKripke, Sadeh, and UCSD lAs. Results: Relative to the EEG reference, ZCM/PIM combined mode produced higher agreement of scoring sleep/wake epochs than only ZCM or PIM modes. The proposed novel deep learning model showed 87.7% accuracy (0.2-1% higher than the other IAs), 94.1% sensitivity (0.7-4.3% lower than the other IAs), 64.0% specificity (9.9-21.5% higher than the other IAs), and 59.9% Kappa agreement (similar to 6.9-11.6% higher than other IAs) in detecting sleep epochs. The proposed deep learning model did not differ significantly from the reference EEG in estimating sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE). Amount of bias and minimum detectable change in estimating SOL, WASO, TST and SE by the deep learning model was smaller than other four IAs.

NDD could cause gait abnormalities so that to screen NDD using gait signal is feasible. The research aim of this study is to develop an NDD classification algorithm via gait force (GF) using multiscale sample entropy (MSE) and machine learning models. The Physionet NDD gait database is utilized to validate the proposed algorithm. In the preprocessing stage of the proposed algorithm, new signals were generated by taking one and two times of differential on GF and are divided into various time windows (10/20/30/60-sec). In feature extraction, the GF signal is used to calculate statistical and MSE values. Owing to the imbalanced nature of the Physionet NDD gait database, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used to rebalance data of each class. Support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) were used as the classifiers. The best classification accuracies for the healthy controls (HC) vs. Parkinson's disease (PD), HC vs. Huntington's disease (HD), HC vs. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), PD vs. HD, PD vs. ALS, HD vs. ALS, HC vs. PD vs. HD vs. ALS, were 99.90%, 99.80%, 100%, 99.75%, 99.90%, 99.55%, and 99.68% under 10-sec time window with KNN. This study successfully developed an NDD gait classification based on MSE and machine learning classifiers.

Many scientists have been working hard to explore the cause of epilepsy and seek the prevention and treatment. In the field of machine learning, epileptic diagnosis based on EEG signal has been a very hot research topic; many methods have been proposed, and considerable progress has been achieved. However, resorting the epileptic diagnosis techniques based on EEG to the reality applications still faces many challenges. Low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is one of the most important methodological challenges for EEG data collection and analysis. This paper discusses an automated diagnostic method for epileptic detection using a Frechet Mean embedded in the Grassmann manifold analysis. Frechet mean-based Grassmann discriminant analysis (FMGDA) algorithm to implement the EEG data dimensionality reduction and clustering task. The method is resorted to reduce Grassmann data from high-dimensional data to a relative lower-dimensional data and maximize between-class distance and minimize within-class distance simultaneously. Every EEG feature is mapped into the Grassmann manifold space first and then resort the Frechet mean to represent the clustering center to carry out the clustering work. We designed a detailed experimental scheme to test the performance of our proposed algorithm; the test is assessed on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results have delivered that our approach leads to a significant improvement over state-of-the-art Grassmann manifold methods.

In clinical practice, it is still a challenging problem to identify schizophrenia-related brain patterns due to the lack of objective physiological data support and a unified data analysis method, physicians can only use the subjective experience to distinguish schizophrenia patients and healthy people, which may easily lead to misdiagnosis. In this study, we designed an optimized data-preprocessing method accompanied with techniques of general linear model feature extraction, independent sample t-test feature selection and support vector machine to identify a set of robust fNIRS pattern features as a biomarker to discriminate schizophrenia patients and healthy people. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed combination way of data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection and support vector machine classification can effectively identify schizophrenia patients and the healthy people with a leave-one-out-cross-validation classification accuracy of 89.5%.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is when this depression reaches to a larger extent, when depression persists for two weeks or more. Sadly, many individuals of our society tend to neglect depression and refuse to label it as a mental disease and has a tendency to not seek medical help. Not only this, they are being curbed because of the few or very limited biological indicators for depression identification. Our main objective is to develop a non-intrusive approach that will detect and differentiate brain signals of patients with NIDD from healthy patients. We were able to obtain an optimized model with an accuracy of (82%). Primarily, we obtained a raw EEG dataset upon research and performed noise removal on them. Afterwards we extracted relevant features for depression detection. Finally, we entered these features into three classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive-Hayes (NB) classifier. To check the accuracy and precision, we performed a ten-fold cross validation on them. Hopefully, our results will encourage and motivate people suffering from this to seek the proper and effective medical help and to eradicate the negative stigma around it.

Furthermore, these classifications can be used as feedback for a learning-based BCI, to allow real or virtual robots to find quasi-optimal routes to a target. However, when navigating it is important not only to know we are moving in the right direction toward a target, but also to know when we have reached it. We asked participants to observe a virtual robot performing a 1-dimensional navigation task. We recorded EEG and then performed neurophysiological analysis on the responses to two classes of correct movements: those that moved closer to the target but did not reach it, and those that did reach the target. Further, we used a stepwise linear classifier on time-domain features to differentiate the classes on a single-trial basis. A second data set was also used to further test this single-trial classification. We found that the amplitude of the P300 was significantly greater in cases where the movement reached the target. Interestingly, we were able to classify the EEG signals evoked when observing the two classes of correct movements against each other with mean overall accuracy of 66.5 and 68.0% for the two data sets, with greater than chance levels of accuracy achieved for all participants. As a proof of concept, we have shown that it is possible to classify the EEG responses in observing these different correct movements against each other using single-trial EEG. This could be used as part of a learning-based BCI and opens a new door toward a more autonomous BCI navigation system.

Recently developed implantable therapeutic devices aim to prevent symptoms by applying acute electrical stimulation to the seizure-generating brain region in response to activity detected by on-device machine learning hardware. Many training algorithms require an equal number of examples for each target class (e.g. normal activity and seizures), and performance can suffer if this condition is not satisfied. In the case of epilepsy, poor performance can cause seizures to be missed, or stimulation to be applied erroneously. As there is an abundance of normal (interictal) data in clinical EEG recordings, but seizures are rare events (less than 1% of the dataset), the data available for training is severely imbalanced. There are several conventional pre-processing methods used to address imbalanced class learning, such as down-sampling of the majority class and up-sampling of the minority class, but each have performance drawbacks. This paper presents an improved method which involves reducing the majority class down to the most effective interictal outlier samples. Outliers are determined by using Exponentially Decaying Memory Signal Energy (EDMSE) features with Isolation Forests and an ANOVA-based method, which involves comparing a moving feature window to a baseline reference window. Outlier-based sampling is tested with two classifiers (KNN and Logistic Regression) and achieves higher accuracy (similar to 2% increase) and fewer false positives (similar to 38% decrease), along with a lower latency (similar to 3 seconds shorter) compared to conventional training set pre-processing methods.

Distant Sensor Prediction of Event-Related Potentials	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Electrodes; Standards; Artificial neural networks; Mathematical model; Brain modeling; Electric potential; Distant-sensing; brain vital signs; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potentials (ERP); artificial neural network; machine learning	BRAIN	Objective: The ability to measure event-related potentials (ERPs) as practical, portable brain vital signs is limited by the physical locations of electrodes. Standard electrode locations embedded within the hair result in challenges to obtaining quality signals in a rapid manner. Moreover, these sites require electrode gel, which can be inconvenient. As electrical activity in the brain is spatially volume distributed, it should be possible to predict ERPs from distant sensor locations at easily accessible mastoid and forehead scalp regions. Methods: An artificial neural network was trained on ERP signals recorded from below hairline electrode locations (Tp9, Tp10, Af7, Af8 referenced to Fp1, Fp2) to predict signals recorded at the ideal Cz location. Results: The model resulted in mean improvements in intraclass correlation coefficient relative to control for all stimulus types (Standard Tones: +9.74%, Deviant Tones: +3.23%, Congruent Words: +15.25%, Incongruent Words: +25.43%) and decreases in RMS Error (Standard Tones: -26.72%, Deviant Tones: -17.80%, Congruent Words: -28.78%, Incongruent Words: -29.61%) compared to the individual distant channels. Measured vs predicted ERP amplitudes were highly and significantly correlated with control for the N100 (R = 0.5, p(adj) < 0.05), P300 (R = 0.75, p(adj) < 0.01), and N400 (R = 0.75, p(adj) < 0.01) ERPs. Conclusion: ERP waveforms at distant channels can be combined using a neural network autoencoder to model the control channel features with better precision than those at individual distant channels. This is the first demonstration of feasibility of predicting evoked potentials and brain vital signs using signals recorded from more distant, practical locations. Significance: This solves a key engineering challenge for applications that require portability, comfort, and speed of measurement as design priorities for measurement of event-related potentials across a range of individuals, settings, and circumstances.

In this study, we investigated the frequency-specific FC of MDD patients exposed to conditions of music perception using ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG). Methods: First, we applied the phase lag index (PLI) method to calculate the connectivity matrices and graph theory-based methods to measure the topology of brain networks across different frequency bands. Then, classification methods were adopted to identify the most discriminate frequency band for the diagnosis of MDD. Results: During music perception, MDD patients exhibited a decreased connectivity pattern in the delta band but an increased connectivity pattern in the beta band. Healthy people showed a left hemisphere-dominant phenomenon, but MDD patients did not show such a lateralized effect. Support vector machine (SVM) achieved the best classification performance in the beta frequency band with an accuracy of 89.7%, sensitivity of 89.4% and specificity of 89.9%. Conclusions: MDD patients exhibited an altered FC in delta and beta bands, and the beta band showed a superiority in the diagnosis of MDD.

However, EEG signals recorded in multi-channel mode usually contain many redundant and artifact information. Therefore, selecting a few effective channels from whole channels may be a means to improve the performance of MI-based BCI systems. We proposed a channel evaluation parameter called position priori weight-permutation entropy (PPWPE), which include amplitude information and position information of a channel. According to the order of PPWPE values, we initially selected half of the channels with large PPWPE value from all sampling electrode channels. Then, the binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) was used in searching a channel combination that will be used in determining an optimal channel combination. The features were extracted by common spatial pattern (CSP) method from the final selected channels, and the classifier was trained by support vector machine. The PPWPE + BGSA + CSP channel selection method is validated on two data sets. Results showed that the PPWPE + BGSA + CSP method obtained better mean classification accuracy (88.0% vs. 57.5% for Data set 1 and 91.1% vs. 79.4% for Data set 2) than All-C + CSP method. The PPWPE + BGSA + CSP method can achieve higher classification in fewer channels selected. This method has great potential to improve the performance of MI-based BCI systems.

The non-invasive nature of peripheral physiological signal measurement via wearables enables ecologically valid long-term monitoring. These peripheral signal measurements can be used in real-time in many ways including health and emotion classification. This paper investigates the utility of peripheral physiological signals for emotion recognition using the publicly available DEAP database. Using this database (which contains electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and peripheral signals), this paper compares eight machine learning models in the classification of valence and arousal emotion dimensions. These were applied to the peripheral physiological signals only. These models operate on three groupings of the peripheral data: (i) the raw peripheral physiological signals; (ii) individual feature sets extracted from each peripheral signal; and (iii) a fusion data set made of the combined features from the individual peripheral signals. The results indicate that support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression give the best recognition results on all three data groups considered. The feature fusion data set, which is made up by fusing all the features from the peripheral signals, gives the best recognition accuracy on both valence and arousal dimensions. In addition, subject dependency for emotion classification from peripheral signals is examined and significant individual variability is observed. The recognition rate varies between each participant from 10% to 87.5%.

Conventional stress assessment methods are highly subjective and tedious and tend to lack accuracy. Machine-learning (ML)-based computer-aided diagnosis systems can be used to assess the mental state with reasonable accuracy, but they require offline processing and feature extraction, rendering them unsuitable for real-time applications. This paper presents a real-time mental stress assessment approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN-based approach afforded real-time mental stress assessment with an accuracy as high as 96%, the sensitivity of 95%, and specificity of 97%. The proposed approach is compared with state-of-the-art ML techniques in terms of accuracy, time utilisation, and quality of features.

In this study, we collected EEG signals related to grasp motions. Five healthy subjects participated in this experiment. They executed and imagined five sustained-grasp actions. We proposed a novel data augmentation method that increases the amount of training data using labels obtained from electromyogram (EMG) signals analysis. For implementation, we recorded EEG and EMG simultaneously. The data augmentation over the original EEG data concluded higher classification accuracy than other competitors. As a result, we obtained the average classification accuracy of 52.49(+/- 8.74)% for motor execution (ME) and 40.36(+/- 3.39)% for motor imagery (MI). These are 9.30% and 6.19% higher, respectively than the result of the comparable methods. Moreover, the proposed method could minimize the need for the calibration session, which reduces the practicality of most BCIs. This result is encouraging, and the proposed method could potentially be used in future applications such as a BCI-driven robot control for handling various daily use objects.

Several neuropsychiatric disorders were shown to be associated with altered DFC, with schizophrenia (SZ) being one of the most intensely studied among such conditions. Here we analyzed resting-state electroencephalography recordings of 14 SZ patients and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). We reconstructed dynamic functional networks from delta band (0.5-4 Hz) neural activity and captured their spatiotemporal dynamics in various global network topological measures. The acquired network measure time series were made subject to dynamic analyses including multifractal analysis and entropy estimation. Besides group-level comparisons, we built a classifier to explore the potential of DFC features in classifying individual cases. We found stronger delta-band connectivity, as well as increased variance of DFC in SZ patients. Surrogate data testing verified the true multifractal nature of DFC in SZ, with patients expressing stronger long-range autocorrelation and degree of multifractality when compared to controls. Entropy analysis indicated reduced temporal complexity of DFC in SZ. When using these indices as features, an overall cross-validation accuracy surpassing 89% could be achieved in classifying individual cases. Our results imply that dynamic features of DFC such as its multifractal properties and entropy are potent markers of altered neural dynamics in SZ and carry significant potential not only in better understanding its pathophysiology but also in improving its diagnosis. The proposed framework is readily applicable for neuropsychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia.

Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is utilized for highly parallel computing for SVM training. From the algorithm aspect, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) and low-rank approximation are exploited to reduce overall computational complexity by 99.4 while also reducing memory storage by 90.4. For hardware optimization, overall hardware complexity is reduced by 87 through a hardware-shared configurable coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC)-based processing element array. Parallel rotations and folded structure for the approximate Jacobi method reduce overall training latency by 98.6. The chip achieves a detection performance with a 96.6 accuracy and a 0.28/h false alarm rate within 0.71 s with the power dissipation of 1.9 mW. The proposed SVM processor achieves the shortest detection latency compared with the state-of-the-art seizure detectors. It also supports real-time model adaptation with a latency of 0.78 s. Compared with previous designs, this work achieves a $22\times $ higher throughput and a $162\times $ higher energy efficiency for SVM training.

In this sense, the brain activity pattern is an interesting candidate, since each individual has shown to possess a particular one. This document presents the results obtained by using the standard deviation of electroencephalographic signals as a feature and a naive Bayes classifier for the aforementioned authentication purpose. The proposed methodology is composed of two stages: in the first, a selection of the most suitable frequency bands is performed. In the second, the previously selected bands are used for authentication. In order to discover such promising frequency bands and to subsequently evaluate the performance of the whole methodology, the Data Set IIb from BCI competition IV was used. As it will be shown, the total success rate for all evaluated subjects was higher than 0.85 and, in most cases, higher than 0.95.

Some of these new methods try to address the well-known PE weaknesses, such as its focus only on ordinal and not on amplitude information, and the possible detrimental impact of equal values found in subsequences. Other new methods address less specific weaknesses, such as the PE results' dependence on input parameter values, a common problem found in many entropy calculation methods. The lack of discriminating power among classes in some cases is also a generic problem when entropy measures are used for data series classification. This last problem is the one specifically addressed in the present study. Toward that purpose, the classification performance of the standard PE method was first assessed by conducting several time series classification tests over a varied and diverse set of data. Then, this performance was reassessed using a new Shannon Entropy normalisation scheme proposed in this paper: divide the relative frequencies in PE by the number of different ordinal patterns actually found in the time series, instead of by the theoretically expected number. According to the classification accuracy obtained, this last approach exhibited a higher class discriminating power. It was capable of finding significant differences in six out of seven experimental datasets-whereas the standard PE method only did in four-and it also had better classification accuracy. It can be concluded that using the additional information provided by the number of forbidden/found patterns, it is possible to achieve a higher discriminating power than using the classical PE normalisation method. The resulting algorithm is also very similar to that of PE and very easy to implement.

Data acquisition of timed-up and go test with older adults: accelerometer, magnetometer, electrocardiography and electroencephalography sensors' data	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Health; Timed-up and go test; Sensors; Accelerometer; Mobile devices; Magnetometer; Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography		We present a dataset related to the acquisition of different sensors data during the performance of the Timed-Up and Go test with the mobile device positioned in a waist-band for the acquisition of accelerometer and magnetometer data, and a BITalino device positioned in a chest band for the acquisition of Electrocardiography and Electroencephalography for further processing. The data acquired from the BITalino device is acquired simultaneously by a Bluetooth connection with the same mobile application. The data was acquired in five institutions, including Centro Comunitario das Lameiras, Lar Nossa Senhora de Fatima, Centro Comunitario das Minas da Panasqueira, Lar da Misericordia da Santa Casa da Misericordia do Fundao, and Lar da Aldeia de Joanes da Santa Casa da Misericordia do Fundao from Fundao and Covilha municipalities (Portugal). This article describes the data acquired from a several subjects from the different institutions for the acquisition of accelerometer and magnetometer data, where each person performed the Timed-Up and Go test three times, where each output from the sensors was acquired with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. Related to the data acquired by the sensors connected to the BITalino device, 31 persons performed the different experiments related to the Timed-Up and Go Test. Following the data acquired from Electroencephalography and Electrocardiography sensors, only the data acquired from 14 individuals was considered valid. The data acquired by a BITalino device has a sampling rate of 100 Hz. These data can be reused for testing machine learning methods for the evaluation of the performance of the Timed-Up and Go test with older adults. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, Simulator Sickness (SS) still represents a significant problem for its wider adoption. Currently, the most common way to detect SS is using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). SSQ is a subjective measurement and is inadequate for real-time applications such as VR games. This research aims to investigate how to use machine learning techniques to detect SS based on in-game characters' and users' physiological data during gameplay in VR games. To achieve this, we designed an experiment to collect such data with three types of games. We trained a Long Short-Term Memory neural network with the dataset eye-tracking and character movement data to detect SS in real-time. Our results indicate that, in VR games, our model is an accurate and efficient way to detect SS in real-time.

To this aim, monitoring the electrical activity of brain through Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as the prime choice for BCI systems. To discover the underlying and specific features of brain signals for different mental tasks, a considerable number of research works are developed based on statistical and data-driven techniques. However, a major bottleneck in development of practical and commercial BCI systems is their limited performance when the number of mental tasks for classification is increased. In this work, we propose a new EEG processing and feature extraction paradigm based on Siamese neural networks, which can be conveniently merged and scaled up for multi-class problems. The idea of Siamese networks is to train a double-input neural network based on a contrastive loss-function, which provides the capability of verifying if two input EEG trials are from the same class or not. In this work, a Siamese architecture, which is developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and provides a binary output on the similarity of two inputs, is combined with One vs. Rest (OVR) and One vs. One (OVO) techniques to scale up for multi-class problems. The efficacy of this architecture is evaluated on a 4-class Motor Imagery (MI) dataset from BCI Competition IV2a and the results suggest a promising performance compared to its counterparts.

In this work we propose two new methods. The first is a novel self-organizing model that learns from similarity between features and affects. This method produces a graphical representation of the multidimensional data which may assist the expert analysis. The second method uses extreme learning machines, an emerging artificial neural network model. Aiming for minimum intrusiveness, we use only the heart rate variability, which can be recorded using a small set of sensors. The methods were validated with two datasets. The first is composed of 16 sessions with different participants and was used to evaluate the models in a classification task. The second one was the publicly available Remote Collaborative and Affective Interaction (RECOLA) dataset, which was used for dimensional affect estimation. The performance evaluation used the kappa score, unweighted average recall and the concordance correlation coefficient. The concordance coefficient on the RECOLA test partition was 0.421 in arousal and 0.321 in valence. Results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art models on the same data and provides new ways to analyze affective states.

Methods: In this study, double-density dual-tree discrete wavelet transformation (DDDTDWT) was used for decomposing the image, and marginal Fisher analysis (MFA) was used for reducing the dimension. A proposed model on unprocessed EEG models was used on monitored training of 5-group sleep phase forecasting. Results: Our network includes a 14-row structure, and a 30-s period was extracted as input in order to be categorized which is followed by second and third period prior to the first 30-s period. Another consecutive period for temporal tissue was added which is not required to a signal preprocess and attribute data derivation phase. Our means of evaluating and improving our approach was to use input from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), which is a large study field aimed at using research from numerous centers and people and which studies the records of specialist-rated polysomnography (PSG). Performance measures could reach the desired level, which is a precision of 0.87 and a Cohen's kappa of 0.81. Conclusions: The use of a large, collaborative study of specialist graders can enhance the likelihood of good globalization. Overall, the novel approach learned by our network showcases the models based on each category.

Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition has developed a lot due to the application of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and its effectiveness compared to body expressions and other physiological signals. Despite significant progress in affective computing, emotion recognition is still an unexplored problem. This paper introduced Logistic Regression (LR) with Gaussian kernel and Laplacian prior for EEG-based emotion recognition. The Gaussian kernel enhances the EEG data separability in the transformed space. The Laplacian prior promotes the sparsity of learned LR regressors to avoid over-specification. The LR regressors are optimized using the logistic regression via variable splitting and augmented Lagrangian (LORSAL) algorithm. For simplicity, the introduced method is noted as LORSAL. Experiments were conducted on the dataset for emotion analysis using EEG, physiological and video signals (DEAP). Various spectral features and features by combining electrodes (power spectral density (PSD), differential entropy (DE), differential asymmetry (DASM), rational asymmetry (RASM), and differential caudality (DCAU)) were extracted from different frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Total) with EEG signals. The Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), linear LR with L1-regularization (LR_L1), linear LR with L2-regularization (LR_L2) were used for comparison in the binary emotion classification for valence and arousal. LORSAL obtained the best classification accuracies (77.17% and 77.03% for valence and arousal, respectively) on the DE features extracted from total frequency bands. This paper also investigates the critical frequency bands in emotion recognition. The experimental results showed the superiority of Gamma and Beta bands in classifying emotions. It was presented that DE was the most informative and DASM and DCAU had lower computational complexity with relatively ideal accuracies. An analysis of LORSAL and the recently deep learning (DL) methods is included in the discussion. Conclusions and future work are presented in the final section.

Automatically Detected Microsleep Episodes in the Fitness-to-Drive Assessment	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						microsleep episodes; maintenance of wakefulness test; driving simulator; electroencephalography; sleepiness; wake-sleep transition zone; machine learning; fitness to drive	SLEEP LATENCY TEST; WAKEFULNESS TEST; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP; SUBJECTIVE SLEEPINESS; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; LOCAL SLEEP; PERFORMANCE; MAINTENANCE; VIGILANCE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Study Objectives: Microsleep episodes (MSEs) are short fragments of sleep (1-15 s) that can cause dangerous situations with potentially fatal outcomes. In the diagnostic sleep-wake and fitness-to-drive assessment, accurate and early identification of sleepiness is essential. However, in the absence of a standardised definition and a time-efficient scoring method of MSEs, these short fragments are not assessed in clinical routine. Based on data of moderately sleepy patients, we recently developed the Bern continuous and high-resolution wake-sleep (BERN) criteria for visual scoring of MSEs and corresponding machine learning algorithms for automatic MSE detection, both mainly based on the electroencephalogram (EEG). The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between automatically detected MSEs and driving performance in a driving simulator, recorded in parallel with EEG, and to assess algorithm performance for MSE detection in severely sleepy participants. Methods: Maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) and driving simulator recordings of 18 healthy participants, before and after a full night of sleep deprivation, were retrospectively analysed. Performance of automatic detection was compared with visual MSE scoring, following the BERN criteria, in MWT recordings of 10 participants. Driving performance was measured by the standard deviation of lateral position and the occurrence of off-road events. Results: In comparison to visual scoring, automatic detection of MSEs in participants with severe sleepiness showed good performance (Cohen's kappa = 0.66). The MSE rate in the MWT correlated with the latency to the first MSE in the driving simulator (r(s) = -0.54, p < 0.05) and with the cumulative MSE duration in the driving simulator (r(s) = 0.62, p < 0.01). No correlations between MSE measures in the MWT and driving performance measures were found. In the driving simulator, multiple correlations between MSEs and driving performance variables were observed. Conclusion: Automatic MSE detection worked well, independent of the degree of sleepiness. The rate and the cumulative duration of MSEs could be promising sleepiness measures in both the MWT and the driving simulator. The correlations between MSEs in the driving simulator and driving performance might reflect a close and time-critical relationship between sleepiness and performance, potentially valuable for the fitness-to-drive assessment.

The brain signals are recorded with the help of electrocorticography (ECoG), Electroencephalogram (EEG). From the brain signal, the abnormal brain functions are a more challenging task. The traditional systems are consuming more time to predict unusual brain patterns. Therefore, in this paper, effective bio-inspired machine learning techniques are utilized to predict the epilepsy seizure from the EEG signal with maximum recognition accuracy. Initially, patient brain images are collected by placing the electrodes on their scalp. From the brain signal, different features are extracted that are analyzed with the help of the Krill Herd algorithm for selecting the best features. The selected features are processed using an artificial alga optimized general Adversarial Networks. The network recognizes the intricate and abnormal seizure patterns. Then the discussed state-of-art methods are examined simulation results.

Thus, medical researchers increasingly turn to weaker, noisier sources of supervision, such as leveraging extractions from unstructured text reports to supervise image classification. A key challenge in weak supervision is combining sources of information that may differ in quality and have correlated errors. Recently, a statistical theory of weak supervision called data programming has shown promise in addressing this challenge. Data programming now underpinsmany deployed machine-learning systems in the technology industry, even for critical applications. We propose a new technique for applying data programming to the problem of cross-modal weak supervision in medicine, wherein weak labels derived from an auxiliary modality (e.g., text) are used to train models over a different target modality (e.g., images). We evaluate our approach on diverse clinical tasks via direct comparison to institution-scale, hand-labeled data-sets. We find that our supervision technique increases model performance by up to 6 points area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) over baseline methods by improving both coverage and quality of the weak labels. Our approach yields models that on average perform within 1.75 points ROC-AUC of those supervised with physician-years of hand labeling and outperform those supervised with physician-months of hand labeling by 10.25 points ROC-AUC, while using only person-days of developer time and clinician work-a time saving of 96%. Our results suggest that modern weak supervision techniques such as data programming may enable more rapid development and deployment of clinically useful machine-learning models.

Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is useful for the analysis of nonlinear or nonstationary bio-signals including brainwaves. In this work, a method is proposed for the characterization of attentiveness levels by using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and HHT analysis. Methods Single-channel EEG signals from the frontal area were acquired from participants at different levels of attentiveness and were decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Hilbert transform analysis was applied to each IMF to obtain the marginal frequency spectrum. Then the band powers and spectral entropies (SEs) were selected as the attributes of a support vector machine (SVM) for a two-class classification task. Results Compared with the predictive models of approximate entropy (ApEn) and fast Fourier transform (FFT), the results show that the band powers extracted from IMF2 to IMF5 of alpha\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha$$\end{document} and beta\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\beta$$\end{document} waves and their SE can best discriminate between attentive and relaxed states with the average classification accuracy of 84.80%.

The BCI system needs to be retrained before each time it is used, which is a waste of resources and time. Thus, it is difficult to generalize a fixed classification method for all subjects. Therefore, the transfer learning method proposed in this article, which combines XDAWN spatial filter and Riemannian Geometry classifier (RGC), can achieve offline cross-subject transfer learning in the P300-speller paradigm. The XDAWN spatial filter is used to enhanced the P300 components in the raw signal as well as reduce its dimensions. Then, the Riemannian Geometry Mean (RGM) is used as the reference matrix to perform the affine transformation of the symmetric positive definite (SPD) covariance matrix calculated from the filtered signal, which makes the data from different subjects comparable. Finally, the RGC is used to obtain the result of transfer learning experiments. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on two datasets (Dataset I from real patients and Dataset II from the laboratory). By comparing with two state-of-the-art and classic algorithms in the current BCI field, Ensemble of Support Vector Machine (E-SVM) and Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (SWLDA), the maximum averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score of our algorithm reached 0.836, proving the potential of our proposed algorithm.

While there are numerous choices of data acquisition protocol, the present study is carried out with the least demanding resting-state condition. Motivated by neurophysiological knowledge, a type of novel feature, namely the intrinsic mode correlation (IMCOR), is proposed. It is designed by combining the nonstationary multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) and the concept of brain connectivity. With machine learning classifiers, our system yields promising performance in a 81-class classification (F1 score: 0.99) within a single session. For 32-class cross-session classification, an F1 score of 0.55 is attained. The results suggest that the proposed method might be vulnerable to temporal effects and between-session variability. This study highlights the uniqueness of the proposed non-stationary and connectivity-based feature and demonstrated its success as a biometrics. Further investigation is needed to make the method practically useful.

In this study, an automatic sleep staging method based on hybrid stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed and evaluated using a large-scale dataset of subjects with sleep disorders. Twenty-four features, including temporal and spectrum factors, were extracted from physiological signals and normalized after extracting the features. A variety of hybrid stacked LSTM structures and hidden units were used to determine the most suitable structure and parameters for the automatic sleep staging method. Finally, the proposed method was validated using a large-scale sleep disorder dataset from the PhysioNet Challenge 2018. To validate the robustness of the proposed system, half of the 994 subjects were randomly assigned to the training set, and the other half were assigned to the testing set. The best accuracy and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are 83.07% and 0.78, respectively. The best hybrid stacked structure was LSTM combined with bidirectional LSTM, which has 125 hidden units. In addition, four common sleep indices, including sleep efficiency, sleep onset time, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time, were evaluated. The results, according to the intraclass correlation coefficient, indicated a moderate agreement with the results of the expert. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of conventional machine learning, and it was noted that the hybrid stacked LSTM is a promising solution for automatic sleep staging. In future work, this method may assist clinical staff in reducing the time required for sleep staging.

Statistical dependence between different brain regions measures by functional brain connectivity (FBC). Specific directional effects cannot be considered by FBC, and thus effective brain connectivity (EBC) is used to measure causal dependencies between brain regions. Our main purpose is to provide a reliable automatic seizure detection approach. Methods: In this study, three new methods are provided. Multi-level modular network (MLMN) is proposed based on combining various EBC classification results at different frequencies. Another method named "modular effective neural networks (MENN)." This method combines the classification results of the three different EBCs at a specific frequency. "Modular frequency neural networks (MFNN)" is another method that combines the classification results of specific EBC at seven different frequencies. Results: The mean accuracies of MFNN are 97.14 %, 98.53 %, and 97.91 % using directed transfer function (DTF), directed coherence (DC), and generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC), respectively. By using MENN method, the highest mean accuracy is 98.34 %. Finally, MLMN has the highest mean accuracy, which is equal to 99.43. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is a new method that provides the highest accuracy in comparison to other studies - that used the MIT-CHB database. Conclusion and significance: The knowledge of structure-function relationships between different areas of the brain is necessary for characterizing the underlying dynamics. Hence, features based on EBC can provide a more reliable automatic seizure detection approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite all the successes of deep learning, neural networks of significant depth could not ensure better performance compared to shallow architectures. The approach presented in the article employs this idea, making use of yet shallower, but productive architecture. The main idea of the proposed architecture is based on three points: full-dimension-long 'valid' convolutions, dense connections - combination of layer's input and output and layer reuse. Another aspect addressed in the paper is related to interpretable machine learning. Interpretability is extremely important in medicine, where decisions must be taken on the basis of solid arguments and clear reasons. Being shallow, the architecture could be used for feature selection by interpreting the layers' weights, which allows understanding of the knowledge about the data cumulated in the network's layers. The approach, based on a fuzzy measure, allows using Choquet integral to aggregate the knowledge generated in the layer weights and understanding which features (EEG electrodes) provide the most essential information. The approach allows lowering feature number from 64 to 14 with an insignificant drop of accuracy (less than a percentage point).

A deep learning-based algorithm for detection of cortical arousal during sleep	SLEEP			English	Article						arousal; ECG; machine learning; deep learning; home sleep test	INSUFFICIENT SLEEP; NEURAL-NETWORKS; APNEA; ACTIVATION; HEALTH	Study Objectives: The frequency of cortical arousals is an indicator of sleep quality. Additionally, cortical arousals are used to identify hypopneic events. However, it is inconvenient to record electroencephalogram (EEG) data during home sleep testing. Fortunately, most cortical arousal events are associated with autonomic nervous system activity that could be observed on an electrocardiography (ECG) signal. ECG data have lower noise and are easier to record at home than EEG. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based cortical arousal detection algorithm that uses a single-lead ECG to detect arousal during sleep. Methods: This study included 1,547 polysomnography records that met study inclusion criteria and were selected from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis database. We developed an end-to-end deep learning model consisting of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks which: (1) accepted varying length physiological data; (2) directly extracted features from the raw ECG signal; (3) captured long-range dependencies in the physiological data; and (4) produced arousal probability in 1-s resolution. Results: We evaluated the model on a test set (n = 311). The model achieved a gross area under precision-recall curve score of 0.62 and a gross area under receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.93. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the end-to-end deep learning approach with a single-lead ECG has the potential to be used to accurately detect arousals in home sleep tests.

Unveiling Parkinson's Disease Features from a Primate Model with Deep Neural Networks	2020 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) held as part of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (IEEE WCCI)	JUL 19-24, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc		Parkinson's disease; LFP analysis; deep learning; attribution methods; computational neuroscience	EEG; SIZE	Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with increasing prevalence in the world population and is Characterised by motor and cognitive symptoms. Although cortical EEG readings from PD-affected humans have being commonly used to feed different machine learning frameworks, the directly affected areas are concentrated in a group of sub cortical nuclei and related areas, the so-called motor loop. As those areas may only be directly accessed through invasive procedures, such as Local Field Potential (LFP) measurements, most data collection must rely on animal models. To the best of our knowledge, no neural networks-based analysis centred on LFP data from the motor loop was reported so far. In this work, we trained and evaluated a set of deep neural networks on a dataset recorded from marmoset monkeys, with LFP readings from healthy and parkinsonian subjects. We analysed each trained neural network with respect to its inputs and representations from intermediate layers. CNN and ConvLSTM classifiers were applied, reaching accuracies up to 99.80%, as well as a CNN-based autoencoder, which has also shown to learn PD related representations. The results and analysis provided further insights and foster research on the correlates of Parkinson's Disease.	[Ranieri, Caetano M.; Romero, Roseli A.

Methods: Our algorithm first transforms iEEG time series from each electrode into symbolic local binary pattern codes, from which a holographic distributed representation of the brain state of interest is constructed across all the electrodes and over time in a hyperdimensional space. The representation is used to quickly learn from few seizures, detect their onset, and identify the spatial brain regions that generated them. Results: We assess our algorithm on our dataset that contains 99 short-time iEEG recordings from 16 drug-resistant epilepsy patients being implanted with 36-100 electrodes. For the majority of the patients (ten out of 16), our algorithm quickly learns from one or two seizures and perfectly (100%) generalizes on novel seizures using k-fold cross-validation. For the remaining six patients, the algorithm requires three to six seizures for learning. Our algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art including deep learning algorithms by achieving higher specificity (94.84% versus 94.77%) and macroaveraging accuracy (95.42% versus 94.96%), and 74x lower memory footprint, but slightly higher average latency in detection (15.9 s versus 14.7 s). Moreover, the algorithm can reliably identify (with a p-value < 0.01) the relevant electrodes covering an ictogenic brain region at two levels of granularity: cerebral hemispheres and lobes. Conclusion and significance: Our algorithm provides: 1) a unified method for both learning and classification tasks with end-to-end binary operations; 2) one-shot learning from seizure examples; 3) linear computational scalability for increasing number of electrodes; and 4) generation of transparent codes that enables post-translational support for clinical decision making.

However, efforts have focused on developing computational models capable of emotion classification instead of on studying the neural substrates involved in the emotional process. In this context, we have carried out a study of cortical asymmetries and functional cortical connectivity based on the electroencephalographic signal of 24 subjects stimulated with videos of positive and negative emotional content to bring some light to the neurobiology behind emotional processes. Our results show opposite interhemispheric asymmetry patterns throughout the cortex for both emotional categories and specific connectivity patterns regarding each of the studied emotional categories. However, in general, the same key areas, such as the right hemisphere and more anterior cortical regions, presented higher levels of activity during the processing of both valence emotional categories. These results suggest a common neural pathway for processing positive and negative emotions, but with different activation patterns. These preliminary results are encouraging for elucidating the neuronal circuits of the emotional valence dimension.

MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES TOWARD A ROBUST AND RELIABLE P300 BCI SYSTEM	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-APPLICATIONS BASIS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Brain-Computer Interface (BCI); P300 Signal; Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA); Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA); Support Vector Machine (SVM); Linear Regression (LREG); Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA); Twin Support Vector Machine (TSVM)	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; SINGLE TRIAL EEG; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; WHEELCHAIR; ENSEMBLE; SVMS	A brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used for people with severe physical disabilities such as ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. BCI can allow these individuals to communicate again by creating a new communication channel directly from the brain to an output device. BCI technology can allow paralyzed people to share their intent with others, and thereby demonstrate that direct communication from the brain to the external world is possible and that it might serve useful functions. BCI systems include machine learning algorithms (MLAs). Their performance depends on the feature extraction and classification techniques employed. In this paper, we propose a system to exploit the P300 signal in the brain, a positive detection in event-related potentials. The P300 signal can be incorporated into a spelling device. There are two benefits behind this kind of research. First of all, this work presents the research status and the advantages of communication via a BCI system, especially the P300 BCI system for disordered people, and the related literature review is presented. Secondly, the paper discusses the performance of different machine learning algorithms. Two-different datasets are presented: the first dataset 2004 and the second dataset 2019. A preprocessing step is introduced to the subjects in both datasets first to extract the important features before applying the proposed machine learning methods: linear discriminant analysis (LDA I and LDA II), support vector machine (SVM I, SVM II, SVM III, and SVM IV), linear regression (LREG), Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA), and twin support vector machine (TSVM). By comparing the performance of the different machine learning systems, in the first dataset it is found that BLDA and SVMIV classifiers yield the highest performance for both subjects "A" and "B". BLDA yields 98% and 66% for 15th and 5th sequences, respectively, whereas SVMIV yields 98% and 54.4% for 15th and 5th sequences, respectively. While in the second dataset, it is obvious that BLDA classifier yields the highest performance for both subjects "1" and "2", it achieves 90.115%. The paper summarizes the P300 BCI system for the two introduced datasets. It discusses the proposed system, compares the classification methods performances, and considers some aspects for the future work to be handled. The results show high accuracy and less computational time which makes the system more applicable for online applications.

However, although PSG is a gold standard method for assessing sleep, it is obtrusive and difficult to apply for long-term sleep monitoring. Further, because human experts manually classify sleep stages, it is time-consuming and exhibits inter-rater variability. Therefore, this article proposes a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for automatic sleep stage scoring using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film sensor that can provide unconstrained long-term physiological monitoring. Signals were recorded using a PVDF sensor during PSG. From 60 recordings, 30 were used for training, 10 for validation, and 20 for testing. Sixteen parameters, including movement, respiration-related, and heart rate variability, were extracted from the recorded signals and then normalized. From the selected LSTM architecture, four sleep stage classification performances were evaluated for a test dataset and the results were compared with those of conventional machine learning methods. According to epoch-by-epoch (30 s) analysis, the classification performance for the four sleep stages had an average accuracy of 73.9% and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.55. When compared with other machine learning methods, the proposed method achieved the highest classification performance. The use of LSTM networks with the PVDF film sensor has potential for facilitating automatic sleep scoring, and it can be applied for long-term sleep monitoring at home.

J	De Venuto, D; Mezzina, G				De Venuto, Daniela; Mezzina, Giovanni			High-Specificity Digital Architecture for Real-Time Recognition of Loss of Balance Inducing Fall	SENSORS			English	Article						near falls; loss of balance; pre-impact fall detection; activities of daily life; bio-signals; EEG; EMG	PARKINSONS-DISEASE	Falls are a significant cause of loss of independence, disability and reduced quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Intervening quickly and accurately on the postural instability could strongly reduce the consequences of falls. In this context, the paper proposes and validates a novel architecture for the reliable recognition of losses of balance situations. The proposed system addresses some challenges related to the daily life applicability of near-fall recognition systems: the high specificity and system robustness against the Activities of Daily Life (ADL). In this respect, the proposed algorithm has been tested on five different tasks: walking steps, sudden curves, chair transfers via the timed up and go (TUG) test, balance-challenging obstacle avoidance and slip-induced loss of balance. The system analyzes data from wireless acquisition devices that capture electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals. The collected data are sent to two main units: the muscular unit and the cortical one. The first realizes a binary ON/OFF pattern from muscular activity (10 EMGs) and triggers the cortical unit. This latter unit evaluates the rate of variation in the EEG power spectrum density (PSD), considering five bands of interest. The neuromuscular features are then sent to a logical network for the final classification, which distinguishes among falls and ADL. In this preliminary study, we tested the proposed model on 9 healthy subjects (aged 26.3 +/- 2.4 years), even if the study on PD patients is under investigation. Experimental validation on healthy subjects showed that the system reacts in 370.62 +/- 60.85 ms with a sensitivity of 93.33 +/- 5.16%. During the ADL tests the system showed a specificity of 98.91 +/- 0.44% in steady walking steps recognition, 99.61 +/- 0.66% in sudden curves detection, 98.95 +/- 1.27% in contractions related to TUG tests and 98.42 +/- 0.90% in the obstacle avoidance protocol.

J	Bi, AQ; Ying, WH; Zhao, L				Bi, Anqi; Ying, Wenhao; Zhao, Lu			Fast Enhanced Exemplar-Based Clustering for Incomplete EEG Signals	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							AFFINITY PROPAGATION; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION	The diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy is a significant direction for both machine learning and brain science. This paper newly proposes a fast enhanced exemplar-based clustering (FEEC) method for incomplete EEG signal. The algorithm first compresses the potential exemplar list and reduces the pairwise similarity matrix. By processing the most complete data in the first stage, FEEC then extends the few incomplete data into the exemplar list. A new compressed similarity matrix will be constructed and the scale of this matrix is greatly reduced. Finally, FEEC optimizes the new target function by the enhanced alpha-expansion move method. On the other hand, due to the pairwise relationship, FEEC also improves the generalization of this algorithm. In contrast to other exemplar-based models, the performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is comprehensively verified by the experiments on two datasets.

Hence, applying it in classification as well as itself alone has become an increasingly important research field in the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Most of the existing literatures only focus on binary-class classification situations in a fixed time segment. However, the modern BCI systems usually have to deal with more motor imagery classes. In this paper, we propose two Parzen window based methods to select the discriminative feature subset and subject-specific time segment. Further, we extend the proposed methods to multi-class issues. Finally, a soft Naive Bayesian classifier is designed to solve not only binary-class but also multi-class motor imagery problems. The proposed methods are validated on two well-known datasets, BCI competition IV dataset 2a and 2b. Experimental results reveal that the proposed methods achieve an improvement of 4.38 % for 2a and 2.54 % for 2b in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Meanwhile, both proposed methods achieve an improvement of 0.04 for 2a and 0.05 for 2b in kappa coefficient, respectively. Besides, the proposed multi-class methods would potentially contribute to the online BCI systems in practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Currently, the training of BCIs is mainly focused on motor imagery. There is no report of the training combined motor imagery and speech imagery. Method: On the basis of offline experiments, an online BCI training system is designed with motor imagery and speech imagery. The filtering range is analyzed from the offline experimental data. Two most suitable channels are selected by Fisher criterion function for each subject. Power spectral density and sample entropy are combined as the algorithms of feature extraction. The extracted feature vectors are classified by extreme learning machine. As the training progresses, the feature vectors of the updated data are re-extracted and the classifier is retrained, which ensure the adaptability of the system. Results: According to the training results of twelve subjects, the results of six training sessions are gradually improved. The last session yields the best result (83 %). In the sixth session, the results of eight subjects exceed 80 %, and two results achieve and exceed 90 %. Conclusion: With the help of online training, the BCI systems can be better operated by subjects. The classification results of EEG signals are also improved. Therefore, the online training is an effective step for the BCI system based on motor imagery and speech imagery.

This disease involves complicated physiological patterns and it is still not clear what are the physio-/bio-makers that can be used as an indicator to predict SUDEP so that care providers can intervene and treat patients in a timely manner. For this sake, UTHealth School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI) organized a machine learning Hackathon to call for advanced solutions https://sbmi.uth.edu/hackathon/archive/sept19.htm.MethodsIn recent years, deep learning has become state of the art for many domains with large amounts data. Although healthcare has accumulated a lot of data, they are often not abundant enough for subpopulation studies where deep learning could be beneficial. Taking these limitations into account, we present a framework to apply deep learning to the detection of the onset of slow activity after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, as well as other EEG signal detection problems exhibiting data paucity.ResultsWe conducted ten training runs for our full method and seven model variants, statistically demonstrating the impact of each technique used in our framework with a high degree of confidence.ConclusionsOur findings point toward deep learning being a viable method for detection of the onset of slow activity provided approperiate regularization is performed.
