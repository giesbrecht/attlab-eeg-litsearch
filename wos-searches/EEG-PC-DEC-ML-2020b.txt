In recent years, time-frequency analysis method and convolutional neural network (CNN) have been combined to extract more complex features and exhibit superiors performance in comparison with conventional methods. In this paper, we presented a new classification method based on Stockwell Transform of common spatial pattern and CNN. The proposed framework with two different activation functions (ReLU and ELU) was compared with CSP-SVM and CSP-CNN methods by validation on BCI competition IV dataset I calibration data to assess the performance of the proposed method. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 81.22% (ReLU) and 81.34% (ELU), which outperformed the conventional CSP-SVM (76.45%) and CSP-CNN methods (69.29%). Further interrogation showed that the higher accuracy was attributed to improved performance in the subjects with lower detection rate by CSP-SVM. In sum, our results showed that the proposed framework can be applied to MI-BCI systems with superior performance, leading new insights towards more practical MI-based BCI applications.

Several studies defined the EEG with uniqueness features, universality, and natural robustness that can be used as a new track to prevent spoofing attacks. The EEG signals are the graphical recording of the brain electrical activities which can be measured by placing electrodes (channels) in various positions of the scalp. With a large number of channels, some channels have very important information for biometric system while others not. The channel selection problem has been recently formulated as an optimisation problem and solved by optimisation techniques. This paper proposes hybrid optimisation techniques based on binary flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and beta-hill climbing (called FPA beta-hc) for selecting the most relative EEG channels (i.e., features) that come up with efficient accuracy rate of personal identification. Each EEG signals with three different groups of EEG channels have been utilized (i.e., time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain). The FPA beta-hc is measured using a standard EEG signal dataset, namely, EEG motor movement/imagery dataset with a real world data taken from 109 persons each with 14 different cognitive tasks using 64 channels. To evaluate the performance of the FPA beta-hc, five measurement criteria are considered:accuracy (Acc), (ii) sensitivity (Sen), (iii) F-score (F_s), (v) specificity (Spe), and (iv) number of channels selected (No. Ch). The proposed method is able to identify the personals with high Acc, Sen., F_s, Spe, and less number of channels selected. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that FPA beta-hc is able to reduce the number of channels with accuracy rate up to 96% using time-frequency domain features. For comparative evaluation, the proposed method is able to achieve results better than those produced by binary-FPA-OPF method using the same EEG motor movement/imagery datasets. In a nutshell, the proposed method can be very beneficial for effective use of EEG signals in biometric applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, MA; Han, JF; Duan, LJ				Li, Ming-Ai; Han, Jian-Fu; Duan, Li-Juan			A Novel MI-EEG Imaging With the Location Information of Electrodes	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; convolutional neural network; interpolation method; machine learning; MI-EEG imaging method	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; MOTOR IMAGERY	Combination of the Motor Imagery EEG (MI-EEG) imaging and Deep Convolutional Neural Network is a prospective recognition method in brain computer interface. Nowadays, the frequency or time-frequency analysis has been applied to each channel of MI-EEG signal to obtain a spatio-frequency or time-frequency image, and even the images from several channels are infused to generate a combined image. However, the real position information of channels or electrodes is lost in these MI-EEG images, and this is contradictory to the activation area of MI-tasks. In this paper, the MI period and the frequency band covered by mu and beta rhythms are divided into ten time windows and three sub-bands, respectively. Then, for each electrode, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is employed to transform each time window to spectrum, and its inverse FFT is calculated for each sub-band. The time-domain powers of ten time windows are averaged for the same sub-band. So, three average powers are generated as the time-frequency features of each electrode of MI-EEG. They are further arranged to the electrode coordinate figure by using Clough-Tocher interpolation algorithm, and a complicated image, in which the time-frequency features are correctly located at the real position of each electrode, is obtained to embody the MI-EEG in detail. Furthermore, a VGG network is modified to perform effective recognition for MI-EEG image, and it is called mVGG. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, and the 10-folds cross validation accuracies of 88.62%, 92.28% and 96.86% are achieved respectively, and they are higher than that of the state-of-the-art imaging methods. Kappa values and ROC curves demonstrate our method has lower class skew and error costs. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of proposed MI-EEG imaging method, and it is well-matched with mVGG.

The Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been widely used for seizure detection due to its effectiveness in classification tasks, although at the cost of a protracted training time. While Kriging exploits the spatial correlation between data locations, DNN relies on its capacity to learn intrinsic representations within the dataset from the basest unit parts. This paper presents a Distributed Kriging-Bootstrapped Deep Neural Network (DNN) model as a twofold solution for fast and accurate seizure detection using brain signals collected with the electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy subjects and patients of epilepsy. The proposed model parallelizes the Kriging computation into different cores in a machine and then produces a strongly correlated, unified quasi-output data which serves as an input to the Deep Neural Network. Experimental results validate the proposed model as superior to conventional Kriging methods and DNN by training in 91% less time than the basic DNN and about three times as fast as the ordinary Kriging-Bootstrapped Deep Neural Network (DNN) model while maintaining good performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and testing accuracy compared to other models and existing works.

In this work, we build models to distinguish the normal hearing (NH) or mild hearing impairment (HI) using the different genres of machine learning. We compute band wise power spectral density (PSD) of source-derived EEGs as features in building models using support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and AdaBoost classifiers and compare their performance while listeners perceived clear or noise-degraded sounds. Combining all frequency bands features obtained from the whole-brain, the SVM registered the best performance. The group classification accuracy was found to be 94.90% [area under the curve (AUC) 94.75%; F1-score 95.00%] perceived the clear speech, and for noise-degraded speech perception, accuracy was found to be 92.52% (AUC 91.12%, and F1-score 93.00%). Remarkably, individual frequency band analysis on whole-brain data showed that gamma frequency band segregated groups with a best accuracy of 96.78%, AUC 96.79% for clear speech data and noise-degraded speech data yielded slightly less accuracy of 93.62% with AUC 93.17% by using SVM. A separate analysis using the left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) data showed that the LH activity is a better predictor of groups compared to RH. These results are consistent with the dominance of LH in auditory-linguistic processing. Our results demonstrate that spectral features of the gamma -band frequency could be used to differentiate NH and HI older adults in terms of their ability to process speech sounds. These findings would be useful to model attentional and listening assistive devices to amplify a more specific pitch than others.

Most recently, researches have proved that connectivity features were able to characterize different MI tasks. In this study, we investigated the performance of functional connectivity features measured by phase lag index (PLI), weighted phase lag index(wPLI) and phase-locking value(PLV) on MI classification. The widely-used filter-bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) approach was employed here for performance assessment. A linear support vector machine was trained to classify different MI tasks using two publicly-available datasets from BCI Competition III and IV. The classification results showed that connectivity features achieved classification accuracy >85% in most cases and PLI outperformed all other methods including FBCSP. Our work suggested that functional connectivity features could be utilized as a powerful tool for recognizing different motor intention.

Detecting emotions by monitoring the physical signals with wearable smart devices offers new promises for care support. While there are multiple studies on wearable devices, few of these pertain to soft electroencephalogram (EEG) caps designed for long-time wear by elderly people. In this study, a 4-channel textile cap was designed with dry electrodes held by an ultra-soft gel holder, while fashion and ergonomic design features were introduced to enhance wearability and comfort. The dry-electrode textile cap performed highly for monitoring EEG signals; closely matching the wet electrodes equipment. All participants reported positive feedback stating that the textile cap was softer, lighter, and more comfortable than other devices. A cumulative contribution rate of 72.199% for two factors (materials properties factor and design pattern factor) was achieved using the principal factor method (PFA), which are influencing the usability of the wearable devices. An average emotion classification accuracy of 81.32% was obtained from 5 healthy elderly subjects. It was thus concluded that the proposed method provides a stable monitoring and comfortable user experience for users, and can be used to detect emotions for elderly people with good results in the future.

With the limited time and complex operation procedures, human stress is a leading risk. Especially shutdown maintenance workers often need to go through excessive and stressful on-site trainings to digest complex operation information in limited time. The challenge is that workers' stress status and task performance are hard to predict, as most trainings are only assessed after the shutdown maintenance operation is finished. A proactive assessment or intervention is needed to evaluate workers' stress status and task performance during the training to enable early warning and interventions. This study proposes a neurophysiological approach to assess workers' stress status and task performance under different virtual training scenarios. A Virtual Reality (VR) system integrated with the eye-tracking function was developed to simulate the power plant shutdown maintenance operations of replacing a heat exchanger in both normal and stressful scenarios. Meanwhile, a portable neuroimaging device - Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was also utilized to collect user's brain activities by measuring hemodynamic responses associated with neuron behavior. A human-subject experiment (n = 16) was conducted to evaluate participants' neural activity patterns and physiological metrics (gaze movement) related to their stress status and final task performance. Each participant was required to review the operational instructions for a pipe maintenance task for a short period and then perform the task based on their memory in both normal and stressful scenarios. Our experiment results indicated that stressful training had a strong impact on participants' neural connectivity patterns and final performance, suggesting the use of stressors during training to be an important and useful control factors. We further found significant correlations between gaze movement patterns in review phase and final task performance, and between the neural features and final task performance. In summary, we proposed a variety of supervised machine learning classification models that use the fNIRS data in the review session to estimate individual's task performance. The classification models were validated with the k-fold (k = 10) cross-validation method. The Random Forest classification model achieved the best average classification accuracy (80.38%) in classifying participants' task performance compared to other classification models. The contribution of our study is to help establish the knowledge and methodological basis for an early warning and estimating system of the final task performance based on the neurophysiological measures during the training for industrial operations.

A translucent visual stimulus panel (TVSP) is set up in front of the wheelchair to provide an intuitive P300 visual stimulus operation as well as to realize the see-through scene during operating wheelchairs. In this research, a micro projector is utilized to produce flickering visual stimuli on the display board which is 35cm away from the user. To improve the information transfer rate (ITR), a spatial filter based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were also applied to this work to improve the performance of BCI classification. The result of experiments showed that the proposed BCI is with 88.2% in accuracy and 22.97 bits/min information transfer rate in average received from ten subjects. In ground truth experiments of practical trajectory tracking, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of P300 BCI are 12.11cm in "U" trajectory test.

As machine learning models become more sophisticated, and biometric data becomes more readily available through new noninvasive technologies, it becomes increasingly possible to gain access to interesting biometric data that could revolutionize Human-Computer Interaction. In this research, we propose a method to assess and quantify human attention levels and their effects on learning. In our study, we employ a brain computer interface (BCI) capable of detecting brain wave activity and displaying the corresponding electroencephalograms (EEG). We train recurrent neural networks (RNNS) to identify the type of activity an individual is performing.

This makes it difficult to visualize the cortical lateralization of event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) during left and right foot motor imageries. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of using ERD/ERS in the mu, low beta, and high beta bandwidth, during left and right foot dorsiflexion kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI), as unilateral control commands for a brain-computer interface (BCI). EEG was recorded from nine healthy participants during cue-based left-right foot dorsiflexion KMI tasks. The features were analysed for common average and bipolar references. With each reference, mu and beta band-power features were analysed using time-frequency (TF) maps, scalp topographies, and average time course for ERD/ERS. The cortical lateralization of ERD/ERS, during left and right foot KMI, was confirmed. Statistically significant features were classified using LDA, SVM, and KNN model, and evaluated using the area under ROC curves. An increase in high beta power following the end of KMI for both tasks was recorded, from right and left hemispheres, respectively, at the vertex. The single trial analysis and classification models resulted in high discrimination accuracies, i.e. maximum 83.4% for beta ERS, 79.1% for beta ERD, and 74.0% for mu ERD. With each model the features performed above the statistical chance level of 2-class discrimination for a BCI. Our findings indicate these features can evoke left-right differences in single EEG trials. This suggests that any BCI employing unilateral foot KMI can attain classification accuracy suitable for practical implementation. Given results stipulate the novel utilization of mu and beta as independent control features for discrimination of bilateral foot KMI in a BCI.

A multi-scale cortical wiring space links cellular architecture and functional dynamics in the human brain	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MATTER CONNECTIVITY; MYELIN CONTENT; DIFFUSION MRI; DEFAULT-MODE; CONNECTOME; NETWORKS; ECHOES; FMRI	The vast net of fibres within and underneath the cortex is optimised to support the convergence of different levels of brain organisation. Here, we propose a novel coordinate system of the human cortex based on an advanced model of its connectivity. Our approach is inspired by seminal, but so far largely neglected models of cortico-cortical wiring established by postmortem anatomical studies and capitalises on cutting-edge in vivo neuroimaging and machine learning. The new model expands the currently prevailing diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography approach by incorporation of additional features of cortical microstructure and cortico-cortical proximity. Studying several datasets and different parcellation schemes, we could show that our coordinate system robustly recapitulates established sensory-limbic and anterior-posterior dimensions of brain organisation. A series of validation experiments showed that the new wiring space reflects cortical microcircuit features (including pyramidal neuron depth and glial expression) and allowed for competitive simulations of functional connectivity and dynamics based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and human intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) coherence. Our results advance our understanding of how cell-specific neurobiological gradients produce a hierarchical cortical wiring scheme that is concordant with increasing functional sophistication of human brain organisation. Our evaluations demonstrate the cortical wiring space bridges across scales of neural organisation and can be easily translated to single individuals.

J	Netzer, E; Geva, AB				Netzer, Eitan; Geva, Amir B.			Human-in-the-loop active learning via brain computer interface	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Deep learning; Human-In-The-Loop; Transfer Learning; Clustering; Brain Computer Interface; EEG; Active Learning	P300; REPRESENTATIONS; COMPONENT	This paper develops and examines an innovative methodology for training an artificial neural network to identify and tag target visual objects in a given database. While the field of Artificial Intelligence in general, and computer vision in particular, has greatly advanced in recent years, fast and efficient methods for tagging (i.e., labeling) visual targets are still lacking. Tagging data is important to train, as it allow to train supervised learning models. However, this is a tiresome task that often creates bottlenecks in academic and industrial research projects. In order to develop an algorithm that improves data tagging processes, this study utilizes the advantages of human cognition and machine learning by combining Brain Computer Interface, Human-In-The-Loop, and Deep Learning. Combining these three fields into one algorithm could enable the rapid annotation of large visual databases that have no prior references and cannot be described as a mathematical optimization function. Human-In-The-Loop is an increasingly researched area that refers to the integration of human feedback in computation processes. At present, computer-based deep learning can only be incorporated in the process of identifying and tagging target objects of interest if a predefined database exists - one that has already been defined by a human user. To reduce the scope of this timely and costly process, our algorithm uses machine learning techniques (i.e., active learning) to minimize the number of target objects a human user needs to identify before the computer can successfully carry out the task independently. In our method, users are connected to electroencephalograms electrodes and shown images using rapid serial visual presentation - a fast method for presenting users with images. Some images are target objects, while others are not. Based on users' brainwave activity when target objects are shown, the computer learns to identify and tag target objects - already in the learning stage (unlike naive uniform sampling methods that first require human input, and only then begin the learning stage). As such, our work is proof of concept for the effectiveness of involving humans in the computer's learning stage, i.e., human-in-the-loop as opposed to the traditional method of humans first tagging the data and the machines then learning and creating a model.

We consider the cross-subject decoding problem from local field potential (LFP) signals, where training data collected from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a source subject is used to decode intended motor actions in a destination subject. Approach. We propose a novel supervised transfer learning technique, referred to as data centering, which is used to adapt the feature space of the source to the feature space of the destination. The key ingredients of data centering are the transfer functions used to model the deterministic component of the relationship between the source and destination feature spaces. We propose an efficient data-driven estimation approach for linear transfer functions that uses the first and second order moments of the class-conditional distributions. Main results. We apply our data centering technique with linear transfer functions for cross-subject decoding of eye movement intentions in an experiment where two macaque monkeys perform memory-guided visual saccades to one of eight target locations. The results show peak cross-subject decoding performance of 80%, which marks a substantial improvement over random choice decoder. In addition to this, data centering also outperforms standard sampling-based methods in setups with imbalanced training data. Significance. The analyses presented herein demonstrate that the proposed data centering is a viable novel technique for reliable LFP-based cross-subject brain- computer interfacing and neural prostheses.

In this paper, to decode pigeon behavior outcomes in goal-directed decision task, an experiment based on plus maze was designed and the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) of the pigeon was selected as the target brain region. The local field potential (LFP) signals in the waiting area (WA) and turning area (TA) were recorded when the pigeons performed the goal-directed tasks. Then, the brain functional connection networks of the LFPs were constructed and the extracted features were applied to decode pigeon behavior outcomes. Firstly, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to carried out time-frequency analysis and the task-related frequency band (40-60 Hz) was extracted. Then, weighted sparse representation (WSR) method was used to construct the functional connectivity network and the related network features were selected. Finally, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm was used to decode behavior outcomes. The results show that the energy difference between TA and WA in 40-60 Hz band is significantly higher than those in other bands. The selected features have good discriminability for the representation of the differences between WA and TA.

J	Kikumoto, A; Mayr, U				Kikumoto, Atsushi; Mayr, Ulrich			Conjunctive representations that integrate stimuli, responses, and rules are critical for action selection	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						conjunctive representations; rule-based action; EEG decoding	MIXED SELECTIVITY; TASK; INFORMATION; FILES	People can use abstract rules to flexibly configure and select actions for specific situations, yet how exactly rules shape actions toward specific sensory and/or motor requirements remains unclear. Both research from animal models and human-level theories of action control point to the role of highly integrated, conjunctive representations, sometimes referred to as event files. These representations are thought to combine rules with other, goalrelevant sensory and motor features in a nonlinear manner and represent a necessary condition for action selection. However, so far, no methods exist to track such representations in humans during action selection with adequate temporal resolution. Here, we applied time-resolved representational similarity analysis to the spectral-temporal profiles of electroencephalography signals while participants performed a cued, rule-based action selection task. In two experiments, we found that conjunctive representations were active throughout the entire selection period and were functionally dissociable from the representation of constituent features. Specifically, the strength of conjunctions was a highly robust predictor of trial-by-trial variability in response times and was selectively related to an important behavioral indicator of conjunctive representations, the so-called partial-overlap priming pattern. These results provide direct evidence for conjunctive representations as critical precursors of action selection in humans.

J	Zheng, LJ; Mountstephens, J; Teo, J				Zheng, Lim Jia; Mountstephens, James; Teo, Jason			Four-class emotion classification in virtual reality using pupillometry	JOURNAL OF BIG DATA			English	Article						Emotion classification; Eye-tracking; Pupil diameter; Virtual reality; Machine learning		BackgroundEmotion classification remains a challenging problem in affective computing. The large majority of emotion classification studies rely on electroencephalography (EEG) and/or electrocardiography (ECG) signals and only classifies the emotions into two or three classes. Moreover, the stimuli used in most emotion classification studies utilize either music or visual stimuli that are presented through conventional displays such as computer display screens or television screens. This study reports on a novel approach to recognizing emotions using pupillometry alone in the form of pupil diameter data to classify emotions into four distinct classes according to Russell's Circumplex Model of Emotions, utilizing emotional stimuli that are presented in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The stimuli used in this experiment are 360 degrees videos presented using a VR headset. Using an eye-tracker, pupil diameter is acquired as the sole classification feature. Three classifiers were used for the emotion classification which are Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF).FindingsSVM achieved the best performance for the four-class intra-subject classification task at an average of 57.05% accuracy, which is more than twice the accuracy of a random classifier. Although the accuracy can still be significantly improved, this study reports on the first systematic study on the use of eye-tracking data alone without any other supplementary sensor modalities to perform human emotion classification and demonstrates that even with a single feature of pupil diameter alone, emotions could be classified into four distinct classes to a certain level of accuracy. Moreover, the best performance for recognizing a particular class was 70.83%, which was achieved by the KNN classifier for Quadrant 3 emotions.ConclusionThis study presents the first systematic investigation on the use of pupillometry as the sole feature to classify emotions into four distinct classes using VR stimuli. The ability to conduct emotion classification using pupil data alone represents a promising new approach to affective computing as new applications could be developed using readily-available webcams on laptops and other mobile devices that are equipped with cameras without the need for specialized and costly equipment such as EEG and/or ECG as the sensor modality.

In this paper, an entropy-based information-theoretic approach is introduced for the automated categorization of sleep stages using multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This approach comprises of three stages. First, the decomposition of multi-channel EEG signals into sub-band signals or modes is performed using a novel multivariate projection-based fixed boundary empirical wavelet transform (MPFBEWT) filter bank. Second, entropy features such as bubble and dispersion entropies are computed from the modes of multi-channel EEG signals. Third, a hybrid learning classifier based on class-specific residuals using sparse representation and distances from nearest neighbors is used to categorize sleep stages automatically using entropy-based features computed from MPFBEWT domain modes of multi-channel EEG signals. The proposed approach is evaluated using the multi-channel EEG signals obtained from the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) sleep database. Our results reveal that the proposed sleep staging approach has obtained accuracies of 91.77%, 88.14%, 80.13%, and 73.88% for the automated categorization of wake vs. sleep, wake vs. rapid eye movement (REM) vs. Non-REM, wake vs. light sleep vs. deep sleep vs. REM sleep, and wake vs. S1-sleep vs. S2-sleep vs. S3-sleep vs. REM sleep schemes, respectively. The developed method has obtained the highest overall accuracy compared to the state-of-art approaches and is ready to be tested with more subjects before clinical application.

They may be classified as either passive or active. In this latter kind of BCI, changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in response to an external stimulus are used to decode a command or an order to an external device. New method: This project aims at developing a stable and active BCI based on steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) by intermittent photic stimulation using different LEDs with high stimulation frequencies to improve visual comfort. Spatial filters, calculated automatically during a training phase, are used in pre-processing to enhance the EEG signals and their desired features. Hence, we present an approach to automatically calculate the optimum spatial filters to detect the SSVEP at each stimulation frequency used. Results: Experiments with 10 subjects allowed determining which detection method, based on either the instantaneous power or the magnitude-squared coherence, is more suitable for decoding the commands the BCI has to give out. Comparison with existing methods: Differently to other methods, this one chooses automatically the best spatial filter during the training phase and uses multiple stimulation frequencies with high frequencies to avoid annoyance and preventing risks related to photo-epilepsy. Conclusions: A stable and active BCI was designed with a correct detection rate within 74-76%, ITR value between 19 and 26 [bit/min] and response delay for the detection between two consecutive stimulation frequencies within 2-2.5 s.

Detection of anomalous high-frequency events in human intracranial EEG	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						automated detection algorithm; epilepsy surgery; High-frequency oscillations; machine learning; seizure onset zone	OSCILLATIONS 80-500 HZ; SEIZURE-ONSET ZONE; AUTOMATIC DETECTION; EPILEPSY; ALGORITHM; TIME; MACROELECTRODES; CLASSIFICATION; RESECTION; RIPPLES	ObjectiveHigh-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. However, no physiological definition of an HFO has been established, so detection relies on the empirical definition of an HFO derived from visual observation. This can bias estimates of HFO features such as amplitude and duration, thereby hindering their utility as biomarkers. Therefore, we set out to develop an algorithm that detects high-frequency events in the intracranial EEG that are morphologically distinct from background without requiring assumptions about event amplitude or shape. MethodWe propose the anomaly detection algorithm (ADA), which uses unsupervised machine learning to identify segments of data that are distinct from the background. We apply ADA and a standard HFO detector using a root mean square amplitude threshold to intracranial EEG from 11 patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery. The rate, amplitude, and duration of the detected events and the percent overlap between the two detectors are compared. ResultIn the seizure onset zone (SOZ), ADA detected a subset of conventional HFOs. In non-SOZ channels, ADA detected at least twice as many events as the standard approach, including some conventional HFOs; however, ADA also identified many low and intermediate amplitude events missed by the standard amplitude-based method. The rate of ADA events was similar across all channels; however, the amplitude of ADA events was significantly higher in SOZ channels (P < .0045), and the amplitude measurement was more stable over time than the HFO rate, as indicated by a lower coefficient of variation (P < .0125). SignificanceADA does not require human supervision, parameter optimization, or prior assumptions about event shape, amplitude, or duration. Our results suggest that the algorithm's estimate of event amplitude may differentiate SOZ and non-SOZ channels. Further studies will examine the utility of HFO amplitude as a biomarker for epilepsy surgical outcome.

Thus, traditional brain-computer interface (BCI) systems require a calibration process in which the subject & x2019;s data are extracted in order to train machine-learning classifiers. Despite past efforts to eliminate this process, often referred to as & x201C;zero-training,& x201D; BCI systems & x2019; best performance is achievable only with some level of calibration. This tedious process is one of the factors that have limited the use of BCI systems in the real world. Meanwhile, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been proven to be useful in distinguishing neurophysiological features. In this study, we investigated whether an existing convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with large ERP samples (n & x003D; 99,000) can achieve zero-training in a P300 BCI speller system. As a result, the zero-trained CNN achieved comparable performance (89 & x0025;, p & x003C; 0.05) when compared to traditional approaches (94 & x0025;) in an offline study. We also demonstrate that the constructed CNN works successfully in an online experiment in which twelve BCI subjects achieved 85 & x0025; mean accuracy without calibration, compared to 82 & x0025; (but the difference was not significant, p & x003E; 0.05) with calibration. Additionally, we illustrate a hybrid approach in order to further enhance performance, which adaptively updates a linear classifier using label information generated from a zero-trained CNN. With this technique, the hybrid approach achieved reasonable performance (92 & x0025;), showing no statistical difference (p & x003E; 0.05) when compared to the traditional approach in the same offline data.

Furthermore, evidence from category learning has shown that dissociable memory systems are engaged, depending on the structure of a task. This can even hold true for tasks that are very similar to each other, which complicates the process of classifying brain activity as relating to changes that are associated with learning or reflecting the engagement of a memory system suited for the task. The primary goals of these studies were to characterize the mechanisms that are associated with category learning and understand the extent to which different memory systems are recruited within a single task. Two studies providing spatial and temporal distinctions between learning-related changes in the brain and category-dependent memory systems are presented. The results from these experiments support the notion that exemplar memorization, rule-based, and perceptual similarity-based categorization are flexibly recruited in order to optimize performance during a single task. We conclude that these three methods, along with the memory systems they rely on, aid in the development of expertise, but their engagement might depend on the level of familiarity with a category.

To overcome this limitation, the acoustoelectric effect (AE) based acoustoelectric brain imaging (ABI) is proposed for mapping brain electrical activity in a high temporal and spatial resolution. Through phantom and vivo rat brain experiments, this study investigated a biological current source coding mechanism with pulse focused ultrasound (PFU) at pulse repetition frequency (PRF). First, the current source coding mechanism is deduced in theory. Then, with phantom experiment, the coding relationship between AE signal and PRF is investigated in details. With different PRFs, including 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 500 Hz and 1 kHz, amplitude spectrum analysis results indicate that obvious high amplitude response of AE signal appear at each PRF and corresponding harmonic frequencies. And for different current sources of 10 Hz and 30 Hz, the AE signal oscillate at the the same frequency as corresponding PRF. Additionally, for each PRF, the decoded AE signal is of the same frequency and phase with the current source. Finally, coding mechanism is further validated in vivo rat experiment with different PRFs, including 500 Hz, 1 kHz and 2 kHz. The AE signal envelope and decoded AE signal both have significant correlation with low frequency EEG with ultrasound not only in the low frequency band but also in specific frequency. Also, the mean amplitude of delta rhythm respectively calculated from envelope of AE signal and decoded AE signal are obviously higher than the other rhythms which reflects the brain state of anesthesia or lethargy. These theory and experiment results validate that PFU has a coding effect on current source at PRF and demonstrate the feasibility of restoring current source from the coded AE signal which are critical for making ABI a clinical neuroimaging technique.

The EEG signal consists of different frequency bands, which correspond to the different emotional and mental activities of the humans. Most of the research work uses the whole frequency spectrum for the detection of seizures. In this paper, first time the proposed automated system utilizing machine learning technique using only alpha band (8-12 Hz). This paper uses Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) due to its high speed and less complexity in hardware implementation to convert EEG data in time-frequency (t-f) plane. As brain oscillations of a person vary in different health conditions, four statistical features have been extracted from t-f plane of alpha band. The detection performance of the features of alpha band has been analyzed on six classifiers using tenfold cross-validation which shows that the Random Forest (RF) classifier gives the best performance among different classifiers for most of the experiments performed. This study has achieved the best classification accuracy of 98% and ROC analysis revealed maximum Area Under Curve (AUC) of 1 to distinguish the seizures and healthy. Hence, the statistical features of the alpha band depict to be a potential biomarker for the real time detection system.

However, across subjects emotional recognition has become an insurmountable gap which researchers cannot step across for a long time due to the poor generalizability of features across subjects. In response to this difficulty, in this study, the moving average(MA) technology is introduced to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. Based on the MA technology, an effective method for cross-subject emotion recognition was then developed, which designed a method of salient region extraction based on attention mechanism, with the purpose of enhancing the capability of representations generated by a network by modelling the interdependencies between the channels of its informative features. The effectiveness of our method was validated on a dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP) and the MAHNOB-HCT multi modal tagging database. Compared with recent similar works, the method developed in this study for emotion recognition across all subjects was found to be effective, and its accuracy was 66.23% fir valence and 68.50% for arousal (DEAP) and 70.25% for valence and 73.27% for arousal (MAHNOB) on the Gamma frequency band. And benefiting from the strong representational learning capacity in the two-dimensional space, our method is efficient in emotion recognition especially on Beta and Gamma waves.

However, inconsistent MI-BCI performance occurs in variations of brain signals across subjects and experiments; this is considered to be a significant problem in practical BCI. Moreover, some subjects exhibit a phenomenon referred to as "BCI-inefficiency," in which they are unable to generate brain signals for BCI control. These subjects have significant difficulties in using BCI. The primary goal of this study is to identify the connections of the resting-state network that affect MI performance and predict MI performance using these connections. We used a public database of MI, which includes the results of psychological questionnaires and pre-experimental resting-state taken over two sessions on different days. A dynamic causal model was used to calculate the coupling strengths between brain regions with directionality. Specifically, we investigated the motor network in resting-state, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which performs motor planning. As a result, we observed a significant difference in the connectivity strength from the supplementary motor area to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the low- and high-MI performance groups. This coupling, measured in the resting-state, is significantly stronger in the high-MI performance group than the low-MI performance group. The connection strength is positively correlated with MI-BCI performance (Session 1:r= 0.54; Session 2:r= 0.42). We also predicted MI performance using linear regression based on this connection (r-squared= 0.31). The proposed predictors, based on dynamic causal modeling, can develop new strategies for improving BCI performance. These findings can further our understanding of BCI-inefficiency and help BCI users to lower costs and save time.

In the past researchers extracted different features extracting strategies to detect the arrhythmia. Since, signals acquired from subjects suffered with arrhythmia are multivariate, highly nonlinear, nonstationary, time variant and very complex. Traditional features extraction approaches could not capture full dynamics to detect these signals. In this study, we extracted hybrid features based on refined sample entropy (SampEn) and Fuzzy entropy (FuzEn) computed on mean, standard deviation and variance in combination with traditional features. The machine learning support vector machines with its kernels, decision tree, KNN and ensemble methods were employed to detect the arrhythmia. The 10-fold cross-validation was used for training/validation of data. The Support Vector Machine and its kernels, Fine KNN, and Ensemble Boosted Tree give the highest performance with an overall accuracy of 100%, AUC of 1.00. An accuracy of 95.5% and 100% was obtained using SVM coarse Gaussian, 97% and 100% using Fine KNN, 95.5% and 97% using Decision tree with traditional and hybrid features respectively. The results revealed that SVM coarse Gaussian, Coarse KNN, Decision tree methods outer performed using hybrid features than the traditional feature extracting strategy.

Performing motor imagery tasks causes proper formation of special patterns at a specific timeframe of the EEG signal. The accurate selection of this optimal informative timeframe has not yet been investigated. Previous studies have considered an identic portion of data for all individuals, while neglecting that the duration and delay takes for the motor imagery brain activities to be well reflected in EEG signals vary between individuals. We propose an intelligent hybrid genetic algorithm-support vector machine (SVM) method to select the most stimulated timeframe of interest. The method also selects the most distinctive subset of features (through a comprehensive fused set of temporal, spectral and wavelet inspected information) while simultaneously optimize the SVM classifier's parameters. Evaluation results show that not only the most stimulated timeframe has a short duration but also occurs after a specific delay: that they are different between individuals. Using this optimal timeframe, the classification accuracy increased up to 92.14% for Graz 2003 and 89.00%, 84.81% and 85.00% for O3, S4 and X11 subjects of Graz 2005 database respectively. These results that were obtained despite the use of a small set of features confirm that this intelligent method can be effective in increasing the computational speed while decreasing the computational complexity which provides the potential capability of including in real time BCI systems.

Cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) play an indispensable role in the analysis of sleep quality and related disorders like nocturnal front lobe epilepsy, insomnia, narcolepsy etc. The traditional manual segregation methods of CAP phases by the medical experts are prone to human fatigue and errors which may lead to inaccurate diagnosis of sleep stages. In this paper, we present an automated approach for the classification of CAP phases (A and B) using Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and Renyi entropy (RE) features. The WVD provides a high-resolution time-frequency analysis of the signals whereas RE provides least time-frequency uncertainty with WVD. The classification is performed using medium Gaussian kernel-based support vector machine with 10-fold cross-validation technique. We have presented the results for randomly sampled balanced data sets. The proposed approach does not require any pre-processing or post-processing stages, making it simple as compared to the existing techniques. The proposed method is able to achieve an average classification accuracy of 72.35% and 87.45% for balanced and unbalanced data sets respectively. The proposed method can aid the medical experts to analyze the cerebral stability as well as the sleep quality of a person.

Some college students have also been in a state of anxiety and panic for a long time, and mental health diseases have shown an explosive growth trend. The development of social networks such as Weibo, QQ, and WeChat not only provides more convenient communication methods for college students, but also provides a new emotional vent window for college students. They can record their living conditions in real time through social networks and interact with friends to express emotions and relieve stress. At the same time, the development of social networks has also provided a new way for the detection of depressed users. The current computer technology analyzes the user's social network data to detect the user's depression. This study uses text-level mining of Sina Weibo data from college students to detect depression among college students. First, collect text information of college student users in Sina Weibo, and construct the text information into input data that can be used for machine learning. Deep neural networks are used for feature extraction. An deep integrated support vector machine(DISVM) algorithm is introduced to classify the input data, and finally realize the recognition of depression. DISVM makes the recognition model more stable and improves the accuracy of depression diagnosis to a certain extent.

Therefore, in this paper we survey the latest scientific research on deep learning in physiological signal data such as electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrooculogram (EOG). We found 147 papers published between January 2018 and October 2019 inclusive from various journals and publishers. The objective of this paper is to conduct a detailed study to comprehend, categorize, and compare the key parameters of the deep-learning approaches that have been used in physiological signal analysis for various medical applications. The key parameters of deep-learning approach that we review are the input data type, deep-learning task, deep-learning model, training architecture, and dataset sources. Those are the main key parameters that affect system performance. We taxonomize the research works using deep-learning method in physiological signal analysis based on: (1) physiological signal data perspective, such as data modality and medical application; and (2) deep-learning concept perspective such as training architecture and dataset sources.

Some neuroprotection treatments are only effective for specific, short windows of time during this evolution of injury. Clinically, we often do not know when an insult may have started, and thus which phase of injury the brain may be experiencing. To improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment efficacy, we need to establish biomarkers which denote phases of injury. Our pre-clinical research, using preterm fetal sheep, show that micro-scale EEG patterns (e.g. spikes and sharp waves), superimposed on suppressed EEG background, primarily occur during the early recovery from an HI insult (0-6 h), and that numbers of events within the first 2 h are strongly predictive of neural survival. Thus, real-time automated algorithms that could reliably identify EEG patterns in this phase will help clinicians to determine the phases of injury, to help guide treatment options. We have previously developed successful automated machine learning approaches for accurate identification and quantification of HI micro-scale EEG patterns in preterm fetal sheep post-HI. This paper introduces, for the first time, a novel online fusion strategy that employs a high-level wavelet-Fourier (WF) spectral feature extraction method in conjunction with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for accurate identification of micro-scale preterm fetal sheep post-HI sharp waves in 1024Hz EEG recordings, along with 256Hz down-sampled data. The classifier was trained and tested over 4120 EEG segments within the first 2 hours latent phase recordings. The WF-CNN classifier can robustly identify sharp waves with considerable high-performance of 99.86% in 1024Hz and 99.5% in 256Hz data. The method is an alternative deep-structure approach with competitive high-accuracy compared to our computationally-intensive WS-CNN sharp wave classifier.

Several studies have reported that time estimation involves the communication and synchronization of neural assemblies that decode the duration of time. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the interaction between different brain areas during time estimation. Brain electrical activity was recorded during a time perception task and correlation matrices were calculated using different frequency bands. Graph networks show an important contribution of fronto-central regions and left hemisphere. The estimation of time could involve the recruitment of attentional resources and the inhibition of motor responses to make a temporal prediction, by this way possibly monitoring the "flow of time".

However, there is sparse research directly comparing these groups in terms of EEG activity. Method: We investigated 87 participants' left and right EEG frontal alpha-1, alpha-2, and theta activity related to happy and sad face stimuli in unipolar (UD, n=33) and bipolar (BD, n=22) depressed participants, and controls without depression (HC, n=32). Results: Post-hoc analysis of an observed hemisphere x group interaction (p<.037) showed significant differences in alpha-1 asymmetry only for the comparison of UD and HC (p<.006). Further analysis of a significant emotion x group interaction (p= .001) revealed a differential impact of stimulus valence on theta power between the groups (p<.001). The valence dependent theta power of the BD differed from that of the UD (p<.0002) and the HC (p<.004). Alpha-1 asymmetry classified HC and both depressed groups with an accuracy of .69. Valence-related theta classified BD from UD with an accuracy of .83. Leave one-out cross validation resulted in slightly reduced accuracy. Limitations: Important limitations were the small sample size and that subjects were not medication-free. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the value of simple, task related EEG activity for differentiating not only healthy individuals from those with depression, but also individuals with unipolar depression from those with bipolar depression.

Yet, no consensus exists on how crucial the latter are for the inception of semantic distinctions. To address this issue, we combined electroencephalographic (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) to examine when nouns denoting facial body parts (FBPs) and nonFBPs are discriminated in face-processing and multimodal networks. First, FBP words increased N170 amplitude (a hallmark of early facial processing). Second, they triggered fast (similar to 100 ms) activity boosts within the face-processing network, alongside later (similar to 275 ms) effects in multimodal circuits. Third, iEEG recordings from face-processing hubs allowed decoding similar to 80% of items before 200 ms, while classification based on multimodal-network activity only surpassed similar to 70% after 250 ms. Finally, EEG and iEEG connectivity between both networks proved greater in early (0-200 ms) than later (200-400 ms) windows. Collectively, our findings indicate that, at least for some lexico-semantic categories, meaning is construed through fast reenactments of modality-specific experience.

This study uses a novel brain-inspired artificial neural network to investigate the effect of mindfulness training on electroencephalographic function. Participants completed a 4-tone auditory oddball task (that included targets and physically similar distractors) at three assessment time points. In Group A (n = 10), these tasks were given immediately prior to 6-week mindfulness training, immediately after training and at a 3-week follow-up; in Group B (n = 10), these were during an intervention waitlist period (3 weeks prior to training), pre-mindfulness training and post-mindfulness training. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) model, we evaluated concurrent neural patterns generated across space and time from features of electroencephalographic data capturing the neural dynamics associated with the event-related potential (ERP). This technique capitalises on the temporal dynamics of the shifts in polarity throughout the ERP and spatially across electrodes. Findings support anteriorisation of connection weights in response to distractors relative to target stimuli. Right frontal connection weights to distractors were associated with trait mindfulness (positively) and depression (inversely). Moreover, mindfulness training was associated with an increase in connection weights to targets (bilateral frontal, left frontocentral, and temporal regions only) and distractors. SNN models were superior to other machine learning methods in the classification of brain states as a function of mindfulness training.

A prerequisite for further analysis is the identification of the sleep macroarchitecture through manual sleep staging. Several computer-based approaches have been proposed to extract time and/or frequency-domain features with accuracy ranging from 80% to 95% compared with the golden standard of manual staging. However, their acceptability by the medical community is still suboptimal. Recently, utilizing deep learning methodologies increased the research interest in computer-assisted recognition of sleep stages. Aiming to enhance the arsenal of automatic sleep staging, we propose a novel classification framework based on convolutional neural networks. These receive as input synchronizations features derived from cortical interactions within various electroencephalographic rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) for specific cortical regions which are critical for the sleep deepening. These functional connectivity metrics are then processed as multidimensional images. We also propose to augment the small portion of sleep onset (N1 stage) through the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique in order to deal with the great difference in its duration when compared with the remaining sleep stages. Our results (99.85%) indicate the flexibility of deep learning techniques to learn sleep-related neurophysiological patterns.

These events can be classified in three groups (A1, A2, and A3) according to their spectral contents, and are thought to play a role in the transitions between the different sleep stages. A-phase detection and classification is usually performed manually by a trained expert, but it is a tedious and time-consuming task. In the past two decades, various researchers have designed algorithms to automatically detect and classify the A-phases with varying degrees of success, but the problem remains open. In this paper, a different approach is proposed: instead of attempting to design a general classifier for all subjects, we propose to train ad-hoc classifiers for each subject using as little data as possible, in order to drastically reduce the amount of time required from the expert. The proposed classifiers are based on deep convolutional neural networks using the log-spectrogram of the EEG signal as input data. Results are encouraging, achieving average accuracies of 80.31% when discriminating between A-phases and non A-phases, and 71.87% when classifying among A-phase sub-types, with only 25% of the total A-phases used for training. When additional expert-validated data is considered, the sub-type classification accuracy increases to 78.92%. These results show that a semi-automatic annotation system with assistance from an expert could provide a better alternative to fully automatic classifiers.

However, sleep monitoring is not yet part of standard veterinary practice, and the possible importance of sleep-related physiological alterations for certain behavioral problems in pets is seriously understudied. Recently, a non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) method was developed for pet dogs that is well-suited for untrained individuals. This so called polysomnography protocol could easily be implemented in veterinary diagnosis. However, in order to make the procedure more effective and standardized, methodological questions about the validity and reliability of data processing need to be answered. As a first step, the present study tests the effect of several factors on the manual scoring of the different sleep stages (a standard procedure adopted from human studies). Scoring the same recordings but varying the number of EEG channels visible to the scorer (emulating the difference between single channel versus four channel recordings) resulted in significant differences in hypnograms. This finding suggests that using more recording electrodes may provide a more complete picture of dog brain electrophysiological activity. Visual sleep staging by three different expert raters also did not provide a full agreement, but despite this, there were no significant differences between raters in important output values such as sleep structure and the spectral features of the EEG. This suggests that the non-invasive canine polysomnography method is ready to be implemented for veterinary use, but there is room for further refinement of the data processing. Here, we describe which parts of the sleep recording yield the lowest agreement and present the first form of an automated method that can reliably distinguish awake from sleep stages and could thus accelerate the time-consuming manual data processing. The translation of the findings into clinical practice will open the door to the more effective diagnosis and treatment of disorders with sleep-related implications. Non-invasive polysomnography recording on dogs has been claimed to produce data comparable to those for humans regarding sleep macrostructure, EEG spectra and sleep spindles. While functional parallels have been described relating to both affective (e.g., emotion processing) and cognitive (e.g., memory consolidation) domains, methodologically relevant questions about the reliability of sleep stage scoring still need to be addressed. In Study 1, we analyzed the effects of different coders and different numbers of visible EEG channels on the visual scoring of the same polysomnography recordings. The lowest agreement was found between independent coders with different scoring experience using full (3 h-long) recordings of the whole dataset, and the highest agreement within-coder, using only a fraction of the original dataset (randomly selected 100 epochs (i.e., 100 x 20 s long segments)). The identification of drowsiness was found to be the least reliable, while that of non-REM (rapid eye movement, NREM) was the most reliable. Disagreements resulted in no or only moderate differences in macrostructural and spectral variables. Study 2 targeted the task of automated sleep EEG time series classification. Supervised machine learning (ML) models were used to help the manual annotation process by reliably predicting if the dog was sleeping or awake. Logistic regression models (LogREG), gradient boosted trees (GBT) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) were set up and trained for sleep state prediction from already collected and manually annotated EEG data. The evaluation of the individual models suggests that their combination results in the best performance: similar to 0.9 AUC test scores.

The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) time series is converted to spikes and provided as an input to NeuCube. Relevant feature vectors are extracted at different stages of training. We used six standard machine learning classifiers on different combinations of these feature vectors and calculated 5-fold cross-validation accuracy. We observed that the gradient boosted decision trees classifier performed the best by achieving 81.25% accuracy on a combination of two feature vectors. An evaluation of the results using confusion matrices and classification reports showed that the Awake, N2, SWS and REM sleep stages can be classified with >= 80% F1-score using the gradient boosted decision trees algorithm. Overall, our proof-of-concept work towards autonomous sleep-stage classification using NeuCube shows promise and will form the base for continued research in this direction.

We introduce a novel, phase-based, functional connectivity descriptor that encapsulates not only the synchronization strength between distinct brain regions, but also the time-lag between the involved neural oscillations. The new estimator employs complex-valued measurements and results in a brain network sketch that lives on the smooth manifold of Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) matrices. Approach: Leveraging the HPD property of the proposed descriptor, we adapt a recently introduced dimensionality reduction methodology that is based on Riemannian Geometry and discriminatively detects the recording sites which best reflect the differences in network organization between contrasting recording conditions in order to overcome the problem of high-dimensionality, usually encountered in the connectivity patterns derived from multisite encephalographic recordings. Main results. The proposed framework is validated using an EEG dataset that refers to the challenging problem of differentiating between attentive and passive visual responses. We provide evidence that the reduced connectivity representation facilitates high classification performance and caters for neuroscientific explorations. Significance. Our paper is the very first that introduces an advanced connectivity descriptor that can take advantage of Riemannian geometry tools. The proposed descriptor, that inherently and simultaneously captures both the strength and the corresponding time-lag of the phase synchronization, is the first phase-based descriptor tailored to leverage the benefits of Riemannian geometry.

At the same time, any patterns can be better recognized and thus new knowledge that may be embedded within the pattern can be extracted. From the experiment with the case study of Haxby fMRI data, NeuCubeB has accomplished better accuracy in recognizing the brain patterns compared with the standard machine learning techniques (i.e. SVM and MLP).

Despite its convenience, analysis of its intrinsic characteristics is limited. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of time interval and channel selection that affects the decoding performance of the multi-class visual imagery. We divided the epoch into time intervals of 0-1 s and 1-2 s and performed six-class classification in three different brain regions: whole brain, visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex. In the time interval, 0-1 s group showed 24.2 % of average classification accuracy, which was significantly higher than the 1-2 s group in the prefrontal cortex. In the three different regions, the classification accuracy of the prefrontal cortex showed significantly higher performance than the visual cortex in 0-1 s interval group, implying the cognitive arousal during the visual imagery. This finding would provide crucial information in improving the decoding performance.

However, traditional machine learning and deep learning methods focus on the single electrode feature analysis and ignore the functional connection of the brain. In addition, the recent brain function connection network method needs to manually extract substantial brain network features, which results in cumbersome operation. For this reason, this paper introduces graph convolution combined with brain function connection theory into the study of mental fatigue and proposes a method for driving fatigue detection based on the partial directed coherence graph convolutional neural network (PDC-GCNN), which can analyze the characteristics of single electrodes while automatically extracting the topological features of the brain network. We designed a fatigue driving simulation experiment and collected the EEG signals. In the present work, the PDC method constructs the adjacency matrix to describe the relationship between EEG channels, and the GCNN combines single-electrode local brain area information and brain area connection information to further improve the performance of detecting fatigue states. Based on the features of differential entropy (DE) and power spectral density (PSD), the average recognition accuracy of ten-fold cross validation is 84.32% and 83.84%, respectively. For further experiments on each subject, the average recognition results are 95.24%/5.10% (PSD) and 96.01%/3.81% (DE). This research can be embedded in the vehicle driving fatigue detection system, which has practical application value. Published under license by AIP Publishing.

Recently, deep learning has been introduced into the BCI community due to its better generalization and feature representation abilities. However, most studies currently only have validated deep learning models for single datasets, and the generalization ability for other datasets still needs to be further verified. In this paper, we validated deep learning models for eight MI datasets and demonstrated that the cross-dataset variability problem weakened the generalization ability of models. To alleviate the impact of cross-dataset variability, we proposed an online pre-alignment strategy for aligning the EEG distributions of different subjects before training and inference processes. The results of this study show that deep learning models with online pre-alignment strategies could significantly improve the generalization ability across datasets without any additional calibration data.

It is one of the most recent marketing research strategies and may become the future of marketing research. Many research works have been carried out in this area to obtain better outcomes. However, literature shows that there is an opportunity for further improvement. Hence, in this study, a model is presented using data mining and machine learning algorithms for consumer behavior analysis from EEG signals. Time-frequency distribution features are extracted from EEG signals on which different classification algorithms are applied. Consumer's responses toward marketing strategies and their behavior towards purchasing or selecting goods can he studied and analyzed to understand the producer-consumer relationship. EEG signals from 25 people are collected where the participants varied in age and gender for a better understanding of consumer behavior towards a marketing policy. By analyzing the data, the reason behind how and why they like certain marketing policies was uncovered. The performance of our proposed model with an existing technique is compared. The accuracy of our model on the dataset is 95%, whereas the accuracy of the existing technique on the same dataset is 70%. We also evaluated whether neuropsychological measures can capture differences in consumer's actions according to different marketing stimuli. The experimental results on our model indicate that studies in this field can bring a change and improve marketing strategies for the betterment of both the producer and the consumer, resulting in an eventual mutual benefit.

It is also considered the major factor causing the out-of-the-loop phenomenon (OOTL) occurrence. OOTL is strongly related to a high level of automation in operative contexts such as the Air Traffic Management (ATM), and it could lead to a negative impact on the Air Traffic Controllers' (ATCOs) engagement. As a consequence, being able to monitor the ATCOs' vigilance would be very important to prevent risky situations. In this context, the present study aimed to characterise and assess the vigilance level by using electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. The first study, involving 13 participants in laboratory settings allowed to find out the neurophysiological features mostly related to vigilance decrements. Those results were also confirmed under realistic ATM settings recruiting 10 professional ATCOs. The results demonstrated that (i) there was a significant performance decrement related to vigilance reduction; (ii) there were no substantial differences between the identified neurophysiological features in controlled and ecological settings, and the EEG-channel configuration defined in laboratory was able to discriminate and classify vigilance changes in ATCOs' vigilance with high accuracy (up to 84%); (iii) the derived two EEG-channel configuration was able to assess vigilance variations reporting only slight accuracy reduction.

A filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and mutual information-based best individual feature (MIBIF) selection were used in the study to decode MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and extract a feature matrix as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A successive eye-blink switch was sequentially combined with the EEG decoder in operating the lower-limb exoskeleton. Ten subjects demonstrated more than 80% accuracy in both offline (training) and online. All subjects successfully completed a gait task by wearing the lower-limb exoskeleton through the developed real-time BCI controller. The BCI controller achieved a time ratio of 1.45 compared with a manual smartwatch controller. The developed system can potentially be benefit people with neurological disorders who may have difficulties operating manual control.

Imaging of Nonlinear and Dynamic Functional Brain Connectivity Based on EEG Recordings With the Application on the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; dementia; visualisation; system identification; machine learning	SCALP EEG; EPILEPSY	Since age is the most significant risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to understand the effect of normal ageing on brain network characteristics before we can accurately diagnose the condition based on information derived from resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, aiming to detect brain network disruption. This article proposes a novel brain functional connectivity imaging method, particularly targeting the contribution of nonlinear dynamics of functional connectivity, on distinguishing participants with AD from healthy controls (HC). We describe a parametric method established upon a Nonlinear Finite Impulse Response model, and a revised orthogonal least squares algorithm used to estimate the linear, nonlinear and combined connectivity between any two EEG channels without fitting a full model. This approach, where linear and non-linear interactions and their spatial distribution and dynamics can be estimated independently, offered us the means to dissect the dynamic brain network disruption in AD from a new perspective and to gain some insight into the dynamic behaviour of brain networks in two age groups (above and below 70) with normal cognitive function. Although linear and stationary connectivity dominates the classification contributions, quantitative results have demonstrated that nonlinear and dynamic connectivity can significantly improve the classification accuracy, barring the group of participants below the age of 70, for resting state EEG recorded during eyes open.

Convolutional Neural Network for Seizure Detection of Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							EEG; ACCELEROMETRY; MODEL	The Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE) is a form of epilepsy in which seizures occur predominantly during sleep. In other forms of epilepsy, the commonly used clinical approach mainly involves manual inspection of encephalography (EEG) signals, a laborious and time-consuming process which often requires the contribution of more than one experienced neurologist. In the last decades, numerous approaches to automate this detection have been proposed and, more recently, machine learning has shown very promising performance. In this paper, an original Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is proposed to develop patient-specific seizure detection models for three patients affected by NFLE. The performances, in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, exceed by several percentage points those in the most recent literature. The capability of the patient-specific models has been also tested to compare the obtained seizure onset times with those provided by the neurologists, with encouraging results. Moreover, the same CNN architecture has been used to develop a cross-patient seizure detection system, resorting to the transfer-learning paradigm. Starting from a patient-specific model, few data from a new patient are enough to customize his model. This contribution aims to alleviate the task of neurologists, who may have a robust indication to corroborate their clinical conclusions.

BioCNN: A Hardware Inference Engine for EEG-Based Emotion Detection	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Emotion recognition; EEG; FPGA; machine learning; hardware accelerator; edge AI; convolutional neural networks; hardware parallelism; pipelining	NEURAL-NETWORKS; DATABASE	EEG-based emotion classifiers have the potential of significantly improving the social integration of patients suffering from neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or the acute stages of Alzheimer's disease. Emotion classifiers have historically used software on general-purpose computers and operating under off-line conditions. Yet the wearability of such classifiers is a must if they are to enable the socialization of critical-care patients. Such wearability requires the use of low-power hardware accelerators that would enable near real-time classification and extended periods of operations. In this article, we architect, design, implement, and test a handcrafted, hardware Convolutional Neural Network, named BioCNN, optimized for EEG-based emotion detection and other bio-medical applications. The EEG signals are generated using a low-cost, off-the-shelf device, namely, Emotiv Epoc C, and then denoised and pre-processed ahead of their use by BioCNN. For training and testing, BioCNN uses three repositories of emotion classification datasets, including the publicly available DEAP and DREAMER datasets, along with an original dataset collected in-house from 5 healthy subjects using standard visual stimuli. Asubject-specific training approach is used under TensorFlow to train BioCNN, which is implemented using the Digilent Atlys Board with a low-cost Spartan-6 FPGA. The experimental results show a competitive energy efficiency of 11 GOps/W, a throughput of 1:65 GOps that is in line with the real-time specification of a wearable device, and a latency of less than 1 ms, which is smaller than the 150 ms required for human interaction times. Its emotion inference accuracy is competitive with the top software-based emotion detectors.

Seizure burden fluctuates with the female reproductive cycle in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Convolutional neural network; EEG; Epilepsy; Estrous cycle; Hippocampus; Kainic acid	HORMONE-RELEASING HORMONE; KAINIC ACID MODEL; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; ESTROUS-CYCLE; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; STEROID-HORMONES; BINDING-SITES; ESTRUS CYCLE; RAT; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Women with catamenial epilepsy often experience increased seizure burden near the time of ovulation (periovulatory) or menstruation (perimenstrual). To date, a rodent model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that exhibits similar endogenous fluctuations in seizures has not been identified. Here, we investigated whether seizure burden changes with the estrous cycle in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE. Adult female IHKA mice and saline-injected controls were implanted with EEG electrodes in the ipsilateral hippocampus. At one and two months post-injection, 24/7 video-EEG recordings were collected and estrous cycle stage was assessed daily. Seizures were detected using a custom convolutional neural network machine learning process. Seizure burden was compared within each mouse between diestrus and combined proestrus and estrus days (pro/estrus) at two months post-injection. IHKA mice showed higher seizure burden on pro/ estrus compared with diestrus, characterized by increased time in seizures and longer seizure duration. When all IHKA mice were included, no group differences were observed in seizure frequency or EEG power. However, increased baseline seizure burden on diestrus was correlated with larger cycle-associated differences, and when analyses were restricted to mice that showed the severe epilepsy typical of the IHKA model, increased seizure frequency on pro/estrus was also revealed. Controls showed no differences in EEG parameters with cycle stage. These results suggest that the stages of proestrus and estrus are associated with higher seizure burden in IHKA mice. The IHKA model may thus recapitulate at least some aspects of reproductive cycle-associated seizure clustering.

However, conventional personality trait detection is often biased and unreliable, as it depends on the honesty of the subjects when filling out the lengthy questionnaires. In this paper, we propose a method for objective detection of personality traits using physiological signals. Subjects are shown affective images and videos to evoke a range of emotions. The electrical activity of the brain is captured using EEG during this process and the multi-channel EEG data is processed to compute the inter-hemispheric asynchrony of the brainwaves. The most discriminative features are selected and then used to build a machine learning classifier, which is trained to predict 16 personality traits. Our results show high predictive accuracy for both image and video stimuli individually, and an improvement when the two stimuli are combined, achieving a 95.49% accuracy. Most of the selected discriminative features were found to be extracted from the alpha frequency band. Our work shows that personality traits can be accurately detected with EEG data, suggesting possible use in practical applications for early detection of mental and cognitive disorders.

Brain computer interface (BCI) system allows humans to control external devices through motor imagery (MI) signals. However, many existing feature extraction algorithms cannot eliminate the influence of individual differences. This research proposed a new processing algorithm that can reduce the impact of individual differences on classification and improve the universality of the algorithm. Approach. To select the optimal frequency band, the energy in each sub-band was calculated by the discrete wavelet transform. Power spectral density and visual geometric group network based convolutional neural network were used for feature extraction and classification respectively. Main results. The test of the BCI Competition IV dataset IIa proved the superiority of the algorithm. In comparison with some commonly used methods, the proposed algorithm reduced classification calculation time while improving classification accuracy; the average classification accuracy rate reaches 96.21%, which is far exceeding the results obtained by the latest literature. Significance. The good classification performance of this research was rooted in the reduced number of parameters, the reduced consumption of computing resources, and the eliminated influence of individual differences. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can be applied to a real-time multi-class BCI system.

A New Wavelet-Based Neural Network for Classification of Epileptic-Related States using EEG	JOURNAL OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Wavelet-based neural networks; Epileptic seizure detection; EEG analysis; Machine learning classification; Wavelet selection	SEIZURE DETECTION; OPTIMAL SELECTION; SIGNALS; ENTROPY; MODEL; RECOGNITION; PREDICTION; FAMILIES; SYSTEM	In this paper, we present a novel neural network able to classify epileptic seizures using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, called "Multidimensional Radial Wavelons Feed-Forward Wavelet Neural Network" (MRW-FFWNN). The network is part of a classification system, which distinguishes among three brain states related to epilepsy namely ictal, interictal and healthy. Efficient methods for pre-processing EEG's, extracting features and getting the final class decisions were selected using a statistical three-fold cross-validation method, which assures the robustness of the system and its generalization ability. The following methods were systematically analyzed to find the most appropriate for this problem: 1) Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters for noise reduction; 2) discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) for frequency decomposition of the EEG signals; 3) average correlation and maximum voting correlation for selecting a suitable mother wavelet for frequency decomposition; 4) Binary-tree and one-vs-one (OVO) decomposition strategies for primary binary classification; 5) voting and weighted-voting strategy aggregation strategies for the final classification. The integrated system was assessed using a three-fold cross validation, applied to a benchmark provided by the University of Bonn, getting an average accuracy of 93.33% when tested using sets Z, S and F and 95.0% when sets Z, S, F and O were used. The proposed network got competitive accuracy, compared with other state-of-the art classifiers, training in almost a half of the time than the ones with similar accuracy.

For the recording of the signals, a 4-channel acquisition system was designed, which could be configured to work with unipolar or bipolar derivation, as required by the experiment. The selection of the best base in the multi-resolution wavelet analysis, two important parameters were taken into account, the measurement of entropy and the percentages of classification of these levels, because the evoked potentials are generally constant in their morphology, it was made coherent averaging giving as a result the space-time location where this evoked potential appears, Once the characteristics of the treated signal were obtained, they were classified using two different methods of artificial intelligence, neural networks and vector support machines. At this stage, the measurement of the standard deviation of the data was taken into account to ensure that the learning machine was trained correctly. The results obtained reliably demonstrate the general behaviour of the evoked potentials as a result of the stimuli presented. In addition, it was possible to verify the variation of the patient's alpha waves according to his or her state of relaxation or alert in each case, it is advisable to carry out a much more robust filtering system to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG signal, facilitate its analysis and improve the results.

However, an applicable technique for fatigue detection/prediction is hindered due to substantial inter-subject differences in behavioural impairment and brain activity. Here, we developed a fully crossvalidated, data-driven analysis framework incorporating multivariate regression model to explore the feasibility of utilizing functional connectivity (FC) to predict the fatigue-related behavioural impairment at individual level. EEG was recorded from 40 healthy adults as they performed a 30-min high-demanding sustained attention task. FC were constructed in different frequency bands using three widely-adoptedmethods (including coherence, phase log index (PLI), and partial directed coherence (PDC)) and contrasted between the most vigilant and fatigued states. The differences of individual FC (diff (FC)) were considered as features; whereas the TOT slop across the course of task and the differences of reaction time (Delta RT) between the most vigilant and fatigued states were chosen to represent behavioural impairments. Behaviourally, we found substantial inter-subject differences of impairments. Furthermore, we achieved significantly high accuracies for individualized prediction of behavioural impairments using diff (PDC). The identified top diff (PDC) features contributing to the individualized predictions were found mainly in theta and alpha bands. Further interrogation of diff (PDC) features revealed distinct patterns between the TOT slop and Delta RT prediction models, highlighting the complex neural mechanisms of mental fatigue. Overall, the current findings extended conventional brain-behavioural correlation analysis to individualized prediction of fatigue-related behavioural impairments, therebymoving a step forward towards development of applicable techniques for quantitative fatigue monitoring in real-world scenarios.

As further their consequences, increases in brain excitability and the development of drug-resistant epilepsy can frequently be observed in clinical cases. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena can also be examined on animal models of brain dysplasia. This study was conducted on rats with four degrees of brain dysplasia following exposure to gamma radiation on days 13, 15, 17, or 19 of prenatal development. When reached adulthood, the rats received electroencephalographic (EEG) transmitter implantation. Thereafter, pilocarpine was administered, and significant differences in susceptibility to seizures were detected depending on the degree of brain dysplasia. Before, during, and after the seizures, EEG was recorded in free moving animals. Additionally, the intensity of seizure behavioral symptoms was assessed. Strong and moderate correlations were found between the intensity of seizure behavioral symptoms, the power of particular EEG bands, and volumes of dysplastic brains and their regions. The data drew particular attention to correlations between variations in EEG spectra and changes in the midbrain and pons volumes. The results point to possible significant roles of these regions in the observed changes of susceptibility to seizures. Consequently, the frequently used experimental model was considered here not only as representing cases of cortical dysplasia but also of generalized, diffuse dysplasia of the whole brain.

Wavelet Spectral Deep-training of Convolutional Neural Networks for Accurate Identification of High-Frequency Micro-Scale Spike Transients in the Post-Hypoxic-Ischemic EEG of Preterm Sheep	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Early diagnosis and prognosis of babies with signs of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is currently limited and requires reliable prognostic biomarkers to identify at risk infants. Using our pre-clinical fetal sheep models, we have demonstrated that micro-scale patterns evolve over a profoundly suppressed EEG background within the first 6 hours of recovery, post HI insult. In particular, we have shown that high-frequency micro-scale spike transients (in the gamma frequency band, 80-120Hz) emerge immediately after an HI event, with much higher numbers around 2-2.5 h of the insult, with numbers gradually declining thereafter. We have also shown that the automatically quantified sharp waves in this phase are predictive of neural outcome. Initiation of some neuroprotective treatments within this limited window of opportunity, such as therapeutic hypothermia, optimally reduces neural injury. In clinical practice, it is hard to determine the exact timing of the injury, therefore, reliable automatic identification of EEG transients could be beneficial to help specify the phases of injury. Our team has previously developed successful machine- and deep-learning strategies for the identification of post-HI EEG patterns in an HI preterm fetal sheep model. This paper introduces, for the first time, a novel online fusion approach to train an 11-layers deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier using Wavelet-Fourier (WF) spectral features of EEG segments for accurate identification of high-frequency micro-scale spike transients in 1024Hz EEG recordings in our preterm fetal sheep. Sets of robust features were extracted using reverse biorthogonal wavelet (rbio2.8 at scale 7) and considering an 80-120Hz spectral frequency range. The WF-CNN classifier was able to accurately identify spike transients with a reliable high-performance of 99.03 +/- 0.86%.

Two different types of CP and no-pain (NP) MTT signals are obtained from 15 subjects. Four features, namely, power spectral exponential entropy, improved multiscale permutation entropy, refined composite multiscale dispersion entropy, and refined composite multiscale fuzzy entropy, are extracted in the variational modal decomposition domain. The feature datasets are divided into training datasets and test datasets in a 3:1 ratio. Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are selected as classifiers. The training datasets are imported into the classifier, and the optimal training dataset is obtained with a 10-fold cross validation strategy. The feature dimension reduction algorithm of the principal component analysis is used to reduce the complexity of the feature datasets and select the most recognizable features. The classification performance of the test datasets is evaluated by the optimal classifiers. Results showed that the RF classifier performs better than the SVM classifier. The RF classifier provides high values of specificity (91.67%), sensitivity (95.83%), positive predictive value (92.00%), accuracy (93.75%), and area under curve (0.867). The combination of the microwave detection approach and machine learning algorithm can effectively detect brain activity induced by nociceptive stimulation. This approach is important in improving the accuracy of pain detection.

Anticipatory Detection of Self-Paced Rehabilitative Movements in the Same Upper Limb From EEG Signals	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces; EEG signals; movement intention; neurorehabilitation; robot-assisted therapies; self-paced movement; upper limb	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MOTOR IMAGERY; MACHINE INTERFACES; NEUROREHABILITATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; CLASSIFICATION	Currently, one of the challenges in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for neurorehabilitation is the recognition of the intention to perform different movements from the same limb. This would allow finer control of neurorehabilitation and motor recovery devices by end-users. To address this issue, we assess the feasibility of recognizing two rehabilitative right upper-limb movements from pre-movement EEG signals. These rehabilitative movements were performed self-selected and self-initiated by the users using a motor rehabilitation robotic device. This work proposes anticipatory detection scenarios that discriminate EEG signals corresponding to non-movement state and movement intentions of two same-limb movements. The studied movements were discriminated above the empirical chance levels for all proposed detection scenarios. Percentages of correctly anticipated trials ranged from 64.3% to 77.0%, and the detection times ranged from 620 to 300 ms prior to movement initiation. The results of these studies indicate that it is possible to detect the intention to perform two different movements of the same upper limb and non-movement state. Based on these results, the decoding of the movement intention could potentially be used to develop more natural and intuitive robot-assisted neurorehabilitation therapies.

However, a direct comparison of their efficacy has not been possible due to different recording setups, tasks, species, etc. To address this, we implanted customized arrays having both microelectrodes and electrocorticogram (ECoG) electrodes in the primary visual cortex of 2 female macaque monkeys, and also recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), while they viewed a variety of naturalistic images and parametric gratings. Surprisingly, ECoG had higher information and decodability than all other signals. Combining a few ECoG electrodes allowed more accurate decoding than combining a much larger number of microelectrodes. Control analyses showed that higher decoding accuracy of ECoG compared with local field potential was not because of differences in low-level visual features captured by them but instead because of larger spatial summation of the ECoG. Information was high in the 30-80 Hz range and at lower frequencies. Information in different frequencies and scales was nonredundant. These results have strong implications for Brain Machine Interface applications and for study of population representation of visual stimuli.

Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to decode the attended speaker from the brain activity, e.g., recorded by electroencephalography sensors. While numerous of these auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms appeared in the literature, their performance is generally evaluated in a non-uniform manner. Furthermore, AAD algorithms typically introduce a trade-off between the AAD accuracy and the time needed to make an AAD decision, which hampers an objective benchmarking as it remains unclear which point in each algorithm's trade-off space is the optimal one in a context of neuro-steered gain control. To this end, we present an interpretable performance metric to evaluate AAD algorithms, based on an adaptive gain control system, steered by AAD decisions. Such a system can be modeled as a Markov chain, from which the minimal expected switch duration (MESD) can be calculated and interpreted as the expected time required to switch the operation of the hearing aid after an attention switch of the user, thereby resolving the trade-off between AAD accuracy and decision time. Furthermore, we show that the MESD calculation provides an automatic and theoretically founded procedure to optimize the number of gain levels and decision time in an AAD-based adaptive gain control system.

Until now, the most challenge of P300-based BCI is to detect P300 in a minimum of repeats, which is a balance between recognition accuracy and a number of repeats. Previous studies showed that the shallow learning model such as support vector machine (SVM), relevance vector machine (RVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) had been successfully used for P300 classification. In this study, we proposed a P300 recognition algorithm based on ensemble of SVMs. Firstly, we intercept 600 ms data after the visual stimulation. Secondly, the extracted segment electroencephalogram (EEG) was averaged by iteration to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Thirdly, these obtained signals were fed to the ensemble of SVMs for target character is recognition. Finally, an output regulation mechanism was proposed for adjusting the outputs of ensemble of SVMs. The experimental results show that the highest accuracy (80%) and the information transmission rate (17.21 bits/min) are observed in the repeat number of only five. As an application and verification, this algorithm won the third prize in the BCI Controlled Robot Contest of 2019 World Robot Conference.

Most of the applications use only motor imagery or evoked potentials. Here, a deep learning network based on a sensory motor paradigm (auditory, olfactory, movement, and motor-imagery) that employs a subject-agnostic Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) Network is developed to assess cognitive functions and identify its relationship with brain signal features, which is hypothesized to consistently indicate cognitive decline. Testing occurred with healthy subjects of age 20-40, 40-60, and >60, and mildly cognitive impaired subjects. Auditory and olfactory stimuli were presented to the subjects and the subjects imagined and conducted movement of each arm during which Electroencephalogram (EEG)/Electromyogram (EMG) signals were recorded. A deep BLSTM Neural Network is trained with Principal Component features from evoked signals and assesses their corresponding pathways. Wavelet analysis is used to decompose evoked signals and calculate the band power of component frequency bands. This deep learning system performs better than conventional deep neural networks in detecting MCI. Most features studied peaked at the age range 40-60 and were lower for the MCI group than for any other group tested. Detection accuracy of left-hand motor imagery signals best indicated cognitive aging (p = 0.0012); here, the mean classification accuracy per age group declined from 91.93% to 81.64%, and is 69.53% for MCI subjects. Motor-imagery-evoked band power, particularly in gamma bands, best indicated (p = 0.007) cognitive aging. Although the classification accuracy of the potentials effectively distinguished cognitive aging from MCI (p < 0.05), followed by gamma-band power.

These variations are complex and depend on stimulus and cognitive state in ways that have yet to be fully characterized. Specifically, the frequencies (or combinations of frequencies) that most robustly encode specific types of visual information are not fully known. To address this knowledge gap, we used intracranial EEG to record LFPs at 858 widely distributed recording sites as human subjects (six males, five females) indicated whether briefly presented natural scenes depicted one of three attended object categories. Principal component analysis applied to power spectra of the LFPs near stimulus onset revealed a broadband component (1-100 Hz) and two narrowband components (1-8 and 8 -30 Hz, respectively) that encoded information about both seen and attended categories. Interestingly, we found that seen and attended categories were not encoded with the same fidelity by these distinct spectral components. Model-based tuning and decoding analyses revealed that power variations along the broadband component were most sharply tuned and offered more accurate decoding for seen than for attended categories. Power along the narrowband delta-theta (1-8 Hz) component robustly decoded information about both seen and attended categories, while the alpha- beta (8 -30 Hz) component was specialized for attention. We conclude that, when viewing natural scenes, information about the seen category is encoded via broadband and sub-gamma (<30 Hz) power variations, while the attended category is most robustly encoded in the sub-gamma range. More generally, these results suggest that power variation along different spectral components can encode qualitatively different kinds of visual information.

Numerous efforts have been taken to improve its quality by eliminating the artifacts. The EEG involves the biological artifacts (ocular artifacts, ECG and EMG artifacts), and technical artifacts (noise from the electric power source, amplitude artifacts, etc.). From these physiological artifacts, ocular activities are one of the most well-known over other noise sources. Reducing the risks of this event and avoid it is practically very difficult, even impossible, as the ocular activities are involuntary tasks. To trim down the effect of ocular artifacts overlapping with EEG signal and overwhelm the subjected flaws, few intelligent approaches have to be developed. This proposal tempts to implement a novel method for detecting and preventing ocular artifacts from the EEG signal. The developed model involves two main phases: (a) Detection of Ocular artifacts and (b) Removal of ocular artifacts. For detecting the ocular artifacts, initially, the EEG is subjected to decomposition process using 5-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Empirical Mean Curve Decomposition (EMCD). Next to the decomposition process, the features like kurtosis, variance, Shannon's entropy, and few first-order statistical features are extracted. These features will be helpful for the detection process in the classification side. For detecting the ocular artifacts from the decomposed signal, the extracted features are subjected to a machine learning algorithm called Neural Network (NN). As an improvement to the conventional NN, the training algorithm of ANN is improved by the improved Earth Worm optimization Algorithm (EWA) termed as Dual Positioned Elitism-based EWA (DPE-EWA), which updates the weight of NN to improve the performance. In the Removal phase, the optimized Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT) is deployed, in which the improvement is made on optimizing the filter coefficients using the proposed DPE-EWA. Thus, the integration of optimized NN and optimized LWT suggests a potential possibility to accommodate the detection and removal of ocular artifacts that exist in the EEG signals.

J	Ko, LW; Komarov, O; Lai, WK; Liang, WG; Jung, TP				Ko, Li-Wei; Komarov, Oleksii; Lai, Wei-Kai; Liang, Wei-Gang; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			Eyeblink recognition improves fatigue prediction from single-channel forehead EEG in a realistic sustained attention task	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain computer interface; single-channel EEG; dry electrodes; machine learning; fatigue; attention; driving	DRIVER; SLEEPINESS; DROWSINESS; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX; SIGNALS; SYSTEM	Objective. A passive brain-computer interface recognizes its operator's cognitive state without an explicitly performed control task. This technique is commonly used in conjunction with consumer-grade EEG devices for detecting the conditions of fatigue, attention, emotional arousal, or motion sickness. While it is easy to mount the sensors in the forehead area, which is not covered with hair, the recorded signals become greatly contaminated with eyeblink and movement artifacts, which makes it a challenge to acquire the data of suitable for analysis quality, particularly in few channel systems where a lack of spatial information limits the applicability of sophisticated signal cleaning algorithms. In this article, we demonstrate that by combining the features associated with electrocortical activities and eyeblink recognition analysis, it becomes feasible to design an accurate system for the inattention state prediction using just a single EEG sensor. Approach. Fifteen healthy 22-28 years old participants took part in the experiment that implemented a realistic sustained attention task of nighttime highway driving in a virtual environment. The EEG data were collected using a portable wireless Mindo-4 device, which constitutes an adjustable elastic strip with foam-based sensors, a data-acquisition module, an amplification and digitizing unit, and a Bluetooth (R) module. Main results. The spectral analysis of the EEG samples that immediately preceded the lane departure events revealed alterations in the tonic power spectral density, which accompanied elongations in the drivers' reaction times. The RMSE of the predicted reaction times, which are based on a combination of the brain-related and eyeblink features, is 0.034 +/- 0.019 s, and the r(2) is 0.885 +/- 0.057 according to a within-session leave-one-trial-out cross-validation. Significance. The drowsiness prediction from a frontal single-channel setup can achieve a comparable performance with using an array of occipital EEG sensors. As a direct result of utilizing a dry sensor placed in the non-covered with hair head area, the proposed approach in this study is low-cost and user-friendly.

Collecting substantial labeled samples in the training trials is the key to the generalization on the test trials. This process is time-consuming and laborious. In recent years, several studies have proposed various semi-supervised learning (e.g., active learning) and transfer learning (e.g., domain adaptation, style transfer mapping) methods to alleviate the requirement on training data. However, most of them are iterative methods, which need considerable training time and are unfeasible in practice. To tackle this problem, we present the Fast Online Instance Transfer (FOIT) for improved affective Brain-computer Interface (aBCI). FOIT selects auxiliary data from historical sessions and (or) other subjects heuristically, which are then combined with the training data for supervised training. The predictions on the test trials are made by an ensemble classifier. As a one-shot algorithm, FOIT avoids the time-consuming iterations. Experimental results show that FOIT brings significant improvement in accuracy for the three-category classification (1%-8%) on the SEED dataset and four-category classification (1%-14%) on the SEED-IV dataset in the cross-subject, cross-session and cross-all scenarios. The time cost over the baselines is moderate (similar to 35s on average for our machine). In contrast, to achieve comparative accuracies, the iterative methods require much more time (similar to 45s-similar to 900s). FOIT provides a simple, fast and practically feasible solution to improve the generalization of aBCIs and allows various choices of classifiers without constraints. Our codes are available online.

METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed 27 consecutive cases of patients with drug-resistant orbitofrontal epilepsy (OFE) who underwent tailored resective surgery after a detailed presurgical workup. Demographic features, seizure semiology, imaging characteristics, resection site, pathological results, and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Patients were categorized according to semiology. The underlying neural network was further explored through quantita-tive FDG-PET and ictal stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) analysis at the group level. FDG-PET studies between the semiology group and the control group were compared using a voxel-based independent t-test. Ictal SEEG was quantified by calculating the energy ratio (ER) of high-and low-frequency bands. An ER comparison between the ante- rior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the amygdala was performed to differentiate seizure spreading patterns in groups with different semiology. RESULTS Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and MRI were inconclusive to a large extent. Patients were catego-rized into the following 3 semiology groups: the frontal group (n = 14), which included patients with hyperactive au-tomatisms with agitated movements; the temporal group (n = 11), which included patients with oroalimentary or manual automatisms; and the other group (n = 2), which included patients with none of the abovementioned or indistinguishable manifestations. Patients in the frontal and temporal groups (n = 23) or in the frontal group only (n = 14) demonstrated significant hypometabolism mainly across the ipsilateral OFC, ACC, and anterior insula (AI), while patients in the tem- poral group (n = 9) had hypometabolism only in the OFC and AI. The ER results (n = 15) suggested distinct propagation pathways that allowed us to differentiate between the frontal and temporal groups. Pathologies included focal cortical dysplasia, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, cavernous malformation, glial scar, and nonspecific findings. At a minimum follow-up of 12 months, 19 patients (70.4%) were seizure free, and Engel class II, III, and IV outcomes were observed in 4 patients (14.8%), 3 patients (11.1%), and 1 patient (3.7%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of OFE requires careful presurgical evaluation. Based on their electrophysiological and metabolic evidence, the authors propose that varied semiological patterns could be explained by the extent of involve-ment of a network that includes at least the OFC, ACC, AI, and temporal lobe. Tailored resections for OFE may lead to a good overall outcome.

Bispectral analysis is applied to HRV to extract a total of 11 features out of which only 6 significantly different feature values are used to classify the subjects into three trimesters during pregnancy and postpartum. In particular, bispectrum patterns indicate the presence of higher phase coupling during postpartum as compared to the pregnancy group. The decreased phase coupling is observed as pregnancy progresses that refer to the decreased nonlinear interactions during pregnancy. This infers that the pregnancy is characterized by decreased HRV due to a reduced vagal tone instead of increased sympathetic tone. The six selected features are used as input to the k-nearest neighbour (KNN), Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifiers for data classification. The performance of the classifiers are measured based on the accuracy of classification. The classification rate obtained for KNN, GMM and PNN classifiers are 85.94%, 85.94% and 89.74% respectively. We conclude that the bispectral features with PNN classifier is better suitable for the classification of the three trimesters during pregnancy and postpartum.	[Veerabhadrappa, S.

Learners' on-task effort has been acknowledged for strongly relating to their educational outcomes, reflecting how actively they are engaged in that activity. However, effort is not directly observable. Multimodal data can provide additional insights into the learning processes and may allow for effort estimation. This paper presents an approach for the classification of effort in an adaptive assessment context. Specifically, the behaviour of 32 students was captured during an adaptive self-assessment activity, using logs and physiological data (i.e., eye-tracking, EEG, wristband and facial expressions). We applied k-means to the multimodal data to cluster students' behavioural patterns. Next, we predicted students' effort to complete the upcoming task, based on the discovered behavioural patterns using a combination of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the Viterbi algorithm. We also compared the results with other state-of-the-art classification algorithms (SVM, Random Forest). Our findings provide evidence that HMMs can encode the relationship between effort and behaviour (captured by the multimodal data) in a more efficient way than the other methods. Foremost, a practical implication of the approach is that the derived HMMs also pinpoint the moments to provide preventive/prescriptive feedback to the learners in real-time, by building-upon the relationship between behavioural patterns and the effort the learners are putting in.

Auditory Processing of Speech and Tones in Children With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Tuberous Sclerosis Complex; autism spectrum disorder; auditory evoked potential; MVPA; mismatch negativity	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY MMN; MOUSE MODEL; AUTISM; MYELINATION; DYNAMICS; INFANTS; TSC1	Individuals with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) have atypical white matter integrity and neural connectivity in the brain, including language pathways. To explore functional activity associated with auditory and language processing in individuals with TSC, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine basic auditory correlates of detection (P1, N2, N4) and discrimination (mismatch negativity, MMN) of speech and non-speech stimuli for children with TSC and age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children. Children with TSC (TSC group) and without TSC (typically developing, TD group) participated in an auditory MMN paradigm containing two blocks of vowels (/a/and/u/) and two blocks of tones (800 Hz and 400 Hz). Continuous EEG data were collected. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to explore functional specificity of neural auditory processing. Speech-specific P1, N2, and N4 waveform components of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) were compared, and the mismatch response was calculated for both speech and tones. MVPA showed that the TD group, but not the TSC group, demonstrated above-chance pairwise decoding between speech and tones. The AEP component analysis suggested that while the TD group had an increased P1 amplitude in response to vowels compared to tones, the TSC group did not show this enhanced response to vowels. Additionally, the TD group had a greater N2 amplitude in response to vowels, but not tones, compared to the TSC group. The TSC group also demonstrated a longer N4 latency to vowels compared to tones, which was not seen in the TD group. No group differences were observed in the MMN response. In this study we identified features of the auditory response to speech sounds, but not acoustically matched tones, which differentiate children with TSC from TD children.

To reduce such accidents, early detection of drowsy driving is needed. In previous studies, it was shown that driver drowsiness affected driving performance, behavioral indices, and physiological indices. The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of classification of the alert states of drivers, particularly the slightly drowsy state, based on hybrid sensing of vehicle-based, behavioral, and physiological indicators with consideration for the implementation of these identifications into a detection system. First, we measured the drowsiness level, driving performance, physiological signals (from electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram results), and behavioral indices of a driver using a driving simulator and driver monitoring system. Next, driver alert and drowsy states were identified by machine learning algorithms, and a dataset was constructed from the extracted indices over a period of 10 s. Finally, ensemble algorithms were used for classification. The results showed that the ensemble algorithm can obtain 82.4% classification accuracy using hybrid methods to identify the alert and slightly drowsy states, and 95.4% accuracy classifying the alert and moderately drowsy states. Additionally, the results show that the random forest algorithm can obtain 78.7% accuracy when classifying the alert vs. slightly drowsy states if physiological indicators are excluded and can obtain 89.8% accuracy when classifying the alert vs. moderately drowsy states. These results represent the feasibility of highly accurate early detection of driver drowsiness and the feasibility of implementing a driver drowsiness detection system based on hybrid sensing using non-contact sensors.

With the rapid development of machine learning technology, the automatic staging methods of sleep gradually replace the traditional manual interpretation which can improve the efficiency on sleep staging for medical research. LSTM networks can save the historical information as a reference for the current moment, which is undoubtedly a good way to improve sleep staging performance. In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed to extract the features from a single-channel EEG. The Uni-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Uni-LSTM) network and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network are combined with CNN to realize automatic sleep staging. The obtained results showed that the two presented network frameworks are effective and feasible on sleep staging. The Bi-LSTM which has more enriched sequence information got better classification performance than the Uni-LSTM.

EEG techniques have shown to be advantageous for studying and predicting epileptic seizures, thanks to their cost-effectiveness, non-invasiveness, portability and the capability for long-term monitoring. Linear and non-linear EEG analysis methods have been developed for the effective prediction of seizure onset, however both methods remain blind to underlying alterations of the structural and functional brain networks associated with epileptic seizures. Such information is employed in this study to develop novel method for epileptic seizure prediction. New Methods: In this study, nonlinear partial directed coherence (NPDC) was employed as measure of functional brain networks (FBNs) and analyzed to reveal the directional flow of epilepsy-linked brain activity. A novel prediction strategy was then developed for the prediction of epileptic seizures by introducing extracted network features to an extreme learning machine (ELM). Results: Results show that the proposed method achieved favorable performance across all subjects and in all EEG frequency bands, with best accuracy of 89.2% in beta band and an optimal prediction time of 1356.4 s in delta bands, which outperforms currently available approaches. Comparison with Existing Methods: Our NPDC based on FBNs methods approach surpasses the accuracy of pure graph theory and pure non-linear methods with a significantly increased prediction time. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that the proposed prediction strategy is suitable for the prediction of seizure onset.

Besides, falls are also a major safety threat to bikers, skiers, construction workers, and others. Fortunately, with the advancements of technologies, the number of proposed fall detection systems and devices has increased dramatically and some of them are already in the market. Fall detection devices/systems can be categorized based on their architectures as wearable devices, ambient systems, image processing-based systems, and hybrid systems, which employ a combination of two or more of these methodologies. In this review paper, a comparison is made among these major fall detection systems, devices, and algorithms in terms of their proposed approaches and measure of performance. Issues with the current systems such as lack of portability and reliability are presented as well. Development trends such as the use of smartphones, machine learning, and EEG are recognized. Challenges with privacy issues, limited real fall data, and ergonomic design deficiency are also discussed.

This work proposes SOUL: Stochastic-gradient-descent-based Online Unsupervised Logistic regression classifier, which provides continuous unsupervised online model updates that was initially trained with labels offline. SOUL was tested on two datasets, the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset, and a long (>250 hours) human ECoG dataset from the University of Melbourne. SOUL achieves an average cumulative sensitivity of 97.5% and 97.9% for the two datasets respectively, while maintaining <1.2 false alarms per day. When compared with state-of-the-art, a moderate sensitivity improvement of 1-3% is observed on the majority of subjects and a large sensitivity improvement of >12% is observed on three subjects with <1% impact on specificity.

SWRs, playing a crucial role in memory consolidation, are oscillatory patterns in the mammalian brain hippocampus seen on an EEG during immobility and sleep. An SWR is composed of large-amplitude sharp waves accompanied by fast field potential oscillations known as ripple rhythms. However, most of the current commercial software for brain wave processing does not provide with an accurate SWR extraction function. Also, so far there are few literatures that fully explore the ripple detection method. Taking a fuller look at the characteristics of ripple events, an improved pipeline is presented to extract SWRs. The utility of detection based on the large-amplitude feature of SWRs will be weakened by another feature, fast oscillation. Therefore, to shield the extraction from that undesired influence, Hilbert transformation is suggested to restore the analytical signal in complex number field and then to obtain the envelope of the original EEG. Next, Gaussian window is adopted to get rid of some artifacts. Then, the central and the start and end segment of an SWR are successively determined with a sliding window. In addition, considering that the determination of the duration of a ripple also changes the frequency content of a detected, truncated ripple by the spectral leakage effect, which makes it hard to find the actual frequency of the rhythm, we add Hanning window to prevent that effect. From three sets of multi-channel in vivo recording EEG data obtained from different genotypes of mice, we detected SWR events with the proposed method, whose effectiveness and accuracy were validated.

Entropy can capture the dynamic characteristics of neural signals and might be used as a quantitative evaluation parameter. However, there are some problems remain solved yet, such as the entropy model computing with a fixed scale, and whether the entropy model could evaluate the cognitive performance.These problems will affect the accuracy of detection. Therefore, the multi-scale entropy model combined with a machine learning method is proposed here to investigate the relationship between complexity derived from BOLD signal and cognitive score of healthy elderly people, so as to some new imaging biomarkers could be illuminate by rfMRI. A total of 98 healthy old volunteers were selected and divided into two groups according to the pre-scan scores for the cognitive questions test (regarded as cognitive performance here): excellent group and poor group. Firstly, the multi-scale entropy model was constructed, the entropy of scanning data was calculated in two groups, and the parameters of the model were optimized by statistics and comparison with the help machine learning method. Secondly, the eigenvectors were constructed by the entropy values of the indicative brain areas with high statistical significance under the optimized parameters of multi-scale model. Finally, the sample data were divided into either training set or testing set, in which 78 people were randomly included in the training set and the rest of 20 people were included in the testing set. The two groups of data were classified and tested by the extreme learning machine. It was found that there was a significant difference between the frontal and temporal regions in the assessment of cognitive scores of the elderly by the multi-scale entropy model based on rfMRI, and the sorting rate for the cognitive scores could reach up to 80%. Conclusion: the optimized multi-scale entropy model can effectively distinguish the cognitive scores of healthy elderly people at the frontal lobe, temporal lobe and other marker brain regions. This study has highlighted the optimization advantage of the multi-scale entropy model with the help of machine learning, and might provide a new detection parameter and a potential method for rfMRI to replace the subjective and tedious traditional cognitive scale form tests.

In this proposed design, an automatic seizure detection algorithm based on the Linear binary Support Vector Machine learning algorithm (LSVM) is developed and implemented in a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The experimental results showed that the mean detection accuracy is 86% and sensitivity is 97%. The resource utilization of the implemented design is less when compared to existing hardware implementations. The power consumption of the proposed design is 76mW at 100MHz.

Indiscriminate use of the REEG may lower its clinical yield. The pretest clinical variables contributing to the yield of the REEG outcome have not been well-established in the context of developing healthcare systems where REEG utilization may differ from well-established centers. The aim of this study is to determine the yield of the REEG and the pretest clinical variables predicting the yield of the REEG at a single center in the context of the developing healthcare system in Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods: We reviewed REEG reports at a single center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia between 2015 and 2018. We collected demographic and clinical data from the patients' electronic files. Patients of age >= 18-year-old were included. We collected age, gender, nationality, the indication for the REEG, co-morbidities, antiseizure medicines (ASMs), and details related to the yield of the REEG (normal or abnormal, epileptiform or non-epileptiform, focality, and the presence of rhythmic or periodic patterns or seizures). Results: We included 500 records. Fifty-nine percent were females. The mean age was 39 +/- 17 years. Of the recorded REEGs, 42.4% were abnormal, 14.6% of them showing definite epileptiform discharges and 85.4% showing only slowing. Half of the REEGs of individuals previously diagnosed with epilepsy revealed abnormal findings. ASM use was associated with slowing in the REEG (p < .05). Using logistic regression, history of a previous stroke and use of carbamazepine or lamotrigine were predictors of the presence of abnormalities in the REEG, while use of >= 2 ASMs predicted the presence of epileptiform discharges. Stroke also predicted abnormal slowing alongside increased age. Conclusion: The clinical yield of the REEG in this sample of patients from a single institution in the context of a developing healthcare system was relatively low. History of stroke and being on more than one ASM may predict that the REEG will show relevant abnormalities.

J	Liu, S; Wang, W; Sheng, Y; Zhang, LD; Xu, MP; Ming, D				Liu, Shuang; Wang, Wei; Sheng, Yue; Zhang, Ludan; Xu, Minpeng; Ming, Dong			Improving the Cross-Subject Performance of the ERP-Based Brain-Computer Interface Using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation and Correlation Analysis Rank	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electroencephalography; rapid serial visual presentation; event-related potential; cross-subject	FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; EEG; MODELS; P300	The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that is designed to provide communication channels to anyone through a computer. Initially, it was suggested to help the disabled, but actually had been proposed a wider range of applications. However, the cross-subject recognition in BCI systems is difficult to break apart from the individual specific characteristics, unsteady characteristics, and environmental specific characteristics, which also makes it difficult to develop highly reliable and highly stable BCI systems. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is one of the most recent spellers with a clean, unified background and a single stimulus, which may evoke event-related potential (ERP) patterns with less individual difference. In order to build a BCI system that allows new users to use it directly without calibration or with less calibration time, RSVP was employed as evoked paradigm, then correlation analysis rank (CAR) algorithm was proposed to improve the cross-individual classification and simultaneously use as less training data as possible. Fifty-eight subjects took part in the experiments. The flash stimulation time is 200 ms, and the off time is 100 ms. The P300 component was locked to the target representation by time. The results showed that RSVP could evoke more similar ERP patterns among subjects compared with matrix paradigm. Then, the included angle cosine was calculated and counted for averaged ERP waveform between each two subjects. The average matching number of all subjects was 6 for the matrix paradigm, while for the RSVP paradigm, the average matching number range was 20 when the threshold value was set to 0.5, more than three times as much larger, quantificationally indicating that ERP waveforms evoked by the RSVP paradigm produced smaller individual differences, and it is more favorable for cross-subject classification. Information transfer rates (ITR) were also calculated for RSVP and matrix paradigms, and the RSVP paradigm got the average ITR of 43.18 bits/min, which was 13% higher than the matrix paradigm. Then, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value was computed and compared using the proposed CAR algorithm and traditional random selection. The results showed that the proposed CAR got significantly better performance than the traditional random selection and got the best AUC value of 0.8, while the traditional random selection only achieved 0.65. These encouraging results suggest that with proper evoked paradigm and classification methods, it is feasible to get stable performance across subjects for ERP-based BCI. Thus, our findings provide a new approach to improve BCI performances.

Visual scoring of all-night recordings has inter-scorer variability which may lead to subjective results. Hence, we aimed to develop a novel automated method to detect arousals from two electroencephalographic channels in terms of the synchronic events of the right and left hemispheres. Methods: In the context of the occurrence of arousal pattern, the relationship between two synchronic C3-A2 and C4-A1 channels were quantified using by coherence spectrum and mutual information. The power and the ratio values of the sub-bands of the coherence spectrum were selected as the five features. Furthermore, the mutual information value was determined as the sixth feature. The automatic detection performance was evaluated using six features and machine learning techniques, on five different patients' whole-night electroencephalography recordings. The presented method does not include any signal conditioning, pre-processing steps, any manual involvement, meta-rule-based approaches, and some empirical thresholds. Results: The significant increases were found in sub-bands of the coherence spectrum in case of arousal. Moreover, the mutual information of these channels was distinctive during the arousal state. Consequently, the overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV values were achieved as 99.5 %, 99.8 %, 99.6 %, and 99.3 %, respectively with using ensemble bagged tree. Conclusion: The novelty of the present study is the practical determination of the relationship between electroencephalographic synchronization and the occurrence of the arousals between the central regions of the right and left hemispheres.

Hence it has gained momentum in seizure detection research, as in many other fields. However, its high performance is at the expense of an extensive training time. This is not appropriate for a real-time application such as seizure detection in which a swift reaction is required to save the life of the patient. This paper presents a novel Kriging-Bootstrapped Deep Neural Network hierarchical model for early seizure detection in which Kriging is first used to generate a well-correlated intermediate data set from the original input. The correlated data is then fed into the DNN for the final training Experiments were carried out using electroencephalogram (EEG) data from both normal and epileptic patients. Results show that, with the same architecture and data size, the cumulative training time of the Krigging-Bootstrapped DNN is about 75% lower than that of the ordinary DNN without a compromise in performance as the proposed hybrid model shows a slightly better accuracy than the baseline DNN model.

Methods Forty-seven children of school- age, fulfilling the SPCE (Surveillance of Cerebral palsy in Europe)-criteria of hemiplegic cerebral palsy, identified via the Swedish cerebral palsy register, were invited and asked to participate in the study. Results Fifteen boys and six girls participated. Of the sixteen children born at term, five had no risk factors for cerebral palsy. Two out of five preterm children presented additional risk factors. Debut of motor impairment was observed in the first year of life in sixteen children. Age at diagnosis varied from 2 months to 6 years. Epilepsy was common and associated with grey- and white matter injury. Conclusions Recognizing the importance of risk factors for cerebral palsy, any child with these risk factors should be offered a check-up by a paediatrician or a paediatric neurologist. Thereby reducing diagnostic delay. Epilepsy is common in hemiplegic cerebral palsy and associated with grey- and white matter injury in this cohort.

It has a powerful ability to automatically extract features and is widely used in classification tasks with scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the small number of samples and low signal-to-noise ratio involved in scalp EEG with low spatial resolution constitute a limitation that might restrict potential brain-computer interface (BCI) applications that are based on the CNN model. In the present study, a novel CNN model with source-spatial feature images (SSFIs) as the input is proposed to decode auditory attention tracking states in a cocktail party environment.Approach.We first extract SSFIs using rhythm entropy and weighted minimum norm estimation. Next, we develop a CNN model with three convolutional layers. Furthermore, we estimate the performance of the proposed model via generalized performance, alternative models that deleted or replaced a model's component, and loss curves. Finally, we use a deep transfer model with fine-tuning for a low (poor) behavioral performance group (L-group).Main results.Based on cortical activity reconstructions from the scalp EEGs, the classification accuracy (CA) of the proposed model is 80.4% (chance level: 52.5%), which is superior to that achieved by scalp EEG. Additionally, the performance of the proposed model is more stable when compared to alternative models that delete or replace specific model components. The proposed model identifies the difference between two auditory attention tracking states (successful versus unsuccessful) at an early stage with a short time window (250 ms after target offset). Furthermore, we propose a deep transfer learning model to improve the classification for the L-group. With this model, the CA of the L-group significantly increase by 5.3%.Significance.Our proposed model improves the performance of a decoder for auditory attention tracking, which could be suitable for relieving the difficulty with the attentional modulation of individual's neural responses. It provides a novel communication channel with auditory cognitive BCI for patients with attention and hearing impairment.

It is the combination of hardware and software which provides non-muscular channel to send the various messages to control the computer. BCI is useful in various medical applications such as patients with neuromuscular injuries, locked-in syndrome (LiS) etc. BC! is not only useful in medical applications, but also useful in lie detection, entertainment, etc. In this paper, spark and rule-KNN based scalable framework has been presented using BC! with the EEG data collected on 20 subjects in which 10 are acted as innocent and 10 are acted as guilty. Using BCI P300, Deceit identification Test (DIT) is performed. To perform DIT, we classify the P300 signals which have a positive peak of 300 ms-1000 ms in one stimulus start. Data processing is performed with band pass filter to cut the frequency ranges and features are extracted using non-parametric weighted feature extraction followed by rule based discriminant classification. For training and testing, the data ratio selected as 80:20 and achieved the accuracy 92.46 %. Proposed framework provides better results in comparison with existing models presented in literature. Hence this model is accurate, scalable and fault tolerant. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

FCD lesions were found in 50 to 75% of surgically treated epilepsies. Seizures due to FCD can manifest at any time during lifespan (from early infancy to late adulthood) but tend to more commonly occur in young children (before 5 years of age). Both clinical and histopathological data suggest that FCD is a heterogeneous group of congenital neurodevelopmental disorders. Type I FCD (in particular type Ia) is highly reminiscent of the fetal histological/architectural pattern (that is distinctly microcolumnar) seen in the first half of gestation (about 22 weeks in the human fetus), while type II FCD is characterized by the presence of abnormal cells (dysmorphic neurons with or without balloon cell) and is associated with several somatic and germline mutations in mTOR pathway. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a noninvasive window for the in vivo detection of FCD. Epilepsies associated with FCD represent a broad spectrum of diseases with distinct electroclinical presentations that vary from focal epilepsy with normal development and preserved intellect to severe epileptic encephalopathies (generalized epilepsy phenotype) with neurodevelopmental delay. Seizures are usually frequent, highly stereotyped, and commonly manifest early in life. Epilepsy due to FCD may initially respond to medical treatment but eventually becomes pharmacoresistant and needs surgery in the majority of cases. Presurgical evaluation has several essential steps that include: (1) confirmation of epilepsy diagnosis and excluding genetic and metabolic causes, (2) definition of pharmacoresistance and the timing of presurgical evaluation (in children with neurodevelopmental delay, it should be started as soon as possible), (3) localization of the epileptogenic zone (with noninvasive techniques first and, if needed, with intracranial electroencephalography [EEG]), and (4) establishment of the anatomical relationships between epileptogenic and functional/eloquent cortices.

This paper proposes a novel decision-making selector (DMS) to integrate classification decisions of different frequency recognition methods based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) which were used in decoding steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Methods: The DMS method selects a decision more likely to be correct from two methods namely as M1 and M2 by separating the M1-false and M2-false trials. To measure the uncertainty of each decision, feature vectors were extracted using the largest and second largest correlation coefficients corresponding to all the stimulus frequencies. The proposed method was evaluated by integrating all pairs of 7 CCA-based algorithms, including CCA, individual template-based CCA (ITCCA), multi-set CCA (MsetCCA), L1-regularized multi-way CCA (L1-MCCA), filter bank CCA (FBCCA), extended CCA (ECCA), and task-related component analysis (TRCA). Main results: The experimental results obtained from a 40-target dataset of thirty-five subjects showed that the proposed DMS method was validated to obtain an enhanced performance by integrating the algorithms with close accuracies. Conclusion: The results suggest that the proposed DMS method is effective in integrating decisions of different methods to improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCIs.

However, highly resolved information on small neuronal populations required in epilepsy diagnostics is lost and can be detected only intracranially. Next-generation on-scalp magnetencephalography (MEG) sensors aim to retrieve information unavailable to conventional non-invasive brain imaging techniques. To evaluate the benefits of on-scalp MEG in epilepsy, we performed the first-ever such measurement on an epilepsy patient. Methods: Conducted as a benchmarking study focusing on interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) detectability, an on-scalp high-temperature superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (high-Tc SQUID) system was compared to a conventional, low-temperature SQUID system. Coregistration of electroencephalopraphy (EEG) was performed. A novel machine learning-based IED-detection algorithm was developed to aid identification of on-scalp MEG unique IEDs. Results: Conventional MEG contained 24 IEDs. On-scalp MEG revealed 47 IEDs (16 co-registered by EEG, 31 unique to the on-scalp MEG recording). Conclusion: Our results indicate that on-scalp MEG might capture IEDs not seen by other non-invasive modalities. Significance: On-scalp MEG has the potential of improving non-invasive epilepsy evaluation. (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Metin			A novel feature extraction method for bearing fault classification with one dimensional ternary patterns	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Feature extraction; 1D-TP; Fault classification; Diagnosis; Artificial intelligence; Bearing fault in servo-motor	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; BALL-BEARING; EPILEPTIC EEG; DIAGNOSIS	Bearing is one of the most critical parts used in rotary machines. Bearing faults break down the mechanism where it is located. Moreover, the faults may cause to malfunction by spreading to the entire system. Thus this may result in catastrophic failure eventually. Precise and decisive feature extraction from the raw vibration signal maintains to be one of the current topics explored for fault diagnosis in bearings. In this study, vibration signals are obtained from bearings which are formed with artificial faults of specific dimensions from a bearing test setup. Instead of employing traditional feature extraction methods found in the literature, a novel feature extraction method for bearing faults called one-dimensional ternary pattern (1D-TP) is applied. The proposed approach is a statistical method that uses patterns obtained from comparisons between neighbors of each value on vibration signals. The study aims to identify the size (mm) of the fault by determining the bearing part (inner ring, outer ring, ball) from which the faults in the bearings are caused. Several classification techniques were performed by using ternary patterns with RF (Random Forest), k-NN (1<-nearest neighbor), SVM (Support Vector Machine), BayesNet, ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) models. As a result of analyzing the signals obtained from the experimental setup with the proposed model, 91.25% for dataset_1 (different speed), 100% for dataset_2 (fault type - inner ring, outer ring, ball) and 100% for dataset_3 (fault size (mm)) success rates are determined.

Hybrid brain-computer interface with motor imagery and error-related brain activity	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; error-related potentials; motor imagery; EEG; common spatial patterns; hybrid BCI; BCI feedback	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPATIAL FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; BCI	Objective. Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems read and interpret brain activity directly from the brain. They can provide a means of communication or locomotion for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases or stroke. However, non-stationarity of brain activity limits the reliable transfer of the algorithms that were trained during a calibration session to real-time BCI control. One source of non-stationarity is the user's brain response to the BCI output (feedback), for instance, whether the BCI feedback is perceived as an error by the user or not. By taking such sources of non-stationarity into account, the reliability of the BCI can be improved. Approach. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time implementation of a hybrid motor imagery BCI combining the information from the motor imagery signal and the error-related brain activity simultaneously so as to gain benefit from both sources. Main results. We show significantly improved performance in real-time BCI control across 12 participants, compared to a conventional motor imagery BCI. The significant improvement is in terms of classification accuracy, target hit rate, subjective perception of control and information-transfer rate. Moreover, our offline analyses of the recorded EEG data show that the error-related brain activity provides a more reliable source of information than the motor imagery signal. Significance. This work shows, for the first time, that the error-related brain activity classifier compared to the motor imagery classifier is more consistent when trained on calibration data and tested during online control. This likely explains why the proposed hybrid BCI allows for a more reliable means of communication or rehabilitation for patients in need.

Epilepsy is diagnosed in several ways, one of which is a test known as EEG. The process of examining brain activity is a long and error-prone process. Researchers developed machine learning algorithms to identify epileptic seizures through available datasets. This study aims to compare the performance of a Machine Learning ML model with classical feature engineering approach and RNN for seizure detection in imbalanced dataset. In the experiment, feature engineering improved the recall dramatically in the classical pipeline and slightly improved it in RNN where there is no (manual) feature engineering., The AUC also had increased after feature engineering in classical pipeline and RNN, exceeding 95%. it was clear that the feature engineering improved the performance dramatically in the classical pipeline, and that the order of the feature engineering and resampling (downsampling) didn't affect the performance, and although applying a classical ML model on manually extracted features and RNN gave approximately close results, the recall which spots every seizure was better in RNN comparing to the classical approach.

It is the representation of the electrical activities of the heart and can be understood using different waves, peaks, and intervals. Several factors affect the functionality of the heart that includes lifestyle, stress, daily diet, etc. Coffee, the most widely consumed beverage in the world, is an integral part of everyday life. Caffeine, the prime constituent of coffee, is believed to affect the heart physiology. However, the effect of consumption of caffeinated coffee on the cardiac electrophysiological changes, estimated from the morphological features (e.g., peaks, waves, intervals), is controversial. This has led to the exploration of other feature extraction methods to detect the changes accurately. In recent years, the statistical and entropy-based features have emerged as an efficient method to extract hidden patterns from the ECG signal. These features have been successfully explored in arrhythmia detection, noise removal, biometric identification, etc. Hence, we hypothesized that the statistical and entropy-based features could be efficiently used in detecting the changes in the ECG signal after coffee consumption. For the evaluation of our hypothesis, 5-sec ECG segments were extracted from the recorded ECG signals from 14 volunteers in pre- and post-coffee consumption conditions. From each segment, the statistical and entropy-based features were computed. Then, the statistically significant features were extracted using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. The results showed a significant difference in the statistical parameters post-consumption of coffee. Further, to validate our findings, several machine learning models were used for the automatic detection of these changes, and the results show the highest classification accuracy of 75%. The results support our hypothesis that the statistical and entropy-based features can efficiently detect the changes in the ECG signals, which is induced by coffee consumption. The findings of the proposed hypothesis may open up a new research arena of detecting the presence of different drugs and alcohol in the human body by analyzing the ECG signals.

Therefore, ErrPs must be decoded. The aim of this study was to evaluate ErrP decoding using combinations of different feature types and classifiers in BCI paradigms involving motor execution (ME) and imagination (MI). Fifteen healthy subjects performed 510 (ME) and 390 (MI) trials of right/left wrist extensions and foot dorsiflexions. Sham BCI feedback was delivered with an accuracy of 80% (ME) and 70% (MI). Continuous EEG was recorded and divided into ErrP and NonErrP epochs. Temporal, spectral, and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) marginals and template matching features were extracted, and all combinations of feature types were classified using linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and random forest classifiers. ErrPs were elicited for both ME and MI paradigms, and the average classification accuracies were significantly higher than the chance level. The highest average classification accuracy was obtained using temporal features and a combination of temporal + DWT features classified with random forest; 89 +/- 9% and 83 +/- 9% for ME and MI, respectively. These results generally indicate that temporal features should be used when detecting ErrPs, but there is great inter-subject variability, which means that user-specific features should be derived to maximize the performance.

Brain-computer interfacing offers a solution for their inability to communicate by enabling motor-independent communication. Straightforward and convenient in-session communication is essential in clinical environments. The present study introduces a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based binary communication paradigm that requires limited preparation time and merely nine optodes. Eighteen healthy participants performed two mental imagery tasks, mental drawing and spatial navigation, to answer yes/no questions during one of two auditorily cued time windows. Each of the six questions was answered five times, resulting in five trials per answer. This communication paradigm thus combines both spatial (two different mental imagery tasks, here mental drawing for "yes" and spatial navigation for "no") and temporal (distinct time windows for encoding a "yes" and "no" answer) fNIRS signal features for information encoding. Participants' answers were decoded in simulated real-time using general linear model analysis. Joint analysis of all five encoding trials resulted in an average accuracy of 66.67 and 58.33% using the oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin signal respectively. For half of the participants, an accuracy of 83.33% or higher was reached using either the HbO signal or the HbR signal. For four participants, effective communication with 100% accuracy was achieved using either the HbO or HbR signal. An explorative analysis investigated the differentiability of the two mental tasks based solely on spatial fNIRS signal features. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) group single-trial accuracies of 58.33% (using 20 training trials per task) and 60.56% (using 40 training trials per task) could be obtained. Combining the five trials per run using a majority voting approach heightened these MVPA accuracies to 62.04 and 75%. Additionally, an fNIRS suitability questionnaire capturing participants' physical features was administered to explore its predictive value for evaluating general data quality. Obtained questionnaire scores correlated significantly (r = -0.499) with the signal-to-noise of the raw light intensities. While more work is needed to further increase decoding accuracy, this study shows the potential of answer encoding using spatiotemporal fNIRS signal features or spatial fNIRS signal features only.

Blood oxygenation and deoxygenation spatial dynamics exhibit pronounced hemispheric lateralization when performing motor tasks with the left and right hands. This fact allowed us to reveal biomarkers of hemodynamical response of the motor cortex on the motor execution, and use them for designing a sensing method for classification of the type of movement. The recognition accuracy of real movements is close to 100%, while the classification accuracy of imaginary movements is lower but quite high (at the level of 90%). The advantage of the proposed method is its ability to classify real and imaginary movements with sufficiently high efficiency without the need for recalculating parameters. The proposed system can serve as a sensor of motor activity to be used for neurorehabilitation after severe brain injuries, including traumas and strokes.

Recently, many state-of-the-art approaches have been proposed for decoding action intention understanding. Although these methods have some advantages, it is still necessary to design other tools that can more efficiently classify the action intention understanding signals. New Method:Based on EEG, we first applied phase lag index (PLI) and weighted phase lag index (WPLI) to construct functional connectivity matrices in five frequency bands and 63 micro-time windows, then calculated nine graph metrics from these matrices and subsequently used the network metrics as features to classify different brain signals related to action intention understanding. Results:Compared with the single methods (PLI or WPLI), the combination method (PLI+WPLI) demonstrates some overwhelming victories. Most of the average classification accuracies exceed 70%, and some of them approach 80%. In statistical tests of brain network, many significantly different edges appear in the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal regions. Conclusions:Weighted brain networks can effectively retain data information. The integrated method proposed in this study is extremely effective for investigating action intention understanding. Both the mirror neuron and mentalizing systems participate as collaborators in the process of action intention understanding.

In the light of broad evidence demonstrating the potential sub-optimality of ranking-based feature selection by any criterion, we propose to extend this focus with an information theoretic learning-driven feature transformation concept. Methods: We present a maximum mutual information linear transformation and a nonlinear transformation framework derived by a general definition of the feature transformation learning problem. Empirical assessments are performed based on electroencephalographic data recorded during a four class motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) task. Exploiting the state-of-the-art methods for initial feature vector construction, we compare the proposed approaches with conventional feature selection-based dimensionality reduction techniques, which are widely used in brain interfaces. Furthermore, for the multi-class problem, we present and exploit a hierarchical graphical model-based BCI decoding system. Results: Both binary and multi-class decoding analyses demonstrate significantly better performances with the proposed methods. Conclusion: Information theoretic feature transformations are capable of tackling potential confounders of conventional approaches in various settings. Significance: We argue that this concept provides significant insights to extend the focus on feature selection heuristics to a broader definition of feature transformation learning in brain interfaces.

As aBCI introduces personal affective factors into human-computer interaction, it could potentially enrich the user's experience during the interaction. Successful emotion recognition plays a key role in such a system. The state-of-the-art aBCIs leverage machine learning techniques which consist in acquiring affective electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the user and calibrating the classifier to the affective patterns of the user. Many studies have reported satisfactory recognition accuracy using this paradigm. However, affective neural patterns are volatile over time even for the same subject. The recognition accuracy cannot be maintained if the usage of aBCI prolongs without recalibration. Existing studies have overlooked the performance evaluation of aBCI during long-term use. In this paper, we propose SAFE-an EEG dataset for stable affective feature selection. The dataset includes multiple recording sessions spanning across several days for each subject. Multiple sessions across different days were recorded so that the long-term recognition performance of aBCI can be evaluated. Based on this dataset, we demonstrate that the recognition accuracy of aBCIs deteriorates when re-calibration is ruled out during long-term usage. Then, we propose a stable feature selection method to choose the most stable affective features, for mitigating the accuracy deterioration to a lesser extent and maximizing the aBCI performance in the long run. We invite other researchers to test the performance of their aBCI algorithms on this dataset, and especially to evaluate the long-term performance of their methods.

Real-Time Localization of Epileptogenic Foci EEG Signals: An FPGA-Based Implementation	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						electroencephalogram; epileptic EEG signal classification; epilepsy; epileptogenic focus; real-time implementation; FPGA	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; SEIZURE DETECTION; INTERICTAL EEG; LOG ENERGY; CLASSIFICATION; DEFINITION; FEATURES; SPIKES; SYSTEM; EMD	The epileptogenic focus is a brain area that may be surgically removed to control of epileptic seizures. Locating it is an essential and crucial step prior to the surgical treatment. However, given the difficulty of determining the localization of this brain region responsible of the initial seizure discharge, many works have proposed machine learning methods for the automatic classification of focal and non-focal electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. These works use automatic classification as an analysis tool for helping neurosurgeons to identify focal areas off-line, out of surgery, during the processing of the huge amount of information collected during several days of patient monitoring. In turn, this paper proposes an automatic classification procedure capable of assisting neurosurgeons online, during the resective epilepsy surgery, to refine the localization of the epileptogenic area to be resected, if they have doubts. This goal requires a real-time implementation with as low a computational cost as possible. For that reason, this work proposes both a feature set and a classifier model that minimizes the computational load while preserving the classification accuracy at 95.5%, a level similar to previous works. In addition, the classification procedure has been implemented on a FPGA device to determine its resource needs and throughput. Thus, it can be concluded that such a device can embed the whole classification process, from accepting raw signals to the delivery of the classification results in a cost-effective Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA device.

J	Husain, AM				Husain, Aatif M.			To Wean or Not to Wean: Machine Learning to the Rescue	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS; BURST-SUPPRESSION; EEG; COMA	Intravenous third-line anesthetic agents are typically titrated in refractory status epilepticus to achieve either seizure suppression or burst suppression on continuous EEG. However, the optimum treatment paradigm is unknown and little data exist to guide the withdrawal of anesthetics in refractory status epilepticus. Premature withdrawal of anesthetics risks the recurrence of seizures, whereas the prolonged use of anesthetics increases the risk of treatment-associated adverse effects. This study sought to measure the accuracy of features of EEG activity during anesthetic weaning in refractory status epilepticus as predictors of successful weaning from intravenous anesthetics. We prespecified a successful anesthetic wean as the discontinuation of intravenous anesthesia without developing recurrent status epilepticus, and a wean failure as either recurrent status epilepticus or the resumption of anesthesia for the purpose of treating an EEG pattern concerning for incipient status epilepticus. We evaluated 2 types of features as predictors of successful weaning: spectral components of the EEG signal and spatial-correlation-based measures of functional connectivity. The results of these analyses were used to train a classifier to predict wean outcome. Forty-seven consecutive anesthetic weans (23 successes, 24 failures) were identified from a single-center cohort of patients admitted with refractory status epilepticus from 2016 to 2019. Spectral components of the EEG revealed no significant differences between successful and unsuccessful weans. Analysis of functional connectivity measures revealed that successful anesthetic weans were characterized by the emergence of larger, more densely connected, and more highly clustered spatial functional networks, yielding 75.5% (95% CI: 73.1%-77.8%) testing accuracy in a bootstrap analysis using a holdout sample of 20% of data for testing and 74.6% (95% CI: 73.2%-75.9%) testing accuracy in a secondary external validation cohort, with an area under the curve of 83.3%. Distinct signatures in the spatial networks of functional connectivity emerge during successful anesthetic liberation in status epilepticus; these findings are absent in patients with anesthetic wean failure. Identifying features that emerge during successful anesthetic weaning may allow faster and more successful anesthetic liberation after refractory status epilepticus.

There are three scenarios in which ES may occur. The first one is represented by West Syndrome (WS): ES occur in a previously non encephalopathic infant in association with the development of a hypsarrhythmic EEG pattern. In most cases, standard treatment with Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH), steroids or vigabatrin leads to a reversal of the electroclinical picture. The second scenario is represented by Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs): ES are documented, often along other seizures types, in an infant who often shows developmental delay since birth; the EEG pattern is pathological both in wakefulness and in sleep, without typical features of hypsarrhythmia; therapies (with the exception of few potentially treatable syndromes) are poorly effective. The last scenario is represented by ES in the context of Focal Epilepsies (FEs): ES, sometimes showing focal signs or closely related to focal seizures, are associated with focal brain lesions. Treatment with ACTH, steroids or vigabatrin may not be effective as well as antiepileptic drugs for focal epilepsies. In drug-resistant patients, surgery should be considered. Although there are some gaps in our current scientific knowledge concerning the peculiar electroclinical and physiopathological features of ES, we nowadays possess the necessary tools to correctly frame this unique seizure type into one of these scenarios and therefore properly manage the diagnostic and therapeutic workup.

Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Reverse Biorthogonal Wavelet Scalograms for Automatic Identification of High Frequency Micro-Scale Spike Transients in the Post-Hypoxic-Ischemic EEG	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is currently limited and prognostic biological markers are required for early identification of at risk infants at birth. Using pre-clinical data from our fetal sheep models, we have shown that micro-scale EEG patterns, such as high-frequency spikes and sharp waves, evolve superimposed on a significantly suppressed background during the early hours of recovery (0-6 h), after an HI insult. In particular, we have demonstrated that the number of micro-scale gamma spike transients peaks within the first 2-2.5 hours of the insult and automatically quantified sharp waves in this period are predictive of neural outcome. This period of time is optimal for the initiation of neuroprotection treatments such as therapeutic hypothermia, which has a limited window of opportunity for implementation of 6 h or less after an HI insult. Clinically, it is hard to determine when an insult has started and thus the window of opportunity for treatment. Thus, reliable automatic algorithms that could accurately identify EEG patterns that denote the phase of injury is a valuable clinical tool. We have previously developed successful machine-learning strategies for the identification of HI micro- scale EEG patterns in a preterm fetal sheep model of HI. This paper employs, for the first time, reverse biorthogonal Wavelet-Scalograms (WS) as the inputs to a 17-layer deep-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for the precise identification of high-frequency micro-scale spike transients that occur in the 80-120Hz gamma band during first 2 h period of an HI insult. The rbio-WS-CNN classifier robustly identified spike transients with an exceptionally high-performance of 99.82%.

Evaluating five different adaptive decomposition methods for EEG signal seizure detection and classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DOMAIN; PREDICTION; EPILEPSY; SPECTRUM; EMD	Signal processing and machine learning methods are valuable tools in epilepsy research, potentially assisting in diagnosis, seizure detection, prediction and real-time event detection during long term monitoring. Recent approaches involve the decomposition of EEG signals into different modes in a data-dependent and adaptive way, which may provide advantages over commonly used Fourier based methods when dealing with nonlinear and non-stationary data. Examples of such methods include empirical mode decomposition (EMD), extended EMD (EEMD), complete EEMD with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and variational mode decomposition (VMD). In this work, feature sets extracted from original non-decomposed signals and from the aforementioned adaptive decomposition methods are evaluated for the classification of EEG seizure data using two freely available datasets. We provide a previously unavailable common methodology for comparing the performance of these methods for EEG seizure detection, with the use of the same classifiers, parameters and spectral and time domain features. Overall, results were similar between the evaluated decomposition methods, with slightly superior values for VMD and CEEMDAN. Features extracted from the original non-decomposed signals resulted in inferior class separability, but fairly accurate predictions could still be achieved with specific classifiers. The evaluated decomposition methods are promising approaches for seizure detection, but their use should be judiciously analysed, especially in situations that require real-time processing and computational power is an issue. Another contribution of this work is the development of python packages for EWT (ewtpy) and VMD (vmdpy), already available at the PyPI repository. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we introduce a first-ever DNN-based generalized approach to estimate reaction time (RT) using the periodogram representation of single-trial EEG in a visual stimulus-response experiment with 48 participants. We have designed a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict and classify RTs for each trial. Though deep neural networks are widely known for classification applications, cascading FCNN/CNN with the Random Forest model, we designed a robust regression-based estimator to predict RT. With the FCNN model, the accuracies obtained for binary and 3-class classification were 93% and 76%, respectively, which further improved with the use of CNN (94% and 78%, respectively). The regression-based approach predicted RTs with correlation coefficients (CC) of 0.78 and 0.80 for FCNN and CNN, respectively. Investigating further, we found that the left central as well as parietal and occipital lobes were crucial for predicting RT, with significant activities in the theta and alpha frequency bands.

A Comparative Analysis of Wavelet-Based FEMG Signal Denoising with Threshold Functions and Facial Expression Classification Using SVM and LSSVM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING			English	Article						Facial Electromyogram; Wavelet Transform; Support Vector Machine; Least-square Support Vector Machine	MACHINE; EMG; RECOGNITION; TRANSFORM; SCHEME	This work presents a technique for the analysis of facial electromyogram signal activities to classify five different facial expressions for computer-muscle interfacing applications. Facial electromyogram (FEMG) is a technique for recording the asynchronous activation of neuronal inside the face muscles with non-invasive electrodes. FEMG pattern recognition is a difficult task for the researcher, where classification accuracy is key concerns. Artifacts, such as eyeblink activity and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals interference, can corrupt these FEMG signals and directly affected the classification results. In this work, a robust wavelet-based thresholding technique, which comprised of a wavelet transform (WT) method and the statistical threshold, is proposed to remove the different artifacts from FEMG datasets and improve recognition accuracy rate. A set of five different raw FEMG data set was analyzed. Four wavelet basis functions, namely, haar, coif3, sym3, and bior4.4, were considered. The performance parameters (signal-to-artifact ratio (SAR) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) were utilized to understand the effect of the proposed signal denoising protocol. After denoising, the effectiveness of different statically features has been extracted. Two pattern recognition algorithms support vector machine (SVM) and the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) are implemented to classify extracted features. The performance accuracy of SVM and LSSVM classifier was evaluated and compared to know which classifier is the best for facial expression classification. The results showed that: (i) the proposed technique for denoising, improves the performance parameter results; (ii) The proposed work gives the best 95.24% classification accuracy.

The human eye tracking system allows researchers to analyse the participant's eye movements during certain activities. This study offers the EOG signals to control the human-computer interface systems with the help of Empirical Mean Curve Decomposition (EMCD) decomposition model. At first, the input EOG signal is provided as input to the EMCD decomposition model, later the resultant signal is given to principal component analysis for dimensional reduction, and then the dimensional reduced signal is offered to multi-wavelet decomposition model. The resultant dimensionally reduced multi-wavelet decomposed signal is passed to the proposed Feature Mapping (FM) model, using thek-means clustering model. Then, the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm is utilised to tune the margin. Next to mapping, the obtained features are provided to the nearest neighbour classifier, to obtain the eye movement. Next to the implementation, the proposed method is compared with the existing methods, and it is witnessed that the proposed methodology gives the superior performance in correspondence with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, false positive rate, false negative rate, negative predictive value, false discovery rate, F1 score and Mathews correlation coefficient.

We recently showed that the detection of motor activity during a median nerve stimulation from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals could be used to alert the medical staff that a patient is waking up and trying to move under general anesthesia [1], [2]. In this work, we measure the accuracy and false positive rate in detecting motor imagery of several deep learning models (EEGNet, deep convolutional network and shallow convolutional network) directly trained on filtered EEG data. We compare them with efficient non-deep approaches, namely, a linear discriminant analysis based on common spatial patterns, the minimum distance to Riemannian mean algorithm applied to covariance matrices, a logistic regression based on a tangent space projection of covariance matrices (TS+LR). The EEGNet improves significantly the classification performance comparing to other classifiers (p-value < 0.01); moreover it outperforms the best non-deep classifier (TS+LR) for 7.2% of accuracy. This approach promises to improve intraoperative awareness detection during general anesthesia.

In this paper, the study adopted a version of the n-back task as a cognitively loading secondary task on the primary task, i.e., driving; where drivers drove in three different simulated driving scenarios. This paper has taken a multimodal approach to perform 'intelligent multivariate data analytics' based on machine learning (ML). Here, the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) are used for driver cognitive load classification. Moreover, physiological measures have proven to be sophisticated in cognitive load identification, yet it suffers from confounding factors and noise. Therefore, this work uses multi-component signals, i.e., physiological measures and vehicular features to overcome that problem. Both multiclass and binary classifications have been performed to distinguish normal driving from cognitive load tasks. To identify the optimal feature set, two feature selection algorithms, i.e., sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) and random forest have been applied where out of 323 features, a subset of 42 features has been selected as the best feature subset. For the classification, RF has shown better performance withF(1)-score of 0.75 and 0.80 than two other algorithms. Moreover, the result shows that using multicomponent features classifiers could classify better than using features from a single source.

Evaluation procedures of most of these techniques are based on the answers/evidence provided by the learners. The current evaluation techniques are not capable enough to analyze the psychophysiological parameters to evaluate the actual biological status of the learners. This study suggests an approach to analyze the psychophysiological parameters of the learners to evaluate their performance. The study is focused on utilizing the most suitable quantitative analysis technique to predict whether the learner had previous knowledge about a particular learning content. The first two objective levels of the Bloom's Taxonomy were assessed in this study; pictures of human faces were used to evaluate the first level, and mathematical equations were used to evaluate the second level. The main findings of this research are, 1) the psychophysiological signals captured from the human brain during the engagement in the first two objective levels of the Bloom's Taxonomy showed a clear difference, 2) the amplitude level for the positive activation in the brain cortex was higher when experimented with pictures of mathematical equations than using pictures of human faces. These findings merit further research in this area.	[Maduranga, N. H. P., I; Ekanayake, H. E. M. H.

The clinical presentation of RTT is generally severe and includes developmental regression and marked neurologic impairment. Insulin-Like growth factor 1 (IGF1) ameliorates RTT-relevant phenotypes in animal models and improves some clinical manifestations in early human trials. However, it remains unclear whether IGF1 treatment has an impact on cortical electrophysiology in line withMeCP2's role in network formation, and whether these electrophysiological changes are related to clinical response. We performed clinical assessments and resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in eighteen patients with classic RTT, nine of whom were treated with IGF1. Among the treated patients, we distinguished those who showed improvements after treatment (responders) from those who did not show any changes (nonresponders). Clinical assessments were carried out for all individuals with RTT at baseline and 12 months after treatment. Network measures were derived using statistical modelling techniques based on interelectrode coherence measures. We found significant interaction between treatment groups and timepoints, indicating an effect of IGF1 on network measures. We also found a significant effect of responder status and timepoint, indicating that these changes in network measures are associated with clinical response to treatment. Further, we found baseline variability in network characteristics, and a machine learning model using these measures applied to pretreatment data predicted treatment response with 100% accuracy (100% sensitivity and 100% specificity) in this small patient group. These results highlight the importance of network pathology in RTT, as well as providing preliminary evidence for the potential of network measures as tools for the characterisation of disease subtypes and as biomarkers for clinical trials.

Patients were grouped based on their cognitive functions or their EEG patterns. The mean cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFVm) of the unilateral middle cerebral artery was measured using TCD and was used to calculate various relevant parameters. The 19 patients participated in a total of 54 effective TCD-vEEG monitoring sessions. We found a significant effect of clinical severity for the following measurements: spike wave index (SWI), peak and average deep sleep stage (N3) CBFVm, peak, average and minimum deep sleep and awake CBFVm, and CBFVm oscillations during deep sleep. Nevertheless, CBFVm oscillations were not related to SWI. Furthermore, CBFVm oscillations revealed a statistically significant difference between the near-ESES and asymmetric-ESES groups. CBFVm oscillations may reflect the neuro-vascular coupling process associated with ESES disfunction. Understanding the relationship between CBFVm oscillations and epileptic activity will be important for assessing the neuropsychological damage associated with ESES and for developing treatment options for this and other diseases.

Virtual Reality (VR) technology enables users to interact with computer-generated simulated environments and to provide multi-modal sensory feedback. Using VR systems can, however, be error-prone. In this paper, we investigate the presence of ErrPs when Virtual Reality users face 3 types of visualization errors: (Te) tracking errors when manipulating virtual objects, (Fe) feedback errors, and (Be) background anomalies. We conducted an experiment in which 15 participants were exposed to the 3 types of errors while performing a center-out pick and place task in virtual reality. The results showed that tracking errors generate error-related potentials, the other types of errors did not generate such discernible patterns. In addition, we show that it is possible to detect the ErrPs generated by tracking losses in single trial, with an accuracy of 85%. This constitutes a first step towards the automatic detection of error-related potentials in VR applications, paving the way to the design of adaptive and self-corrective VR/AR applications by exploiting information directly from the user's brain.

Dynamic network properties of the interictal brain determine whether seizures appear focal or generalised	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ILAE COMMISSION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; POSITION PAPER; EPILEPSY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; MISDIAGNOSIS; OSCILLATIONS; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Current explanatory concepts suggest seizures emerge from ongoing dynamics of brain networks. It is unclear how brain network properties determine focal or generalised seizure onset, or how network properties can be described in a clinically-useful manner. Understanding network properties would cast light on seizure-generating mechanisms and allow to quantify to which extent a seizure is focal or generalised. Functional brain networks were estimated in segments of scalp-EEG without interictal discharges (68 people with epilepsy, 38 controls). Simplified brain dynamics were simulated using a computer model. We introduce: Critical Coupling (C-c), the ability of a network to generate seizures; Onset Index (OI), the tendency of a region to generate seizures; and Participation Index (PI), the tendency of a region to become involved in seizures. C-c was lower in both patient groups compared with controls. OI and PI were more variable in focal-onset than generalised-onset cases. In focal cases, the regions with highest OI and PI corresponded to the side of seizure onset. Properties of interictal functional networks from scalp EEG can be estimated using a computer model and used to predict seizure likelihood and onset patterns. This may offer potential to enhance diagnosis through quantification of seizure type using inter-ictal recordings.

Thus, there is strong value in methods that provide a temporally resolved index of WM load. While univariate EEG signals have been identified that vary with WM load, recent advances in multivariate analytic approaches suggest that there may be rich sources of information that do not generate reliable univariate signatures. Here, using data from four published studies (n = 286 and >250,000 trials), we demonstrate that multivariate analysis of EEG voltage topography provides a sensitive index of the number of items stored in WM that generalizes to novel human observers. Moreover, multivariate load detection ("mvLoad") can provide robust information at the single-trial level, exceeding the sensitivity of extant univariate approaches. We show that this method tracks WM load in a manner that is (1) independent of the spatial position of the memoranda, (2) precise enough to differentiate item-by-item increments in the number of stored items, (3) generalizable across distinct tasks and stimulus displays, and (4) correlated with individual differences in WM behavior. Thus, this approach provides a powerful complement to univariate analytic approaches, enabling temporally resolved tracking of online memory storage in humans.	[Adam, Kirsten C.

The majority of these people are able to keep the symptoms under control; however, some still suffer with frequent seizures. As such, methods for detecting the occurrences of these episodes are required. The main source of data for detecting seizures is the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Machine Learning algorithms, for instance, can be applied to these signals to perform such a task. Moreover, Deep Learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have been proven to be effective to the problem with some results achieving an accuracy of 93% or more. Nevertheless, there is little exploration towards applying these types of networks in an embedded system environment and even less with the aim of building a wearable device, which could forewarn a patient of impeding episodes. This article presents the steps taken to evaluate an architecture that can be applied to intra-patient data considering a low resource environment. We consider the application of said architecture in an embedded platform with estimates for time and memory consumption to build a wearable device. An architectural overview of such a device is also discussed.

In this work, we built a framework to understand the temporal (when in time) characteristics of speech evoked responses that differentiate prototypical vowels (true phonetic categories) from ambiguous ones (lacking a clear phonetic identity). We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) from in young, healthy adults as they rapidly classified speech sounds along an acoustic-phonetic continuum. Source derived response features were submitted to support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Whole-brain data provided the best decoding of prototypical from ambiguous speech with an accuracy of 95.16% [area under the curve (AUC) 95.14%; F1-score 95.00%] at 120 ms. Separate analyses using left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) data showed that LH activity was a better predictor of speech categorization as compared to RH (89.03% vs. 86.45% accuracy). Notably, CP was decoded less robustly and later in time using hemisphere-specific data compared to whole-brain data. Our results are consistent with notions that the early ERPs (e.g., P2) are sensitive to CP and the general dominance of LH in auditory-linguistic processing.

A number of algorithms that can infer nonnegative latent factors have been developed, but most of these assume a specific noise kernel. This is insufficient to deal with complex noise in real scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical Dirichlet process nonnegative matrix factorization (DPNMF) model in which the Gaussian mixture model is used to approximate the complex noise distribution. Moreover, the model is cast in the nonparametric Bayesian framework by using Dirichlet process mixture to infer the necessary number of Gaussian components. We derive a mean-field variational inference algorithm for the proposed nonparametric Bayesian model. We first test the model on synthetic data sets contaminated by Gaussian, sparse and mixed noise. We then apply it to extract muscle synergies from the electromyographic (EMG) signal and to select discriminative features for motor imagery single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. Experimental results demonstrate that DPNMF performs better in extracting the latent nonnegative factors in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

The current study aims to identify features of EEG-based functional connectivity, neuropsychological performance, and impulsivity that can classify individuals with AUD (N = 30) from unaffected controls (CTL, N = 30) using random forest classification. The features included were: (i) EEG source functional connectivity (FC) of the default mode network (DMN) derived using eLORETA algorithm, (ii) neuropsychological scores from the Tower of London test (TOLT) and the visual span test (VST), and (iii) impulsivity factors from the Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS). The random forest model achieved a classification accuracy of 80% and identified 29 FC connections (among 66 connections per frequency band), 3 neuropsychological variables from VST (total number of correctly performed trials in forward and backward sequences and average time for correct trials in forward sequence) and all four impulsivity scores (motor, non-planning, attentional, and total) as significantly contributing to classifying individuals as either AUD or CTL. Although there was a significant age difference between the groups, most of the top variables that contributed to the classification were not significantly correlated with age. The AUD group showed a predominant pattern of hyperconnectivity among 25 of 29 significant connections, indicating aberrant network functioning during resting state suggestive of neural hyperexcitability and impulsivity. Further, parahippocampal hyperconnectivity with other DMN regions was identified as a major hub region dysregulated in AUD (13 connections overall), possibly due to neural damage from chronic drinking, which may give rise to cognitive impairments, including memory deficits and blackouts. Furthermore, hypoconnectivity observed in four connections (prefrontal nodes connecting posterior right-hemispheric regions) may indicate a weaker or fractured prefrontal connectivity with other regions, which may be related to impaired higher cognitive functions. The AUD group also showed poorer memory performance on the VST task and increased impulsivity in all factors compared to controls. Features from all three domains had significant associations with one another. These results indicate that dysregulated neural connectivity across the DMN regions, especially relating to hyperconnected parahippocampal hub as well as hypoconnected prefrontal hub, may potentially represent neurophysiological biomarkers of AUD, while poor visual memory performance and heightened impulsivity may serve as cognitive-behavioral indices of AUD.

The main problem of non-invasive BCI technology is that the spatial resolution of signal is low and it is easy to be drowned by noise. Therefore, this paper reviews the key technologies and the existing challenges of non-invasive BCI technology from the aspect of signal detection and processing, and discusses its future application prospects. However, it is still a great challenge for non-invasive BCI technology to become the mainstream in the future.

Recently, an increasing number of invasive and noninvasive solutions for sensory stimulation have demonstrated the capability of providing a range of sensations to upper limb amputees. However, the cortical impact of restored sensation is not clearly understood. Particularly, understanding the cortical connectivity changes at multiple scales (nodal and modular) in response to sensory stimulation, can reveal crucial information on how amputees brain process the sensory stimuli. Using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, we compared the cortical connectivity network in response to sensory feedback provided by targeted transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tTENS) in an upper limb amputee during phantom upper limb movements. We focused our cortical connectivity analysis on four functional modules comprising of 20 brain regions that are primarily associated with a visually guided motor task (visual, motor, somatosensory and multisensory integration (MI)) used in this study. At the modular level, we observed that the hubness (a graph theoretic measure quantifying the importance of brain regions in integrating brain function) of the motor module decreases whereas that of the somatosensory module increases in presence of tTENS feedback. At the nodal level, similar observations were made for the visual and MI regions. This is the first work to reveal the impact of sensory feedback at multiple scales in the cortex of amputees in response to sensory stimulation.

For pharmacoresistant patients, the surgical resection of the critical area is considered a valid clinical solution, therefore, an accurate localization is crucial to minimize neurological damage. In current clinical routine the characterization of the Epileptogenic Zone (EZ) is performed using invasive methods, such as Stereo-ElectroEncephaloGraphy (SEEG). Medical experts perform the tag of neural electrophysiological recordings by visually inspecting the acquired data, a highly time consuming and subjective procedure. Here we show the results of an automatic multi-modal classification method for the evaluation of critical areas in focal epileptic patients. The proposed method represents an attempt in the characterization of brain areas which integrates the anatomical information on neural tissue, inferred using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in combination with spectral features extracted from SEEG recordings.

Patients and methods: From January 2017 to June 2017, 45 patients with TLE underwent temporal lobe resection with intra-operative ECoG at the Beijing Institute of Functional Neurosurgery of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University, China. The scalp EEG, pre-operative and post-operative ECoG were analyzed. Surgical outcome was evaluated with Engel's classification every 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Results: Before temporal lobe resection the ECoG showed a variable amount of interictal spiks in all patients. A different pattern of burst suppression (BS) was recorded in 33.3% (n = 15; male:7, female:8; mean age, 26.9 years; range 3-45 years) in a small zone of temporal cortex. The BS is characterized of a suppression pattern with bursts of high-amplitude spike rhythm or low amplitude fast activity. After the temporal lobe resection, BS was disappeared in 26.7% (4/15), 73.3% (n = 11) showed the focal BS pattern in a cortex adjacent to the margin of resection, 20% (n = 3) had no epileptiform abnormality, and 40% (n = 6) had minor spikes. The mean postoperative follow-up was 14 +/- 2.1 months, 73.3% (n = 11) were class I and 26.7% (n = 4) were class II (Engel's classification). Conclusion: The focal BS was observed during temporal lobectomy and this unusual pattern does not affect the surgical outcome in patients with TLE.

This paper proposes to employ the logarithmic normalized functional singular values as the features for performing the classification of both the two class problem (normal and seizure set) and the three class problem (normal, seizure free and seizure set). Here, the EEGs are taken from two well known datasets. First, each EEG is decomposed via the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to obtain the singular values. Then, the logarithmic normalized functional values of these singular values are calculated to form the feature vectors for performing the classification of the epileptic seizure. Next, different classifiers including the support vector machine (SVM), the k nearest neighbor classifier, the extreme learning machine (ELM) and the artificial neural network (ANN) are employed for performing the classification. Finally, a ten fold cross validation procedure is employed to ensure the reliability and the stability of the classifiers. The computer numerical simulation results show that the k nearest neighbor classifier achieves the best performance compared to other classifiers for performing both the two class epileptic classification and the three class epileptic classification. Our proposed method also achieves the higher classification accuracies compared to the case without performing the logarithmic normalized operation. Moreover, the performance of our proposed method is evaluated on the original EEGs under the white noise environment at different signal to noise ratios. Similar results are obtained.

J	Liu, T; Truong, ND; Nikpour, A; Zhou, LP; Kavehei, O				Liu, Tennison; Truong, Nhan Duy; Nikpour, Armin; Zhou, Luping; Kavehei, Omid			Epileptic Seizure Classification With Symmetric and Hybrid Bilinear Models	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Epilepsy; epileptic seizure classification; EEG; bilinear models; deep learning	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; ILAE	Epilepsy affects nearly 1% of the global population, of which two thirds can be treated by anti-epileptic drugs and a much lower percentage by surgery. Diagnostic procedures for epilepsy and monitoring are highly specialized and labour-intensive. The accuracy of the diagnosis is also complicated by overlapping medical symptoms, varying levels of experience and inter-observer variability among clinical professions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid bilinear deep learning network with an application in the clinical procedures of epilepsy classification diagnosis, where the use of surface electroencephalogram (sEEG) and audiovisual monitoring is standard practice. Hybrid bilinear models based on two types of feature extractors, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are trained using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of one-second sEEG. In the proposed hybrid models, CNNs extract spatio-temporal patterns, while RNNs focus on the characteristics of temporal dynamics in relatively longer intervals given the same input data. Second-order features, based on interactions between these spatio-temporal features are further explored by bilinear pooling and used for epilepsy classification. Our proposed methods obtain an F1-score of 97.4% on the Temple University Hospital Seizure Corpus and 97.2% on the EPILEPSIAE dataset, comparing favourably to existing benchmarks for sEEG-based seizure type classification.

However, classifier trained from previous subjects suffer from performance drop due to some factors, including environmental, physiological and instrumental changes. Concretely speaking, statical distribution alters across subjects, as well as sessions. In this paper, we focus on across-subject problem. Thus, we propose a framework for decoding MEG and matching data distribution across subjects. First, features from Riemannian tangent space were extracted to build common feature space between source domain and target domain. Second, taking advantages of clustering in target domain, supervised subspace learning in source domain and matching the class centroid between two domains, we proposed an improved transfer learning method named class centroid matching (CCM). Several experiments had been conducted on a MEG dataset, which shows that our proposed method is effective to reduce discrepancy across subjects and can achieve a promising performance than other comparable methods.

A systematic review of endovascular stent-electrode arrays, a minimally invasive approach to brain-machine interfaces	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS			English	Review						brain-machine interface; endovascular stent-electrode; minimally invasive; neural interface	CAVERNOUS SINUS EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; STIMULATION; RECORDINGS; BAND	OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to systematically review the feasibility and safety of minimally invasive neurovascular approaches to brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). METHODS A systematic literature review was performed using the PubMed database for studies published between 1986 and 2019. All studies assessing endovascular neural interfaces were included. Additional studies were selected based on review of references of selected articles and review articles. RESULTS Of the 53 total articles identified in the original literature search, 12 studies were ultimately selected. An additional 10 articles were included from other sources, resulting in a total of 22 studies included in this systematic review. This includes primarily preclinical studies comparing endovascular electrode recordings with subdural and epidural electrodes, as well as studies evaluating stent-electrode gauge and material type. In addition, several clinical studies are also included. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular stent-electrode arrays provide a minimally invasive approach to BMIs. Stent-electrode placement has been shown to be both efficacious and safe, although further data are necessary to draw comparisons between subdural and epidural electrode measurements given the heterogeneity of the studies included. Greater access to deep-seated brain regions is now more feasible with stent-electrode arrays; however, further validation is needed in large clinical trials to optimize this neural interface. This includes the determination of ideal electrode material type, venous versus arterial approaches, the feasibility of deep brain stimulation, and more streamlined computational decoding techniques.

J	Pfeiffer, C; Hollenstein, N; Zhang, C; Langer, N				Pfeiffer, Christian; Hollenstein, Nora; Zhang, Ce; Langer, Nicolas			Neural dynamics of sentiment processing during naturalistic sentence reading	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							REGRESSION-BASED ESTIMATION; EMOTIONAL WORDS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; EEG-DATA; FIXATION DURATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; FREQUENCY	When we read, our eyes move through the text in a series of fixations and high-velocity saccades to extract visual information. This process allows the brain to obtain meaning, e.g., about sentiment, or the emotional valence, expressed in the written text. How exactly the brain extracts the sentiment of single words during naturalistic reading is largely unknown. This is due to the challenges of naturalistic imaging, which has previously led researchers to employ highly controlled, timed word-by-word presentations of custom reading materials that lack ecological validity. Here, we aimed to assess the electrical neural correlates of word sentiment processing during naturalistic reading of English sentences. We used a publicly available dataset of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking recordings, and word-level semantic annotations from 7129 words in 400 sentences (Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus; Hollenstein et al., 2018). We computed fixation-related potentials (FRPs), which are evoked electrical responses time-locked to the onset of fixations. A general linear mixed model analysis of FRPs cleaned from visual-and motor-evoked activity showed a topographical difference between the positive and negative sentiment condition in the 224-304 ms interval after fixation onset in left-central and right-posterior electrode clusters. An additional analysis that included word-, phrase-, and sentence-level sentiment predictors showed the same FRP differences for the word-level sentiment, but no additional FRP differences for phrase-and sentence-level sentiment. Furthermore, decoding analysis that classified word sentiment (positive or negative) from sentiment-matched 40-trial average FRPs showed a 0.60 average accuracy (95% confidence interval: [0.58, 0.61]). Control analyses ruled out that these results were based on differences in eye movements or linguistic features other than word sentiment. Our results extend previous research by showing that the emotional valence of lexico-semantic stimuli evoke a fast electrical neural response upon word fixation during naturalistic reading. These results provide an important step to identify the neural processes of lexico-semantic processing in ecologically valid conditions and can serve to improve computer algorithms for natural language processing.

Shift work was introduced during long-endurance missions to reduce the risk of fatigue. However, despite these short work periods and the creation of a fatigue risk management system (FRMS), the occurrence of intense and monotonous phases remains a factor of cognitive fatigue. This fatigue can have an impact on vigilance, attention, and operator performance, leading to reduce mission safety. This paper aims at presenting different ways to characterize the cognitive fatigue of UAS operators. The use of machine learning to estimate cognitive fatigue based on physiological measures is also presented as a promising venue to mitigate these issues. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

In this paper, we propose a novel regional attention convolutional neural network (RACNN) to take full advantage of spectral-spatial-temporal features for EEG motion intention recognition. Time-frequency based analysis is adopted to reveal spectral-temporal features in terms of neural oscillations of primary sensorimotor. The basic idea of RACNN is to identify the activated area of the primary sensorimotor adaptively. The RACNN aggregates a varied number of spectral-temporal features produced by a backbone convolutional neural network into a compact fixed-length representation. Inspired by the neuroscience findings that functional asymmetry of the cerebral hemisphere, we propose a region biased loss to encourage high attention weights for the most critical regions. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets and real-world BCI dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods.

Neural mechanisms underlying expectation-dependent inhibition of distracting information	ELIFE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-SEARCH; STATISTICAL REGULARITIES; ATTENTION; TARGET; SUPPRESSION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SOFTWARE; CAPTURE	Predictions based on learned statistical regularities in the visual world have been shown to facilitate attention and goal-directed behavior by sharpening the sensory representation of goal-relevant stimuli in advance. Yet, how the brain learns to ignore predictable goal-irrelevant or distracting information is unclear. Here, we used EEG and a visual search task in which the predictability of a distractor's location and/or spatial frequency was manipulated to determine how spatial and feature distractor expectations are neurally implemented and reduce distractor interference. We find that expected distractor features could not only be decoded pre-stimulus, but their representation differed from the representation of that same feature when part of the target. Spatial distractor expectations did not induce changes in preparatory neural activity, but a strongly reduced Pd, an ERP index of inhibition. These results demonstrate that neural effects of statistical learning critically depend on the task relevance and dimension (spatial, feature) of predictions.

J	Duc, NT; Lee, B				Duc, Nguyen Thanh; Lee, Boreom			Decoding Brain Dynamics in Speech Perception Based on EEG Microstates Decomposed by Multivariate Gaussian Hidden Markov Model	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Speech perception; EEG microstate; source imaging; microstate functional connectivity; MGHMM	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; NETWORK; STATES; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; CORTEX; PART; MEG	This study aims to reveal dynamic brain networks during speech perception. All male subjects were presented five English vowel [a], [e], [i], [o], and [u] stimuli. Brain dynamics were decoded using multivariate Gaussian hidden Markov model (MGHMM), which trained on spatiotemporal patterns of broadband multivariate event-related potential amplitudes to identify distinct broadband EEG microstates (MS), microstate source imaging, and microstate functional connectivity (mu FC). Obtained results showed fiuctuated cortical generators and mu FC in eight microstates throughout the perception. Microstate source imaging revealed involvements of bilateral (left-side dominance) posterior superior temporal cortex (TC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and supramarginal regions in perception. Precentral cortex where primary motor cortex located was also significantly activated. These regions were early appeared at 96-151 ms (left-side dominance) and at 186-246 ms (left hemisphere only) after the stimuli onset. Results from fiFC revealed significant increases in delta (2.5-4.5 Hz), theta (4.5-8.5 Hz), alpha (12.5-14.5 Hz), beta (22.5-24.5 Hz), low gamma (30.5-32.5, 38.5-40.5 Hz) but decreases in high gamma (42.5-46.5 Hz) bands in perception. Increased FC were observed mainly at; (1) microstate segments 34-95 ms (MS2) and 96-151 ms (MS3) in early stages, (2) microstate intervals 186-246 ms (MS5) and 297-449 ms (MS6) in subsequent stages of perception. We found that stronger statistical FC differences in perception at TCs, with respect to left IFG (Broca' area), left TC, and precentral areas. Furthermore, by conducting a comparative protocol measuring FC distinction degree, we showed performance improvements of 8.01% (p-value D 0.0162), 14.41% (pvalue D 0.006) when compared MGHMM to well established Lehmann-based modified K-means, Atomize and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and 8.791% (p-value D 0.0097) over the combination of Kmeans and sliding window methods, respectively.

The data collected from these devices is extremely important and may be affected by wireless communication environments encouraging a preliminary stage that adapts transmission of data to network dynamics. The paper provides compression and classification schemes for data based on a Hybrid Deep Learning Model (HDLM) that represents data characteristics, acquired data, and energy efficiency data delivery dynamics. Further, the EEG and EMG signals are compressed and classified based on Hybrid Deep Learning Model (HDLM) has been mathematically analyzed. Hence, The system is specifically based on the Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) architecture which extracts discrimination in the multimodal representation of data; it reconstructs data from the latent description with the help of encoder-decoder layers for data analysis. Furthermore, Multi-Modality Adaptive Compression shows its performance, computational complexity and response to different network states has been experimentally analyzed at lab scale numerical analysis. This method is therefore appropriate for mHealth applications, which can improve energy efficiency, minimize capacity, and minimize transmission latency in the mHealth cloud with intelligent preprocessing.

J	Gero, JS; Milovanovic, J				Gero, John S.; Milovanovic, Julie			A framework for studying design thinking through measuring designers' minds, bodies and brains	DESIGN SCIENCE			English	Article						design science; protocol analysis; design cognition; design physiology; design neurocognition	MENTAL STRESS; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; PROTOCOL; BEHAVIOR; STUDENT; MODEL	This paper presents a framework for studying design thinking. Three paradigmatic approaches are described to measure design cognitive processes: design cognition, design physiology and design neurocognition. Specific tools and methods serve each paradigmatic approach. Design cognition is explored through protocol analysis, black-box experiments, surveys and interviews. Design physiology is measured with eye tracking, electrodermal activity, heart rate and emotion tracking. Design neurocognition is measured using electroencephalography, functional near infrared spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Illustrative examples are presented to describe the types of results each method provides about the characteristics of design thinking, such as design patterns, design reasoning, design creativity, design collaboration, the co-evolution of the problem solution space, or design analysis and evaluation. The triangulation of results from the three paradigmatic approaches to studying design thinking provides a synergistic foundation for the understanding of design cognitive processes. Results from such studies generate a source of feedback to designers, design educators and researchers in design science. New models, new tools and new research questions emerge from the integrated approach proposed and lay down future challenges in studying design thinking.

An Efficient Method for Selecting the Optimal Features using Evolutionary Algorithms for Epilepsy Diagnosis	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS			English	Article						Epilepsy; feature selection; EEG; BCI; CSP; NN; EA	EEG; OPTIMIZATION; CLASSIFICATION	One of the important parameters in the brain-computer interface (BCI) system is speed. Therefore, it is always desirable to design a high-speed system that has an acceptable performance, simultaneously. The main idea of this paper is the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to select the optimal features for epilepsy diagnosis by processing the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The lesser the number of features is, the higher will be the usefulness of accuracy of the system to us. Therefore, here, using EAs, some of the features that are redundant in the data and do not contain a lot of information and only increase the complexity of the system are eliminated and the best features are chosen. We select this choice by EAs. Running the feature selection step is after the feature extraction step. In fact, the features were extracted using the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, and then the optimal features were selected from the extracted feature set. This can save a lot of system complexity and reduce system execution time considerably. Finally, at the diagnostic stage, these selected features are given to a simple neural network (NN). The results showed that when the combination of EA and CSP is used, the precision of the system is much higher than when the CSP method is only used, although it contributes significantly to the complexity of the system.

These conditions affect the individual actions like walking, speaking impairment and totally make the person in to locked in state (LIS). To overcome the miserable condition the person need rehabilitation devices through a Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) to satisfy their needs. BMI using Electroencephalogram (EEG) receives the mental thoughts from brain and converts into control signals to activate the exterior communication appliances in the absence of biological channels. To design the BCI, we conduct our study with three normal male subjects, three normal female subjects and three ALS affected individuals from the age of 20-60 with three electrode systems for four tasks. One Dimensional Local Binary Patterns (LBP) technique was applied to reduce the digitally sampled features collected from nine subjects was treated with Grey wolf optimization Neural Network (GWONN) to classify the mentally composed words. Using these techniques, we compared the three types of subjects to identify the performances. The study proves that subjects from normal male categories performance was maximum compared with the other subjects. To assess the individual performance of the subject, we conducted the recognition accuracy test in offline mode. From the accuracy test also, we obtained the best performance from the normal male subjects compared with female and ALS subjects with an accuracy of 98.33 %, 95.00 % and 88.33 %. Finally our study concludes that patients with ALS attack need more training than that of the other subjects.

Although BCI software or platforms have continued to mature in other fields, little effort has been expended on neurofeedback applications. Hence, we present BrainKilter, a real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis platform based on a & x201C;4-tier layered model & x201D;. The purposes of BrainKilter are to improve portability and accessibility, allowing different users to choose various options to perform EEG processing, target stimulation-induction through a pipeline, and analyze data online, essentially, to design a protocol paradigm and applicable BCI technology for neurofeedback experiments. The data processing effectiveness and application value of BrainKilter were tested using multiple-parameter neurofeedback training, in which BrainKilter regulated the amplitude of mismatch negative (MMN) signals for healthy individuals. The proposed platform consists of a set of software modules for online protocol design and signal decoding that can be conveniently and efficiently integrated for neurofeedback design and training. The BrainKilter platform provides a truly easy-to-use environment for customizing the experimental paradigm and for optimizing the parameters of neurofeedback experiments for research and clinical neurofeedback applications using BCI technology.

We provide background information about the functioning of biological neurons, discussing the most important and commonly used mathematical neural models. Most relevant information processing techniques, learning algorithms, and applications of spiking neurons are described and discussed, focusing on feasibility and biological plausibility of the methods. Specifically, we describe in detail the functioning and organization of the latest version of a 3D spatio-temporal SNN-based data machine framework called NeuCube, as well as it's SNN-related submodules. All described submodules are accompanied with formal algorithmic formulations. The architecture is highly relevant for the analysis and interpretation of various types of spatio-temporal brain data (STBD), like EEG, NIRS, fMRI, but we highlight some of the recent both STBD- and non-STBD-based applications. Finally, we summarise and discuss some open research problems that can be addressed in the future. These include, but are not limited to: application in the area of EEG-based BCI through transfer learning; application in the area of affective computing through the extension of the NeuCube framework which would allow for a biologically plausible SNN-based integration of central and peripheral nervous system measures. Matlab implementation of the NeuCube's SNN-related module is available for research and teaching purposes.

However, whether the AD brain shows similar changes from a dynamic or cross-frequency view remains poorly explored. This paper provides an effective framework to investigate the properties of multiplex brain networks in AD considering inter-frequency and temporal dynamics. Using resting-state EEG signals, two types of multiplex networks were reconstructed separately considering the network interactions between different frequency bands or time points. We further applied multiplex network features to characterize functional integration and segregation of the cross-frequency or time-varying networks. Finally, machine learning methods were employed to evaluate the performance of multiplex-network-based indexes for detection of AD. Results revealed that the brain networks of AD patients are disrupted with reduced segregation particularly in the left occipital area for both cross-frequency and time-varying networks. However, the alteration of integration differs among brain regions and may show an increasing trend in the frontal area of AD brain. By combining the features of integration and segregation in time-varying networks, the best classification performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.5%. These findings suggest that our multiplex framework can be applied to explore functional integration and segregation of brain networks and characterize the abnormalities of brain function. This may shed new light on the brain network analysis and extend our understanding of brain function in patients with neurological diseases.

Recently, deep learning has been employed for the emotion classifications of BCI systems and compared to traditional classification methods improved results have been obtained. In this paper, a novel deep neural network is proposed for emotion classification using EEG systems, which combines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) together. In the proposed network, the features extracted by the CNN are first sent to SAE for encoding and decoding. Then the data with reduced redundancy are used as the input features of a DNN for classification task. The public datasets of DEAP and SEED are used for testing. Experimental results show that the proposed network is more effective than conventional CNN methods on the emotion recognitions. For the DEAP dataset, the highest recognition accuracies of 89.49% and 92.86% are achieved for valence and arousal, respectively. For the SEED dataset, however, the best recognition accuracy reaches 96.77%. By combining the CNN, SAE, and DNN and training them separately, the proposed network is shown as an efficient method with a faster convergence than the conventional CNN.

Seizure Freedom in Temporal Plus Epilepsy Surgery Following Stereo-Electroencephalography	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Temporal lobe epilepsy; Temporal lobectomy; Insula; Epilepsy surgery; Stereolectroencephalography; Temporal plus epilepsy	LOBE EPILEPSY; OPERATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; INSULAR CORTEX; PATTERNS	Background: "Temporal plus" epilepsy (TPE) is a term that is used when the epileptogenic zone (EZ) extends beyond the boundaries of the temporal lobe. Stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) has been essential to identify additional EZs in adjacent structures that might be part of the temporal lobe/limbic network. Objective: We present a small case series of temporal plus cases successfully identified by SEEG who were seizure-free after resective surgery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 156 patients who underwent SEEG in 5 years. Six cases had TPE and underwent anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) with additional extra-temporal resections. Results: Five cases had a focus on the right hemisphere and one on the left. Three cases were non-lesional and three were lesional. Mean follow-up time since surgery was 2.9 years (SD +/- 1.8). Three patients had subdural electrodes investigation prior or in addition to SEEG. All patients underwent standard ATL and additional extra-temporal resections during the same procedure or at a later date. All patients were seizure-free at their last follow-up appointment (Engel Ia = 3; Engel Ib = 2; Engel Ic = 1). Pathology was nonspecific/gliosis for all six cases. Conclusion: TPE might explain some of the failures in temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. We present a small case series of six patients in whom SEEG successfully identified this phenomenon and surgery proved effective.

The need to develop robust and generalised classifiers has been one of the vital requirements in BCI for real world application. EEGNet is a compact CNN model that had been reported to be generalised for different BCI paradigms. In this paper, we have aimed at further improving the EEGNet architecture by employing Neural Structured Learning (NSL) that taps into the relational information within the data to regularise the training of the neural network. This would allow the EEGNet to make better predictions while maintaining the structural similarity of the input. In addition to better performance, the combination of EEGNet and NSL is more robust, works well with smaller training samples and requires on separate feature engineering, thus saving the computational cost. The proposed approach had been tested on two standard motor imagery datasets: the first being a two-class motor imagery dataset from Graz University and the second is the 4-class Dataset 2a from BCI competition 2008. The accuracy has shown that our combined EEGNet an NSL approach is superior to the sole EEGNet model.

Evaluation of an Activity Tracker to Detect Seizures Using Machine Learning	JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article						seizure; detection; algorithm; epilepsy; activity	OPERATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; ILAE COMMISSION; POSITION PAPER; EPILEPSY; VALIDATION; DEVICES	Currently, the tracking of seizures is highly subjective, dependent on qualitative information provided by the patient and family instead of quantifiable seizure data. Usage of a seizure detection device to potentially detect seizure events in a population of epilepsy patients has been previously done. Therefore, we chose the Fitbit Charge 2 smart watch to determine if it could detect seizure events in patients when compared to continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring for those admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit. A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study that met the criteria between 2015 and 2016. All seizure types were recorded. Twelve patients had a total of 53 epileptic seizures. The patient-aggregated receiver operating characteristic curve had an area under the curve of 0.58 [0.56, 0.60], indicating that the neural network models were generally able to detect seizure events at an above-chance level. However, the overall low specificity implied a false alarm rate that would likely make the model unsuitable in practice. Overall, the use of the Fitbit Charge 2 activity tracker does not appear well suited in its current form to detect epileptic seizures in patients with seizure activity when compared to data recorded from the continuous EEG.

A human amygdala site that inhibits respiration and elicits apnea in pediatric epilepsy	JCI INSIGHT			English	Article							SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; BRAIN-STEM; PARABRACHIAL NUCLEUS; MEDULLA-OBLONGATA; STIMULATION; PROJECTIONS; MECHANISMS; SEIZURES; COMPLEX; CHILDHOOD	BACKGROUND. Seizure-induced inhibition of respiration plays a critical role in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). However, the mechanisms underlying seizure-induced central apnea in pediatric epilepsy are unknown. METHODS. We studied 8 pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing intracranial electroencephalography. We recorded respiration during seizures and during electrical stimulation mapping of 174 forebrain sites. A machine-learning algorithm was used to delineate brain regions that inhibit respiration. RESULTS. In 2 patients, apnea coincided with seizure spread to the amygdala. Supporting a role for the amygdala in breathing inhibition in children, electrically stimulating the amygdala produced apnea in all 8 subjects (3-17 years old). These effects did not depend on epilepsy type and were relatively specific to the amygdala, as no other site affected breathing. Remarkably, patients were unaware that they had stopped breathing, and none reported dyspnea or arousal, findings critical for SUDEP. Finally, a machine-learning algorithm based on 45 stimulation sites and 210 stimulation trials identified a focal subregion in the human amygdala that consistently produced apnea. This site, which we refer to as the amygdala inhibition of respiration (AIR) site includes the medial subregion of the basal nuclei, cortical and medial nuclei, amygdala transition areas, and intercalated neurons. CONCLUSIONS. A focal site in the amygdala inhibits respiration and induces apnea (AIR site) when electrically stimulated and during seizures in children with epilepsy. This site may prove valuable for determining those at greatest risk for SUDEP and as a therapeutic target. FUNDING.

It determines the course of clinical diagnosis and treatment, and its impact stretches beyond the clinical domain to epilepsy research and the development of novel therapies. Automated identification of seizure type may facilitate understanding of the disease, and seizure detection and prediction have been the focus of recent research that has sought to exploit the benefits of machine learning and deep learning architectures. Nevertheless, there is not yet a definitive solution for automating the classification of seizure type, a task that must currently be performed by an expert epileptologist. Inspired by recent advances in neural memory networks (NMNs), we introduce a novel approach for the classification of seizure type using electrophysiological data. We first explore the performance of traditional deep learning techniques which use convolutional and recurrent neural networks, and enhance these architectures by using external memory modules with trainable neural plasticity. We show that our model achieves a state-of-the-art weighted F1 score of 0.945 for seizure type classification on the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus with the IBM TUSZ preprocessed data. This work highlights the potential of neural memory networks to support the field of epilepsy research, along with biomedical research and signal analysis more broadly.

Disentangling the Independent Contributions of Visual and Conceptual Features to the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Scene Categorization	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						natural scenes; EEG; encoding; decoding	OBJECT RECOGNITION; NATURAL SCENES; REPRESENTATION; STATISTICS; COMPONENTS; DATABASE; SURFACE; CORTEX; PERCEPTION; SIGNATURES	Human scene categorization is characterized by its remarkable speed. While many visual and conceptual features have been linked to this ability, significant correlations exist between feature spaces, impeding our ability to determine their relative contributions to scene categorization. Here, we used a whitening transformation to decorrelate a variety of visual and conceptual features and assess the time course of their unique contributions to scene categorization. Participants (both sexes) viewed 2250 full colorscene images drawn from 30 different scene categories while having their brain activity measured through 256-channel EEG. We examined the variance explained at each electrode and time point of visual event related potential (vERP) data from nine different whitened encoding models. These ranged from low-level features obtained from filter outputs to high level conceptual features requiring human annotation. The amount of category information in the vERPs was assessed through multivariate decoding methods. Behavioral similarity measures were obtained in separate crowdsourced experiments. We found that all nine models together contributed 78% of the variance of human scene similarity assessments and were within the noise ceiling of the vERP data. Low-level models explained earlier vERP variability (88 ms after image onset), whereas high-level models explained later variance (169 ms). Critically, only high-level models shared vERP variability with behavior. Together, these results suggest that scene categorization is primarily a high-level process, but reliant on previously extracted low-level features.

However, this consensual approach might be tempered in the light of two ongoing transformations in sleep research: big data and artificial intelligence (AI). Method: We analyzed the PSG of 347 patients with chronic insomnia, including 59 with Sleep State Misperception (SSM) and 288 without (INS). 89 good sleepers (GS) were used as controls. PSGs were compared regarding: ( 1) macroscopic indexes derived from the hypnogram, (2) mesoscopic indexes extracted from the electroencephalographic (EEG) spectrum, (3) sleep microstructure (slow waves, spindles). We used supervised algorithms to differentiate patients from GS. Results: Macroscopic features illustrate the insomnia conundrum, with SSM patients displaying similar sleep metrics as GS, whereas INS patients show a deteriorated sleep. However, both SSM and INS patients showed marked differences in EEG spectral components (meso) compared to GS, with reduced power in the delta band and increased power in the theta/alpha, sigma and beta bands. INS and SSM patients showed decreased spectral slope in NREM. INS and SSM patients also differed from GS in sleep microstructure with fewer and slower slow waves and more and faster sleep spindles. Importantly, SSM and INS patients were almost indistinguishable at the meso and micro levels. Accordingly, unsupervised classifiers can reliably categorize insomnia patients and GS (Cohen's k = 0.87) but fail to tease apart SSM and INS patients when restricting classifiers to micro and meso features (k = 0.004).

The aim of this study was to assess the signal acquisition and the performance of the automatic sleep staging algorithms of a reduced-montage dry-electroencephalographic (EEG) device (Dreem headband, DH) compared to the gold-standard polysomnography (PSG) scored by five sleep experts. Methods: A total of 25 subjects who completed an overnight sleep study at a sleep center while wearing both a PSG and the DH simultaneously have been included in the analysis. We assessed (1) similarity of measured EEG brain waves between the DH and the PSG; (2) the heart rate, breathing frequency, and respiration rate variability (RRV) agreement between the DH and the PSG; and (3) the performance of the DH's automatic sleep staging according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines versus PSG sleep experts manual scoring. Results: The mean percentage error between the EEG signals acquired by the DH and those from the PSG for the monitoring of a was 15 +/- 3.5%, 16 +/- 4.3% for 13, 16 +/- 6.1% for lambda, and 10 +/- 1.4% for theta frequencies during sleep. The mean absolute error for heart rate, breathing frequency, and RRV was 1.2 +/- 0.5 bpm, 0.3 +/- 0.2 cpm, and 3.2 +/- 0.6%, respectively. Automatic sleep staging reached an overall accuracy of 83.5 +/- 6.4% (F1 score: 83.8 +/- 6.3) for the DH to be compared with an average of 86.4 +/- 8.0% (F1 score: 86.3 +/- 7.4) for the 5 sleep experts. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the capacity of the DH to both monitor sleep-related physiological signals and process them accurately into sleep stages. This device paves the way for, large-scale, longitudinal sleep studies.

Inducing these emotions and making an understanding from brain responses have huge practical significance. Music is a powerful tool to induce emotions, and the induced emotions are generally getting influenced by factors external to music such as familiarity. This work presents a novel study on the effect of familiarity on recognition of pleasant (positive) and unpleasant (negative) emotional states induced by Hindi music videos. For this, we recorded 32-channel EEG from six healthy subjects while they watched Hindi music videos and self-reported ratings of felt emotions on valence and familiarity scale. We used a machine learning framework for emotion classification from power spectral and functional connectivity features. The framework consists of SVD-QRcp and F-ratio based feature selection and an SVM classifier. The classification was performed under three cases of familiarity, namely, familiar, unfamiliar, and regardless of familiarity of the music videos. We found that for the familiar case, the classification performance was higher than unfamiliar and regardless of familiarity cases for all considered features. The best performing features were from the individual electrodes and these features were from the frontal and left parietal regions which indicate the lateralized processing of valence. In addition to classification, we analyzed the feature and electrode usage for all the cases of familiarity. It was found that the features from theta, alpha, and gamma band covering the frontal and parietal brain regions were dominantly involved.

The epileptogenic activity is also known to be suppressed by cognitive processing. However, differences between epileptic and healthy brain behavior during rest and task were not studied in detail. In this study we investigate the impact of cognitive processing on epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic hippocampus and the intracranial EEG features representing the underlying electrophysiological processes. We investigated intracranial EEG in 24 epileptic and 24 non-epileptic hippocampi in patients with intractable focal epilepsy during a resting state period and during performance of various cognitive tasks. We evaluated the behavior of features derived from high frequency oscillations, interictal epileptiform discharges and functional connectivity and their changes in relation to cognitive processing. Subsequently, we performed an analysis whether cognitive processing can contribute to classification of epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampus using a machine learning approach. The results show that cognitive processing suppresses epileptogenic activity in epileptic hippocampus while it causes a shift toward higher frequencies in non-epileptic hippocampus. Statistical analysis reveals significantly different electrophysiological reactions of epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampus during cognitive processing, which can be measured by high frequency oscillations, interictal epileptiform discharges and functional connectivity. The calculated features showed high classification potential for epileptic hippocampus (AUC = 0.93). In conclusion, the differences between epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampus during cognitive processing bring new insight in delineation between pathological and physiological processes. Analysis of computed iEEG features in rest and task condition can improve the functional mapping during pre-surgical evaluation and provide additional guidance for distinguishing between epileptic and non-epileptic structure which is absolutely crucial for achieving the best possible outcome with as little side effects as possible.

Amplitude of high frequency oscillations as a biomarker of the seizure onset zone	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Automated detection algorithm; Epilepsy; Machine learning; Ripple; Localization	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; EPILEPSY SURGERY; FAST RIPPLES; SCALP EEG; 80-500 HZ; RESECTION; MACROELECTRODES; TIME	Objective: Studies of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in epilepsy have primarily tested the HFO rate as a biomarker of the seizure onset zone (SOZ), but the rate varies over time and is not robust for all individual subjects. As an alternative, we tested the performance of HFO amplitude as a potential SOZ biomarker using two automated detection algorithms. Method: HFOs were detected in intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) from 11 patients using a machine learning algorithm and a standard amplitude-based algorithm. For each detector, SOZ and non-SOZ channels were classified using the rate and amplitude of high frequency events, and performance was compared using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: The amplitude of detected events was significantly higher in SOZ. Across subjects, amplitude more accurately classified SOZ/non-SOZ than rate (higher values of area under the ROC curve and sensitivity, and lower false positive rates). Moreover, amplitude was more consistent across segments of data, indicated by lower coefficient of variation. Conclusion: As an SOZ biomarker, HFO amplitude offers advantages over HFO rate: it exhibits higher classification accuracy, more consistency over time, and robustness to parameter changes. Significance: This biomarker has the potential to increase the generalizability of HFOs and facilitate clinical implementation as a tool for SOZ localization.

However, the difficulties in performing imagery tasks limit its application. To overcome the limitation, an enhanced MI-BCI based on functional electrical stimulation (FES) and virtual reality (VR) is proposed in this study. On one hand, the FES is used to stimulate the subjects' lower limbs before their imagination to make them experience the muscles' contraction and improve their attention on the lower limbs, by which it is supposed that the subjects' motor imagery (MI) abilities can be enhanced. On the other hand, a ball-kicking movement scenario from the first-person perspective is designed to provide visual guidance for performing MI tasks. The combination of FES and VR can be used to reduce the difficulties in performing MI tasks and improve classification accuracy. Finally, the comparison experiments were conducted on twelve healthy subjects to validate the performance of the enhanced MI-BCI. The results show that the classification performance can be improved significantly by using the proposed MI-BCI in terms of the classification accuracy (ACC), the area under the curve (AUC) and the F1 score (paired t-test, p <0.05).

J	Zhu, TQ; Luo, W; Yu, F				Zhu, Tianqi; Luo, Wei; Yu, Feng			Multi-Branch Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Sleep Stage Classification with Embedded Stage Refinement and Residual Attention Channel Fusion	SENSORS			English	Article						sleep stage scoring; neural network-based refinement; residual attention	EEG; MODEL	Automatic sleep stage classification of multi-channel sleep signals can help clinicians efficiently evaluate an individual's sleep quality and assist in diagnosing a possible sleep disorder. To obtain accurate sleep classification results, the processing flow of results from signal preprocessing and machine-learning-based classification is typically employed. These classification results are refined based on sleep transition rules. Neural networks-i.e., machine learning algorithms-are powerful at solving classification problems. Some methods apply them to the first two processes above; however, the refinement process continues to be based on traditional methods. In this study, the sleep stage refinement process was incorporated into the neural network model to form real end-to-end processing. In addition, for multi-channel signals, the multi-branch convolutional neural network was combined with a proposed residual attention method. This approach further improved the model classification accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (Sleep-EDFx) and University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database (UCDDB). It achieved respective accuracy rates of 85.7% and 79.4%. The results also showed that sleep stage refinement based on a neural network is more effective than the traditional refinement method. Moreover, the proposed residual attention method was determined to have a more robust channel-information fusion ability than the respective average and concatenation methods.

Another solution is behavioural treatment that does not seem to present better results than medication for a higher cost. A novel method with growing interest is the use of neurofeedback (NF) to teach the patient to self-regulate symptoms by herself, through the visualisation of the brain activity in an understandable form. Moreover, virtual reality (VR) is a supportive environment for NF in the context of ADHD. However, before proceeding the NF, it is important to determine the features of the physiological signals corresponding to the symptoms' appearance. We present here a novel framework based on the joint measurement of electroencephalogram (EEG) and sight direction by equipment that can be embedded in VR headset, the goals being to estimate attentional state. In parallel to the signal acquisition, attentional tasks are performed to label the physiological signals. Features have been extracted from the signals and machine learning (ML) models have been applied to retrieve the attentional state. Encouraging results have been provided from the pilot study with the ability to make the right classification in multiple scenarios. Moreover, a dataset with the labelled physiological signals is under development. It will help to have a better understanding of the mechanism behind ADHD symptoms.

There is a need for innovative methods to assess user perceived Quality of Experience (QoE), as a proxy for consumer satisfaction with such systems and services. Users emotional state plays a key role in QoE; thus, it is necessary to consider it in user experience evaluation and the design process of stereoscopic 3D video content. In the present article we introduce the use of a specially designed model based on a feedforward Multilayer Perception Artificial Neural Network as an appropriate Machine Learning technique for the estimation of human emotional state while viewing various categories of stereoscopic 3D video content. The goal is to design an emotional state estimator based on direct psychophysiological measurements. The considered psychophysiological signals include heart rate (HR) calculated from an echocardiogram (ECG), electro-dermal activity (EDA), and brain activity (BA) in EEG signals. Participants watched a series of 3D video contents varying in terms of visual quality, while the mentioned psychophysiological signals were recorded, and self-reported subjectively experienced emotions using a Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) questionnaire. The obtained results show that it is possible to construct such a highly precise estimator of emotional states.

We believe that technology can challenge this notion through the design of neuroresponsive systems for interpersonal communication. We explore this through "Neo-Noumena", a communicative neuroresponsive system that uses brain-computer interfacing and artificial intelligence to read one's emotional states and dynamically represent them to others in mixed reality through two head-mounted displays. In our study five participant pairs were given Neo-Noumena for three days, using the system freely. Measures of emotional competence demonstrated a statistically significant increase in participants' ability to interpersonally regulate emotions. Furthermore, participant interviews revealed themes regarding Spatiotemporal Actualization, Objective Representation, and Preternatural Transmission. We also suggest design strategies for future augmented emotion communication systems. We intend that work to give guidance towards a future in which our ability to interpersonally communicate emotion is augmented beyond traditional experience.

The terminal is a wearable front end in a 'machine learning-based sleep assist system', and is mainly composed of a sleep assist module, an ARM core control board, a WIFI module, a brain wave signal acquisition front end, and a power module. The design of the wearable front end proposed in this article innovatively uses bone conduction oscillators to play white noise and pink noise to aid sleep, and uses LED strips to gently wake up. After practical design, production and testing, the wearable front end proposed in this article can assist people with sleep disorders to better sleep. At the same time, the wearing front has been recognized by actual users and professional physicians, and has certain application value and promotion prospects.

Specifically, probabilistic information at critical points in time (so-called checkpoints) has been suggested to be sampled in order to evaluate the internal model, particularly in uncertain contexts. This way, initial model-based expectations are iteratively reaffirmed under uncertainty, even in the absence of prediction errors. Using electroencephalography (EEG), the present study aimed to investigate the interplay of such global uncertainty information and local adjustment cues prompting on-line adjustments of expectations. Within a stream of single digits, participants were to detect ordered sequences (i.e., 3-4-5-6-7) that had a regular length of five digits and were occasionally extended to seven digits. Over time, these extensions were either rare (low irreducible uncertainty) or frequent (high uncertainty) and could be unexpected or indicated by incidental colour cues. Accounting for cue information, an N400 component was revealed as the correlate of locally unexpected (vs expected) outcomes, reflecting effortful integration of incongruous information. As for model-compliant information, multivariate pattern decoding within the P3b time frame demonstrated effective exploitation of local (adjustment cues vs non-informative analogues) and global information (high vs low uncertainty regular endings) sampled from probabilistic events. Finally, superior fit of a global model (disregarding local adjustments) compared to a local model (including local adjustments) in a representational similarity analysis underscored the precedence of global reference frames in hierarchical predictive processing. Overall, results suggest that just like error-induced model adaptation, model evaluation is not limited to either local or global information. Following the hierarchical organisation of predictive processing, model evaluation too can occur at several levels of the processing hierarchy.

The high-frequency oscillation (HFOs) mode in MEG signal can now be used to detect lesions. Due to the time-consuming and error-prone operation of HFOs detection, an automatic HFOs detector with high accuracy is very necessary in modern medicine. Therefore, an optimized capsule neural network was used, and a MEG (magnetoencephalograph) HFOs detector based on MEGNet was proposed to facilitate the clinical detection of HFOs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a neural network has been used to detect HFOs in MEG. After optimized configuration, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed detector reached 94%, 95%, 94%, and 94%, which were better than other classical machine learning models. In addition, we used the k-fold cross-validation scheme to test the performance consistency of the model. The distribution of various performance indicators shows that our model is robust.

Recently, researchers have proposed various methods for feature extraction and classification based on MI signals. The decoding model based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted significant attention in the field of MI signal processing. Due to the strict requirements for subjects and experimental environments, it is difficult to collect large-scale and high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, the performance of a deep learning model depends directly on the size of the datasets. Therefore, the decoding of MI-EEG signals based on a DNN has proven highly challenging in practice. Based on this, we investigated the performance of different data augmentation (DA) methods for the classification of MI data using a DNN. First, we transformed the time series signals into spectrogram images using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Then, we evaluated and compared the performance of different DA methods for this spectrogram data. Next, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the MI signals and compared the classification performance of after DA. The Frechet inception distance (FID) was used to evaluate the quality of the generated data (GD) and the classification accuracy, and mean kappa values were used to explore the best CNN-DA method. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and pairedt-tests were used to assess the significance of the results. The results showed that the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) provided better augmentation performance than traditional DA methods: geometric transformation (GT), autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE) (p< 0.01). Public datasets of the BCI competition IV (datasets 1 and 2b) were used to verify the classification performance. Improvements in the classification accuracies of 17% and 21% (p< 0.01) were observed after DA for the two datasets. In addition, the hybrid network CNN-DCGAN outperformed the other classification methods, with average kappa values of 0.564 and 0.677 for the two datasets.

However, how the brain networks and their topological properties evolve over time during transient feedback-related cognition processing in SZ patients has not been investigated so far. In this paper, using publicly available feedback-related ERP data which were recorded from SZ patients and healthy controls (HC) when they performed a reinforcement learning task, we carried out an event-related network analysis where topology of brain functional networks was characterized with some graph measures including clustering coefficient (C), global efficiency (E-global) and local efficiency (E-local) on a millisecond timescale. Our results showed that the brain functional networks displayed rapid rearrangements of topological properties during transient feedback-related cognition process for both two groups. More importantly, we found that SZ patients exhibited significantly reduced theta-band (time window of 170-350 ms after stimuli onset) brain functional connectivity strength, E-global, E-local and C in response to negative feedback stimuli compared to HC group. The network based statistic (NBS) analysis detected one significantly decreased theta-band subnetwork in SZ patients mainly involving in frontal-occipital and temporal-occipital connections compared to HC group. In addition, clozapine treatment seemed to greatly reduce theta-band power and topological measures of brain networks in SZ patients. Finally, the theta-band power, graph measures and functional connectivity were extracted to train a support vector machine classifier for classification of HC from SZ, or Cloz + SZ or Cloz- SZ, and a relatively good classification accuracy of 84.48%, 89.47% and 78.26% was obtained, respectively. The above results suggested a less optimal organization of theta-band brain network in SZ patients, and studying the topological parameters of brain networks evolve over time during transient feedback-related processing could be useful for understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying reinforcement learning deficits in SZ patients.

There is a need for a fast and integrated neural investigation process that could help epileptologist to determine and diagnose the patients as soon as possible. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been commonly used to diagnose patients by investigating the brain's electrical activity that might be related to epilepsy. The proposed framework consists of several algorithms of feature extraction (current maxima, lower threshold, and target point selection), pattern matching (segment and domain matching) and post-processing with power, energy features. Maxima, homogeneity, power, energy and physiological field features have been used in this proposed model. Moreover, specific brain regions (lobes) inside the brain, where the seizure occurs, has been identified by the domain matching algorithm. There exist no such seizure detection system which provides warning message from the pre-ictal phase. This proposed model can be efficiently used as a real-time patient monitoring system which can send a warning message to the patient before the occurrence of seizure. This ultimately helps doctors for taking necessary actions. True positive rate (TPR) of 91.07% and 97.36% has been recorded for seizure and normal classes respectively. The accuracy and F-1 score of the proposed model are 92.66% and 94.86%, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Samanta, D				Samanta, Debopam			Recent Advances in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Neonatal Seizures	NEUROPEDIATRICS			English	Review						neonatal seizures; epilepsy; amplitude-integrated EEG; treatment; phenobarbital; levetiracetam	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; 1ST-LINE TREATMENT; INTRAVENOUS LEVETIRACETAM; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; FULL-TERM; EEG; EFFICACY; SAFETY; EPILEPSIES; MANAGEMENT	Seizures are the most common neurological emergency in the neonates, and this age group has the highest incidence of seizures compared with any other period of life. The author provides a narrative review of recent advances in the genetics of neonatal epilepsies, new neonatal seizure classification system, diagnostics, and treatment of neonatal seizures based on a comprehensive literature review (MEDLINE using PubMED and OvidSP vendors with appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence), personal practice, and experience. Knowledge regarding various systemic and postzygotic genetic mutations responsible for neonatal epilepsy has been exploded in recent times, as well as better delineation of clinical phenotypes associated with rare neonatal epilepsies. An International League Against Epilepsy task force on neonatal seizure has proposed a new neonatal seizure classification system and also evaluated the specificity of semiological features related to particular etiology. Although continuous video electroencephalogram (EEG) is the gold standard for monitoring neonatal seizures, amplitude-integrated EEGs have gained significant popularity in resource-limited settings. There is tremendous progress in the automated seizure detection algorithm, including the availability of a fully convolutional neural network using artificial machine learning (deep learning). There is a substantial need for ongoing research and clinical trials to understand optimal medication selection (first line, second line, and third line) for neonatal seizures, treatment duration of antiepileptic drugs after cessation of seizures, and strategies to improve neuromorbidities such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and developmental impairments. Although in recent times, levetiracetam use has been significantly increased for neonatal seizures, a multicenter, randomized, blinded, controlled phase IIb trial confirmed the superiority of phenobarbital over levetiracetam in the acute suppression of neonatal seizures. While there is no single best choice available for the management of neonatal seizures, institutional guidelines should be formed based on a consensus of local experts to mitigate wide variability in the treatment and to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.

Semi-supervised training data selection improves seizure forecasting in canines with epilepsy	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Hierarchical clustering; Machine learning; Seizure forecasting	LONG-TERM; PREDICTION; RECORDINGS; BURSTS	Objective: Conventional selection of pre-ictal EEG epochs for seizure prediction algorithm training data typically assumes a continuous pre-ictal brain state preceding a seizure. This is carried out by defining a fixed duration, pre-ictal time period before seizures from which pre-ictal training data epochs are uniformly sampled. However, stochastic physiological and pathological fluctuations in EEG data characteristics and underlying brain states suggest that pre-ictal state dynamics may be more complex, and selection of pre-ictal training data segments to reflect this could improve algorithm performance. Methods: We propose a semi-supervised technique to select pre-ictal training data most distinguishable from interictal EEG according to pre-specified data characteristics. The proposed method uses hierarchical clustering to identify optimal pre-ictal data epochs. Results: In this paper we compare the performance of a seizure forecasting algorithm with and without hierarchical clustering of pre-ictal periods in chronic iEEG recordings from six canines with naturally occurring epilepsy. Hierarchical clustering of training data improved results for Time In Warning (TIW) (0.18 vs. 0.23) and False Positive Rate (FPR) (0.5 vs. 0.59) when evaluated across all subjects (p<0.001, n=6). Results were mixed when evaluating TIW, FPR, and Sensitivity for individual dogs. Conclusion: Hierarchical clustering is a helpful method for training data selection overall, but should be evaluated on a subject-wise basis. Significance: The clustering method can be used to optimize results of forecasting towards sensitivity or TIW or FPR, and therefore can be useful for epilepsy management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Connectivity dynamics from wakefulness to sleep	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS; NETWORKS; FLUCTUATIONS; FREQUENCY; PATTERNS	Interest in time-resolved connectivity in fMRI has grown rapidly in recent years. The most widely used technique for studying connectivity changes over time utilizes a sliding windows approach. There has been some debate about the utility of shorter versus longer windows, the use of fixed versus adaptive windows, as well as whether observed resting state dynamics during wakefulness may be predominantly due to changes in sleep state and subject head motion. In this work we use an independent component analysis (ICA)-based pipeline applied to concurrent EEG/fMRI data collected during wakefulness and various sleep stages and show: 1) connectivity states obtained from clustering sliding windowed correlations of resting state functional network time courses well classify the sleep states obtained from EEG data, 2) using shorter sliding windows instead of longer non-overlapping windows improves the ability to capture transition dynamics even at windows as short as 30 s, 3) motion appears to be mostly associated with one of the states rather than spread across all of them 4) a fixed tapered sliding window approach outperforms an adaptive dynamic conditional correlation approach, and 5) consistent with prior EEG/fMRI work, we identify evidence of multiple states within the wakeful condition which are able to be classified with high accuracy. Classification of wakeful only states suggest the presence of time-varying changes in connectivity in fMRI data beyond sleep state or motion. Results also inform about advantageous technical choices, and the identification of different clusters within wakefulness that are separable suggest further studies in this direction.

However, most RL algorithms struggle to learn in this setting since the learning signal is mostly zeros. In contrast, humans are good at assessing and predicting the future consequences of actions and can serve as good reward/policy shapers to accelerate the robot learning process. Previous works have shown that the human brain generates an error-related signal, measurable using electroencephelography (EEG), when the human perceives the task being done erroneously. In this work, we propose a method that uses evaluative feedback obtained from human brain signals measured via scalp EEG to accelerate RL for robotic agents in sparse reward settings. As the robot learns the task, the EEG of a human observer watching the robot attempts is recorded and decoded into noisy error feedback signal. From this feedback, we use supervised learning to obtain a policy that subsequently augments the behavior policy and guides exploration in the early stages of RL. This bootstraps the RL learning process to enable learning from sparse reward. Using a simple robotic navigation task as a test bed, we show that our method achieves a stable obstacle-avoidance policy with high success rate, outperforming learning from sparse rewards only that struggles to achieve obstacle avoidance behavior or fails to advance to the goal.

Selective Enhancement of Object Representations through Multisensory Integration	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						decoding; EEG; multisensory integration; object recognition; representational similarity analysis	DISCRIMINATION; CATEGORIZATION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; ATTENTION; DEFICITS; SINGLE; CORTEX; SPACE; TIME	Objects are the fundamental building blocks of how we create a representation of the external world. One major distinction among objects is between those that are animate versus those that are inanimate. In addition, many objects are specified by more than a single sense, yet the nature by which multisensory objects are represented by the brain remains poorly understood. Using representational similarity analysis of male and female human EEG signals, we show enhanced encoding of audiovisual objects when compared with their corresponding visual and auditory objects. Surprisingly, we discovered that the often-found processing advantages for animate objects were not evident under multisensory conditions. This was due to a greater neural enhancement of inanimate objects-which are more weakly encoded under unisensory conditions. Further analysis showed that the selective enhancement of inanimate audiovisual objects corresponded with an increase in shared representations across brain areas, suggesting that the enhancement was mediated by multisensory integration. Moreover, a distance-to-bound analysis provided critical links between neural findings and behavior. Improvements in neural decoding at the individual exemplar level for audiovisual inanimate objects predicted reaction time differences between multisensory and unisensory presentations during a Go/No-Go animate categorization task. Links between neural activity and behavioral measures were most evident at intervals of 100-200 ms and 350-500 ms after stimulus presentation, corresponding to time periods associated with sensory evidence accumulation and decision-making, respectively. Collectively, these findings provide key insights into a fundamental process the brain uses to maximize the information it captures across sensory systems to perform object recognition.

Even though some well-known features of motor-related electroencephalograms have been revealed using traditionally applied methods, they still lack a robust classification of motor-related patterns. Here, we introduce new features of motor-related brain activity and uncover hidden mechanisms of the underlying neuronal dynamics by considering event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu-rhythm in the sensorimotor cortex, i.e., tracking the decrease of the power spectral density in the corresponding frequency band. We hypothesize that motor-related ERD is associated with the suppression of random fluctuations of mu-band neuronal activity. This is due to the lowering of the number of active neuronal populations involved in the corresponding oscillation mode. In this case, we expect more regular dynamics and a decrease in complexity of the EEG signal recorded over the sensorimotor cortex. In order to support this, we apply measures of signal complexity by means of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). In particular, we demonstrate that certain RQA quantifiers are very useful to detect the moment of movement onset and, therefore, are able to classify the laterality of executed movements.

J	Jochumsen, M; Niazi, IK				Jochumsen, Mads; Niazi, Imran Khan			Detection and classification of single-trial movement-related cortical potentials associated with functional lower limb movements	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						movement intention; movement-related cortical potential; brain-computer interface; neurorehabilitation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; HUMAN VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; TREADMILL WALKING; INTENTION	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces that activate exoskeletons based on decoded movement-related activity have been shown to be useful for stroke rehabilitation. With the advances in the development of exoskeletons it is possible to replicate a number of different functional movements that are relevant to rehabilitate after stroke. In this study, the aim is to detect and classify six different movement tasks of the lower extremities that are used in the activities of daily living.Approach. Thirteen healthy subjects performed six movement tasks (1) Stand-to-sit, (2) Sit-to-stand, (3) Walking, (4) Step up, (5) Side step, and (6) Back step. Each movement task was performed 50 times while continuous EEG was recorded. The continuous EEG was divided into epochs containing the movement intention associated with the movements, and idle activity was obtained from recordings during rest. Temporal, spectral and template matching features were extracted from the EEG channels covering the motor cortex and classified using Random Forest in two ways: (1) movement intention vs. idle activity (estimate of movement intention detection), and (2) classification of movement types.Main results. The classification accuracies associated with movement intention detection were in the range of 80%-90%, while 54 +/- 3% of all movement types were classified correctly. The stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand tasks were easiest to classify, while step up often was classified as walking.Significance. The results indicate that it is possible to detect and classify functional movements of the lower extremities from single-trial EEG. This may be implemented in a brain-computer interface that can control an exoskeleton and be used for neurorehabilitation.

Machine learning based approaches for classification of brain activities do not reveal the underlying dynamics of the human brain. Methods: Since eigen decomposition has been found useful in a variety of applications, we conjecture that change of brain states would manifest in terms of changes in the invariant spaces spanned by eigen vectors as well as amount of variance along them. Based on this, our first approach is to track the brain state transitions by analysing invariant space variations over time. Whereas, our second approach analyses sub-band characteristic response vector formed using eigen values along with the eigen vectors to capture the dynamics. Result: We have taken two real time EEG datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of proposed approaches. It has been observed that in case of unimodal experiment, invariant spaces explicitly show the transitions of brain states. Whereas sub-band characteristic response vector approach gives better performance in the case of cross-modal conditions. Conclusions: Evolution of invariant spaces along with the eigen values may help in understanding and tracking the brain state transitions. Significance: The proposed approaches can track the activity transitions in real time. They do not require any training dataset.

It is often accompanied by a lack of emotional responsiveness and sometimes memory fragmentation. Studies haze shown the temporary occurrence of this condition among 34-70% of the general population during their life span. However, if the symptoms become consistent, they can be intolerable and can profoundly affect the quality of life in such an extent that it would be considered as one type of the dissociative disorders, depersonalisation disorder (DPD). Currently, there is no laboratory method to diagnose DPD, and studies have expressed a period of seven to 12 years for the correct diagnosis of DPD. We recently aimed to investigate DPD and its symptoms based on inexpensive and convenient electroencephalogram (EEG) neuroimaging technique, using calculation of event-related-potentials (ERPs) over the somatosensory cortex. We showed that DPD symptoms could he as a result of impairment in early (implicit) stages of information processing in the brain. We also introduced P45 as a potential electrophysiological biomarker to study DPD. In this paper, we first replicated our results and then used P45 as a feature to discriminate between individuals with high and low tendency to DPD symptoms. We used Continuous Dynamic Time Warping (CDTW) to address the possible time shift and distortion in the ERP signals and to reach better classification performance. We reached 85% accuracy (Kappa 0.7) using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, which confirms the feasibility for discrimination between DPD patients and a control group using EEG signals.

We implemented the SSCOR-based method in accordance with their descriptions and estimated its classification accuracy using a benchmark SSVEP dataset with cross validation. Our results showed significantly lower classification accuracy compared with the ones reported in Kumar et al.'s study. We further investigated the sources of performance discrepancy by simulating data leakage between training and test datasets. The classification performance of the simulation was remarkably similar to those reported by Kumar et al.. We, therefore, question the validity of evaluation and conclusions drawn in Kumar et al.'s study.

Methods: A retrospective and descriptive study was conducted of a series of patients diagnosed with WS who developed LGS seen at Hospital de Pediattia Prof. Dr. JP Garrahan between January 2012 and January 2019. The medical charts of 170 patients with WS were analyzed. In 63 (37 %) of the children WS evolved to LGS. Results: During the transition from WS to LGS four well-defined electroclinical patterns were recognized. The first corresponded to a group of patients with multiple seizure types, including epileptic spasms associated with multifocal paroxysms; the electroclinical pattern in second group showed mainly focal seizures associated with focal discharges in the EEG; the third group showed predominance of epileptic spasms and myoclonic seizures associated with diffuse spike-and-wave and polyspike-and-wave paroxysms; and the remaining group was characterized by a mixed electroclinical pattern including features of the other three groups. All patients had a neuropsychological deficit. Worsening of cognition and behavior was observed during the transition period in 11, 8, and 5 patients of groups 1, 3, and 4, respectively. Conclusion: Our study of the transition period from WS to LGS allowed us to recognize four well-defined electroclinical patterns. The early recognition of the different patterns could, in the future, support a more precocious prognostic evaluation.

However, there are many similarities between selected features. New method: To reduce the redundant features, we applied a technique employing FDR in conjunction with feature correlation. We performed an attention network test on schizophrenic patients and normal subjects with a 152-channel magnetoencephalograph. P300m amplitudes of event-related fields (ERFs) were used as features at the sensor level and P300m amplitudes of ERFs for 500 nodes on the cortex surface were used as features at the source level. Features were ranked using FDR criterion and cross-correlation measure, and then the highest ranked 10 features were selected and an exhaustive search was used to find combination having the maximum accuracy. Results: At the sensor level, we found a single channel of the occipital region that distinguished the two groups with an accuracy of 89.7 %. At source level, we obtained an accuracy of 96.2 % using two features, the left superior frontal region and the left inferior temporal region. Comparison with existing method: At source level, we obtained a higher accuracy than traditional method using only FDR criterion (accuracy = 88.5 %). We used only the P300 m amplitude (not latency) on a single channel and two brain regions at a fairly high rate.

However, we observe that the attention based knowledge retrieval mechanisms used in current NMNs restrict them from achieving their full potential as the attention process retrieves information based on a set of static connection weights. This is suboptimal in a setting where there are vast differences among samples in the data domain; such as anomaly detection where there is no consistent criteria for what constitutes an anomaly. In this paper, we propose a plastic neural memory access mechanism which exploits both static and dynamic connection weights in the memory read, write and output generation procedures. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed memory model in three challenging anomaly detection tasks in the medical domain: abnormal EEG identification, MRI tumour type classification and schizophrenia risk detection in children. In all settings, the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis demonstrating the utility of neural plasticity for the knowledge retrieval process and provide evidence on how the proposed memory model generates sparse yet informative memory outputs.

These measurements have an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and iEEG signals have often been used to decode brain activity or drive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). iEEG recordings are typically done for seizure monitoring in epilepsy patients who have these electrodes placed for a clinical purpose: to localize both brain regions that are essential for function and others where seizures start. Brain regions not involved in epilepsy are thought to function normally and provide a unique opportunity to learn about human neurophysiology. Intracranial electrodes measure the aggregate activity of large neuronal populations and recorded signals contain many features. Different features are extracted by analyzing these signals in the time and frequency domain. The time domain may reveal an evoked potential at a particular time after the onset of an event. Decomposition into the frequency domain may show narrowband peaks in the spectrum at specific frequencies or broadband signal changes that span a wide range of frequencies. Broadband power increases are generally observed when a brain region is active while most other features are highly specific to brain regions, inputs, and tasks. Here we describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of several iEEG signals that have often been used to decode brain activity and drive BCIs.

With recent developments in hardware technology, the use of inertial sensors allows researchers to effectively capture the human motion data for gait analysis. To this end, the aim of this paper is to identify emotions from the inertial signals of human gait recorded by means of body mounted smartphones. We extracted a manually-crafted set of features computed from the human inertial gait data which are used to train and precisely predict the human emotions. Specifically, we collected the inertial gait data of 40 volunteers by means of smartphone's on-board inertial measurement units (3D accelerometer, 3D gyroscope) attached at the chest in six basic emotions including sad, happy, anger, surprise, disgust and fear. Using stride based segmentation, the raw signals are first decomposed into individual strides. For each stride, a set of 296 spectro-temporal features are computed, which are fed into two supervised learning predictors namely Support Vector Machines and Random Forest. The classification results obtained with the proposed methodology and validated with k-fold validation procedure show classification accuracy of 95% for binary emotions and 86% for all six categories of emotions.

Several studies have utilized state of the art deep learning methods and combined physiological signals, such as the electrocardiogram (EEG), electroencephalogram (ECG), skin temperature, along with facial expressions, voice, posture to name a few, in order to classify emotions. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent the third generation of neural networks and employ biologically plausible models of neurons. SNNs have been shown to handle Spatio-temporal data, which is essentially the nature of the data encountered in emotion recognition problem, in an efficient manner. In this work, for the first time, we propose the application of SNNs in order to solve the emotion recognition problem with the multimodal dataset. Specifically, we use the NeuCube framework, which employs an evolving SNN architecture to classify emotional valence and evaluate the performance of our approach on the MAHNOB-HCI dataset. The multimodal data used in our work consists of facial expressions along with physiological signals such as ECG, skin temperature, skin conductance, respiration signal, mouth length, and pupil size. We perform classification under the Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation mode. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 73.15% for classifying binary valence when applying feature-level fusion, which is comparable to other deep learning methods. We achieve this accuracy even without using EEG, which other deep learning methods have relied on to achieve this level of accuracy. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the SNN can be successfully used for solving the emotion recognition problem with multimodal data and also provide directions for future research utilizing SNN for Affective computing.

The healthy operation of the bearings directly affects the performance of the rotating machines. Bearing faults may cause more vibration than normal in rotating machines, which wastes power. However, further bearing failures can cause vital damage to rotating machines. In this study, bearing vibration values are obtained through a special test setup. Different types and different sizes of artificial faults have been created in the bearings for the testing process. Data on these bearings are collected at different speeds. The purpose of the study is to diagnose faults in the bearings. In this context, a new approach is proposed. First, the one-dimensional local binary pattern (1D-LBP) method is applied to vibration signals, and all signal data are carried to the 1D-LBP plane. Statistical features are obtained from the signals in the 1D-LBP plane by using these features, and then the vibrational signals are classified by the gray relational analysis (GRA) model. Four different data sets are organized to test the proposed approach. The results of the test process with this proposed model have an accuracy of 99.044% for Dataset1 (different speed -300 rpm intervals), 94.224% for Dataset2 (different speed -60 rpm intervals), and 99.584% for Dataset3 (fault size (mm)); a 100% average success rate is observed for Dataset4 (fault type - error free bearing (EFB), inner ring fault (IRF), outer ring fault (ORF), and ball fault (BF)).

To assess the complexity of complex-valued signal, a new entropy called complex-valued distribution entropy (CVDistEn) was first proposed in this study. Two rules, namely equal width criterion and equal area criterion, were employed to demarcate the complex-valued space and two kinds of CVDistEn, i.e., CVDistEn1 and CVDistEn2 were raised. Furthermore, two novel feature extraction methods: (1) flexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT)-based CVDistEn1 and logarithmic energy (LE) (FAWTC1L), (2) FAWT-based CVDistEn2 and LE (FAWTC2L) were subsequently put forward to characterize the interictal and ictal EEGs. Fuzzy k-nearest neighbors (FKNN) classifier was finally employed to classify these two types of EEGs automatically. Experiment results show the fusion method of FAWTC1L and FKNN leads to the best accuracies (ACCs)/Matthews correlation coefficients (MCCs) of 99.99%/99.97% and 100%/100% for Bonn and Neurology & Sleep Centre EEG datasets, respectively, while the other fusion scheme of FAWTC2L and FKNN results in the highest ACCs/MCCs of 99.97%/99.93% and 99.94%/99.89% for the same datasets. The proposed methods outperform other entropy-related seizure detection schemes and most of state-of-the-art techniques, they provide another new way for automated seizure detection in EEG.

A Simple but Efficient EEG Data Compression Algorithm for Neuromorphic Applications	IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH			English	Article						Integer fraction coder (IFC); Integer fraction decoder (IFD); Feature scale (FS); Pseudo integer (PI)	LOSSLESS COMPRESSION; COMPONENTS; IMAGE	Widespread use of Multichannel Electroencephalograph (MCEEG) in diversified fields ranging from clinical studies to Brain Computer Interface (BCI) application, has put in a lot of thrust in data processing concepts, for effective storage and transmission. The paper proposes a computationally simple and novel methodology Normalized Spatial Pseudo Codec (n-SPC) to compress MCEEG signals. The signals are first normalized followed by two operations namely the spatial coding and pseudo coding operating on integer part and fractional part of the normalized data respectively. The proposed method was evaluated on publicly available EEG databases and results indicate that the algorithm exhibits good storage efficiency with average Compression Ratio (CR) of 4.61 with a computational complexity of only O(zN). The algorithm offers significantly a better decompressed signal quality, quantified by average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 21.42 dB. The average encoding and decoding time per sample is 0.3 and 0.04 ms, respectively with an average Percentage Root Mean Square Deviation (PRD) of 5.33. The efficacy was further evaluated using the decompressed signal to detect sleep spindle, from an excerpt of EEG recording and was compared with the visual scoring of two experts, available at the DREAMS Sleep Spindles Database. Hence, the proposed compression scheme can be used in practical MCEEG recording, archiving and BCI and neuromorphic systems.

PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Local field potential; Partial least square; Linear and nonlinear Kalman filters; Whitening transform; Stationary wavelet transform	EEG; KINEMATICS; INTERFACE; SELECTION; SIGNALS; REACH; LFP	The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems is an important approach in brain studies. Control of communication devices and prostheses in real-world scenarios requires complex movement parameters. Decoding a variety of neural signals captured by micro-wire arrays is a potential applicant for extracting movement-related information. The present work was conducted to compare the functionality of partial least square (PLS) regression and Kalman filter to predict the force parameter from local field potential (LFP) signals of the primary motor cortex (M1). The signals were recorded using a 16-channel micro-wire array from the forelimb-related area of the M1 of three rats performing a behavioral task in which the force signal of the rat's forelimb paw was generated. Our results show that PLS regression and Kalman filters with the mean performance of 0.75 and 0.72 in terms of the correlation coefficient (CC) and 0.37 and 0.48 in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE), respectively, are effective methods for decoding the force parameter from LFPs. Kalman filter underperforms PLS both in performance and speed. Although adding nonlinearity to the Kalman filter results in equally accurate CC performance as PLS, it has even more computational cost. Therefore, it is inferred that nonlinear methods do not necessarily have better functionality than linear ones and PLS, as a simple fast linear method could be an effectively applicable regression technique for BCIs.

Here, we assess the dependence of DOA on the concentration of isoflurane by analyzing local-field potentials (LFPs) recorded in mouse visual cortex. To capture the DOA-related changes, we employed TESPAR and Fourier-based feature extraction techniques. combined with machine learning. In addition, we performed an analysis of bursts present in LFP signals and evaluated their influence on DOA classification. These bursts are characterized by high amplitudes and low frequencies, requiring different analysis approaches: one that removes the high amplitudes and the other one that filters the lower frequencies. We developed procedures that successfully discriminate between different levels of anesthesia. Our study indicates a correlation between increased isoflurane dose and LFP amplitude suppression and also indicates that large amplitude bursts are expressed in the signal in a dose-dependent manner.

In this paper, we build a machine learning model that estimates the enjoyment and visual interest level of individuals experiencing museum content. The input to the model is comprised of 8-channel electroencephalogram signals, which we processed using multiscale entropy analysis to extract three features: the mean, slope of the curve, and complexity index (i.e., the area under the curve). Then, the number of features was drastically reduced using principle component analysis without a notable loss of accuracy. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that there exists a statistically significant correlation (i.e.,p<0.05) between the extracted features and the enjoyment level. Moreover, the classification model was able to predict the enjoyment level with a mean squared error of 0.1474 and an accuracy of 98.0%, which outperforms methods in the existing literature.

It is often hypothesised that a reversal in neural processing underlies the generation of mental images as abstract representations are used to construct sensory representations in the absence of sensory input. According to predictive processing theories, such reversed processing also plays a central role in later stages of perception. Direct experimental evidence of reversals in neural information flow has been missing. Here, we used a combination of machine learning and magnetoencephalography to characterise neural dynamics in humans. We provide direct evidence for a reversal of the perceptual feed-forward cascade during imagery and show that, during perception, such reversals alternate with feed-forward processing in an 11 Hz oscillatory pattern.

Sensorimotor Functional Connectivity: A Neurophysiological Factor Related to BCI Performance	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						connectivity; sensorimotor signals; BCI performance; mu-band; BCI efficiency; pre-stimulus	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MOTOR IMAGERY; RHYTHMS; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; PATTERNS; VOLUME	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that allow users to control devices using brain activity alone. However, the ability of participants to command BCIs varies from subject to subject. About 20% of potential users of sensorimotor BCIs do not gain reliable control of the system. The inefficiency to decode user's intentions requires the identification of neurophysiological factors determining "good" and "poor" BCI performers. One of the important neurophysiological aspects in BCI research is that the neuronal oscillations, used to control these systems, show a rich repertoire of spatial sensorimotor interactions. Considering this, we hypothesized that neuronal connectivity in sensorimotor areas would define BCI performance. Analyses for this study were performed on a large dataset of 80 inexperienced participants. They took part in a calibration and an online feedback session recorded on the same day. Undirected functional connectivity was computed over sensorimotor areas by means of the imaginary part of coherency. The results show that post- as well as pre-stimulus connectivity in the calibration recording is significantly correlated to online feedback performance in mu and feedback frequency bands. Importantly, the significance of the correlation between connectivity and BCI feedback accuracy was not due to the signal-to-noise ratio of the oscillations in the corresponding post and pre-stimulus intervals. Thus, this study demonstrates that BCI performance is not only dependent on the amplitude of sensorimotor oscillations as shown previously, but that it also relates to sensorimotor connectivity measured during the preceding training session. The presence of such connectivity between motor and somatosensory systems is likely to facilitate motor imagery, which in turn is associated with the generation of a more pronounced modulation of sensorimotor oscillations (manifested in ERD/ERS) required for the adequate BCI performance. We also discuss strategies for the up-regulation of such connectivity in order to enhance BCI performance.

However, there is a large variability among patients with first episode psychosis (FEP). Also, most studies report a single electrode site and on comparing case-control group differences. Few have taken advantage of the full wealth of multi-channel EEG signals to examine observable patterns. None, to our knowledge, have used machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate neurophysiological derived subgroups with distinct cognitive and functional outcome characteristics. In this study, we applied ML to empirically stratify individuals into homogeneous subgroups based on multi-channel MMN data. We then characterized the functional, cognitive, and clinical profiles of these neurobiologically derived subgroups. We also explored the underlying low frequency range responses (delta, theta, alpha) during MMN. Methods Clinical, neurocognitive, functioning data of 33 healthy controls and 20 FEP patients were collected. 90% of the patients had 6-month follow-up data. Neurocognition, social cognition, and functioning measures were assessed using the NCCB Cognitive Battery, the Awareness of Social Inference Test, UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment, and Multnomah Community Ability Scale. Symptom severity was collected using the PANSS. MMN amplitude and single-trial derived low frequency activity across 24 frontocentral channels were used as main variables in the ML k-means clustering analyses. Results We found a consistent pattern of two distinctive subgroups. We labeled them as "better functioning" and "poorer functioning" clusters, respectively. Each subgroup can be mapped onto either better or poorer clinical, cognitive, and functioning profiles. Also, we identified two subgroups of patients: one showed improved MMN and one showed worsening of MMN over time. Patients with improved MMN had better follow-up clinical, cognitive, and functioning profile than those with worsening MMN. Among the low frequency bands, delta frequency appeared to be the most relevant to the observed MMN responses in all individuals. However, higher delta responses were not necessarily associated with a better functioning profile, suggesting that delta frequency alone may not be useful in clinical characterization. Conclusions The ML approach could be a robust tool to explore heterogeneity and facilitate the identification of neurobiological homogeneous subgroups in FEP.

Clinical and research aspects are accordingly varied, ranging from epidemiological to molecular, spanning clinical trials and outcomes, gene and drug discovery, imaging, electroencephalography, pathology, epilepsy surgery, digital technologies, and numerous others. Epilepsy data are collected in the terabytes and petabytes, pushing the limits of current capabilities. Modern computing firepower and advances in machine and deep learning, pioneered in other diseases, open up exciting possibilities for epilepsy too. However, without carefully designed approaches to acquiring, standardizing, curating, and making available such data, there is a risk of failure. Thus, careful construction of relevant ontologies, with intimate stakeholder inputs, provides the requisite scaffolding for more ambitious big data undertakings, such as an epilepsy data commons. In this review, we assess the clinical and research epilepsy landscapes in the big data arena, current challenges, and future directions, and make the case for a systematic approach to epilepsy big data.

Since operational environments are highly dynamic, priorities across tasks will be expected to change as the mission evolves, thus the capability to reallocate the mental resources dynamically depending on such changes is very important. The resources required in very complex situations, such as air traffic management (ATM), can exceed the user's available resources leading to increased workload and performance impairments. In this regard, the availability of information concerning the workload experienced by the operators while dealing with tasks will be fundamental for both warning them when overload conditions are approaching and improving interactions with the system. The idea of our work was to use neurophysiologic data collected from professional air traffic controllers (ATCOs) to provide additional information to standard measures with which to assess the ATCOs' expertise and a machine learning electroencephalography-based index to evaluate their mental workload during the execution of ATC tasks. The results showed that the proposed method was able to track the workload alongside the execution of the realistic ATM scenario, and provide added values to objectively assess the expertise of the ATCOs.

The advanced deep learning method, a novel brain imaging technique, was applied in this study to evaluate its contribution to improving the diagnostic accuracy of AD. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) were applied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to execute binary and ternary disease classification models. The dataset from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) was used to compare the deep learning performances across 3D-CNN, 3D-CNN-support vector machine (SVM) and two-dimensional (2D)-CNN models. The outcomes of accuracy with ternary classification for 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN and 3D-CNN-SVM were 82.57 +/- 7.35%, 89.76 +/- 8.67% and 95.74 +/- 2.31% respectively. The 3D-CNN-SVM yielded a ternary classification accuracy of 93.71%, 96.82% and 96.73% for NC, MCI and AD diagnoses, respectively. Furthermore, 3D-CNN-SVM showed the best performance for binary classification. Our study indicated that 'NC versus MCI' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.90%, 98.90% and 98.80%; 'NC versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.10%, 99.80% and 98.40%; and 'MCI versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 89.40%, 86.70% and 84.00%, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates that 3D-CNN-SVM yields better performance with MRI compared to currently utilized deep learning methods. In addition, 3D-CNN-SVM proved to be efficient without having to manually perform any prior feature extraction and is totally independent of the variability of imaging protocols and scanners. This suggests that it can potentially be exploited by untrained operators and extended to virtual patient imaging data. Furthermore, owing to the safety, noninvasiveness and nonirradiative properties of the MRI modality, 3D-CNN-SMV may serve as an effective screening option for AD in the general population. This study holds value in distinguishing AD and MCI subjects from normal controls and to improve value-based care of patients in clinical practice.

A BCI system typically adopts a functional electrical stimulation (FES) system that activates weakened muscles that are otherwise responsible for actuating finger movements. A BCI-FES system can enable muscle contraction through the delivery of electrical stimulation pulses. The control of voltage or current stimulation parameters such as pulse width, frequency, and amplitude along with feedback signals from finger joints positions are essential for stable grasping. For the design of a closed-loop functional electrical stimulation controller, it is obligatory to set standard reference trajectories of finger joints' angular positions and velocities for controlling stimulation parameters in neuroprosthetics and rehabilitation. This study proposes a new closed-loop control architecture targeted for achieving successful and stable grasping of an upper limb paralyzed subject. This can be achieved by characterizing each of the finger joints' instantaneous angular position and velocity, through reference trajectories. These reference trajectories are generated corresponding to various types of grasping for feeding to the controller, responsible for stimulation of muscles. Hence, to generate such trajectories, first, grasping classification has been implemented using standard machine learning algorithms on a large set of existing real-time data of different types of objects' grasping such as various diameter, abducted thumb and other types of objects, from many healthy subjects. The results demonstrate the successful implementation of fairly accurate classifications and trajectory generations which are crucial for closed-loop control towards stable grasping.

Signal quality and patient experience with wearable devices for epilepsy management	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						epilepsy; patient experience; signal quality; wearable devices	LONG-TERM	Noninvasive wearable devices have great potential to aid the management of epilepsy, but these devices must have robust signal quality, and patients must be willing to wear them for long periods of time. Automated machine learning classification of wearable biosensor signals requires quantitative measures of signal quality to automatically reject poor-quality or corrupt data segments. In this study, commercially available wearable sensors were placed on patients with epilepsy undergoing in-hospital or in-home electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and healthy volunteers. Empatica E4 and Biovotion Everion were used to record accelerometry (ACC), photoplethysmography (PPG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). Byteflies Sensor Dots were used to record ACC and PPG, the Activinsights GENEActiv watch to record ACC, and Epitel Epilog to record EEG data. PPG and EDA signals were recorded for multiple days, then epochs of high-quality, marginal-quality, or poor-quality data were visually identified by reviewers, and reviewer annotations were compared to automated signal quality measures. For ACC, the ratio of spectral power from 0.8 to 5 Hz to broadband power was used to separate good-quality signals from noise. For EDA, the rate of amplitude change and prevalence of sharp peaks significantly differentiated between good-quality data and noise. Spectral entropy was used to assess PPG and showed significant differences between good-, marginal-, and poor-quality signals. EEG data were evaluated using methods to identify a spectral noise cutoff frequency. Patients were asked to rate the usability and comfort of each device in several categories. Patients showed a significant preference for the wrist-worn devices, and the Empatica E4 device was preferred most often. Current wearable devices can provide high-quality data and are acceptable for routine use, but continued development is needed to improve data quality, consistency, and management, as well as acceptability to patients.

As a result of these delays, the visual information available to the brain always lags behind the timing of events in the present moment. Compensating for these delays is crucial for functioning within dynamic environments, since interacting with a moving object (e.g., catching a ball) requires real-time localization of the object. One way the brain might achieve this is via prediction of anticipated events. Using time-resolved decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data, we demonstrate that the visual system represents the anticipated future position of a moving object, showing that predictive mechanisms activate the same neural representations as afferent sensory input. Importantly, this activation is evident before sensory input corresponding to the stimulus position is able to arrive. Finally, we demonstrate that, when predicted events do not eventuate, sensory information arrives too late to prevent the visual system from representing what was expected but never presented. Taken together, we demonstrate how the visual system can implement predictive mechanisms to preactivate sensory representations, and argue that this might allow it to compensate for its own temporal constraints, allowing us to interact with dynamic visual environments in real time.

Here we demonstrate the proof-of-concept of a minimally-invasive fUS imaging approach to detect the acute cholinergic modulatory effects of Scopolamine (ScoP) on functional brain connectivity in awake and behaving mice, through the intact skull. A machine-learning algorithm constructed an ad-hoc pharmacological score from the ScoP-induced changes in connectivity patterns of five mice. The discrimination model shows important ScoP-induced increase of the hippocampo-cortical connectivity. The pharmacological score led to robust discrimination of ScoP treatment from baseline in an independent dataset and showed, in another independent group, dose-dependent specific effects of central cholinergic modulation of functional connectivity, independent from global brain perfusion changes. In conclusion, we introduce pharmaco-fUS as a simple, robust, specific and sensitive modality to monitor drug effects on perfusion and functional connectivity in the awake mouse brain.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) involves a large number of sensors allowing better spatiotemporal resolution for assessing brain activity patterns. There have been many efforts to develop BCI using MEG with high accuracy, though an increase in the number of channels (NoC) means an increase in computational complexity. However, not all sensors necessarily contribute significantly to an increase in classification accuracy (CA) and specifically in the case of MEG-based BCI no channel selection methodology has been performed. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of channel selection on the performance of MEG-based BCI. Approach. MEG data were recorded for two sessions from 15 healthy participants performing motor imagery, cognitive imagery and a mixed imagery task pair using a unique paradigm. Performance of four state-of-the-art channel selection methods (i.e. Class-Correlation, ReliefF, Random Forest, and Infinite Latent Feature Selection were applied across six binary tasks in three different frequency bands) were evaluated in this study on two state-of-the-art features, i.e. bandpower and common spatial pattern (CSP). Main results. All four methods provided a statistically significant increase in CA compared to a baseline method using all gradiometer sensors, i.e. 204 channels with band-power features from alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), or broadband (alpha + beta) (8-30 Hz). It is also observed that the alpha frequency band performed better than the beta and broadband frequency bands. The performance of the beta band gave the lowest CA compared with the other two bands. Channel selection improved accuracy irrespective of feature types. Moreover, all the methods reduced the NoC significantly, from 204 to a range of 1-25, using bandpower as a feature and from 15 to 105 for CSP. The optimal channel number also varied not only in each session but also for each participant. Reducing the NoC will help to decrease the computational cost and maintain numerical stability in cases of low trial numbers. Significance. The study showed significant improvement in performance of MEG-BCI with channel selection irrespective of feature type and hence can be successfully applied for BCI applications.

J	Oralhan, Z				Oralhan, Zeki			3D Input Convolutional Neural Networks for P300 Signal Detection	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; deep Learning; human machine systems; P300 detection	BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; SPELLER	P300 signal is an endogenous event related potential component. It is mostly elicited from the frontal to parietal brain lobes. Electroencephalography is used for acquiring P300 signal from scalp. P300 signal is used for brain-computer interface systems. P300 based brain-computer interface systems are preferable since they have high overall performance. The most significant overall performance indicator is information transfer rate for P300 based brain-computer interface systems. P300 signal detection accuracy and P300 detection time are using for information transfer rate calculation. Hence, P300 signal classification accuracy is important for getting higher information transfer rate. In this study, it is aimed to investigate P300 detection model for higher classification accuracy. Thus, it is proposed 3-dimensional input convolutional neural network model for P300 detection. Moreover, the proposed model was applied with region based P300 speller which constituted audio and visual stimuli. In experiments, the participants were asked to spell desired words in two sessions which were offline and online session. Linear support vector machine, stepwise linear discriminant analysis, 2-dimensional input convolutional neural network, and the proposed method were compared in both online and offline sessions. It is reached highest average classification accuracy rate with the proposed method in both sessions. According to the online session result, average classification accuracy was 94.22% in 3-dimensional input convolutional neural network model. Furthermore, average information transfer rate was 5.53 bit/min in 3-dimensional input convolutional neural network model. We have also applied methods on BCI competition III-dataset II for 2 participants "A" and "B" for evaluating performance of algorithms. The proposed method had higher classification accuracy rate than linear support vector machine, stepwise linear discriminant analysis, 2-dimensional input convolutional neural network, and multi-classifier convolutional neural network which was used in other study on same dataset.

Video-based motion-resilient reconstruction of three-dimensional position for functional near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalography head mounted probes	NEUROPHOTONICS			English	Article						functional near-infrared spectroscopy; infant neuroimaging; spatial co-registration; photogrammetry; convolutional neural network	SPATIAL REGISTRATION; VALIDATION; INFANTS; CORTEX; SCALP; SPACE	Significance: We propose a video-based, motion-resilient, and fast method for estimating the position of optodes on the scalp. Aim: Measuring the exact placement of probes (e.g., electrodes and optodes) on a participant's head is a notoriously difficult step in acquiring neuroimaging data from methods that rely on scalp recordings (e.g., electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy) and is particularly difficult for any clinical or developmental population. Existing methods of head measurements require the participant to remain still for a lengthy period of time, are laborious, and require extensive training. Therefore, a fast and motion-resilient method is required for estimating the scalp location of probes. Approach: We propose an innovative video-based method for estimating the probes' positions relative to the participant's head, which is fast, motion-resilient, and automatic. Our method builds on capitalizing the advantages and understanding the limitations of cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning tools. We validate our method on 10 adult subjects and provide proof of feasibility with infant subjects. Results: We show that our method is both reliable and valid compared to existing state-of-the-art methods by estimating probe positions in a single measurement and by tracking their translation and consistency across sessions. Finally, we show that our automatic method is able to estimate the position of probes on an infant head without lengthy offline procedures, a task that has been considered challenging until now. Conclusions: Our proposed method allows, for the first time, the use of automated spatial coregistration methods on developmental and clinical populations, where lengthy, motion-sensitive measurement methods routinely fail.

We investigated whether this objective measure of SI can also be used with natural speech as a stimulus, as this would be beneficial for clinical applications. Design: We recorded the EEG in 19 normal-hearing participants while they listened to two types of stimuli: Matrix sentences and a natural story. Each stimulus was presented at different levels of SI by adding speech weighted noise. SI was assessed in two ways for both stimuli: (1) behaviorally and (2) objectively by reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG using a linear decoder and correlating it with the acoustic envelope. We also calculated temporal response functions (TRFs) to investigate the temporal characteristics of the brain responses in the EEG channels covering different brain areas. Results: For both stimulus types, the correlation between the speech envelope and the reconstructed envelope increased with increasing SI. In addition, correlations were higher for the natural story than for the Matrix sentences. Similar to the linear decoder analysis, TRF amplitudes increased with increasing SI for both stimuli. Remarkable is that although SI remained unchanged under the no-noise and +2.5 dB SNR conditions, neural speech processing was affected by the addition of this small amount of noise: TRF amplitudes across the entire scalp decreased between 0 and 150 ms, while amplitudes between 150 and 200 ms increased in the presence of noise. TRF latency changes in function of SI appeared to be stimulus specific: the latency of the prominent negative peak in the early responses (50 to 300 ms) increased with increasing SI for the Matrix sentences, but remained unchanged for the natural story. Conclusions: These results show (1) the feasibility of natural speech as a stimulus for the objective measure of SI; (2) that neural tracking of speech is enhanced using a natural story compared to Matrix sentences; and (3) that noise and the stimulus type can change the temporal characteristics of the brain responses. These results might reflect the integration of incoming acoustic features and top-down information, suggesting that the choice of the stimulus has to be considered based on the intended purpose of the measurement.

Raw signals were gathered from 64-channel scalp electroencephalograms of 11 healthy participants. Firstly, the cortical source model was defined with 62 regions of interest over the sensorimotor cortex (nine Brodmann areas). Secondly, functional connectivity was calculated by phase lock value for alpha and beta rhythm networks. Thirdly, network-based statistics were applied to identify whether there existed stable and significant subnetworks that formed between the two types of motor imagery tasks. Meanwhile, ten graph theory indices were investigated for each network by t-test to determine statistical significance between tasks. Finally, sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR)-support vector machine (SVM), as a feature selection and classification model, was used to analyze the graph theory features. The specific time-frequency (alpha event-related desynchronization and beta event-related synchronization) difference network between the two tasks was congregated at the midline and demonstrated significant connections in the premotor areas and primary somatosensory cortex. A few of statistically significant differences in the network properties were observed between tasks in the alpha and beta rhythm. The SMLR-SVM classification model achieved fair discrimination accuracy between imaginary movements of the two feet (maximum 75% accuracy rate in single-trial analyses). This study reveals the network mechanism of the discrimination of the left and right foot motor imagery. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study focuses on improving a CSP-based algorithm for detecting the motor imagery movement patterns. A discriminative filter bank of CSP method using a discriminative sensitive learning vector quantization (DFBCSP-DSLVQ) system is implemented. Four algorithms are then combined to form three methods for improving the efficiency of the DFBCSP-DSLVQ method, namely the kernel linear discriminant analysis (KLDA), the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), the soft margin support vector machine (SSVM) classifier and the generalized radial bases functions (GRBF) kernel. The GRBF is used as a kernel for the KLDA, the KPCA feature selection algorithms and the SSVM classifier. In addition, three types of classifiers, namely K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), neural network (NN) and traditional support vector machine (SVM), are employed to evaluate the efficiency of the classifiers. Results show that the best algorithm is the combination of the DFBCSP-DSLVQ method using the SSVM classifier with GRBF kernel (SSVM-GRBF), in which the best average accuracy, attained are 92.70% and 83.21%, respectively. Results of the Repeated Measures ANOVA shows the statistically significant dominance of this method at p < 0.05. The presented algorithms are then compared with the base algorithm of this study i.e. the DFBCSP-DSLVQ with the SVM-RBF classifier. It is concluded that the algorithms, which are based on the SSVM-GRBF classifier and the KLDA with the SSVM-GRBF classifiers give sufficient accuracy and reliable results.

Conventional MEG, however, relies on sensors that sample from a distance (20-40 mm) to the head due to thermal insulation requirements (the MEG sensors function at 4 K in a helmet). A gain in signal strength and spatial resolution may be achieved if sensors are moved closer to the head. Here, we report a study comparing measurements from a seven-channel on-scalp SQUID MEG system to those from a conventional (in-helmet) SQUID MEG system. We compared the spatio-temporal resolution between on-scalp and conventional MEG by comparing the discrimination accuracy for neural activity patterns resulting from stimulating five different phalanges of the right hand. Because of proximity and sensor density differences between on-scalp and conventional MEG, we hypothesized that on-scalp MEG would allow for a more high-resolved assessment of these activity patterns, and therefore also a better classification performance in discriminating between neural activations from the different phalanges. We observed that on-scalp MEG provided better classification performance during an early post-stimulus period (10-20 ms). This corresponded to the electroencephalographic (EEG) component P16/N16 and was an unexpected observation as this component is usually not observed in conventional MEG. This finding shows that on-scalp MEG enables a richer registration of the cortical signal, indicating a sensitivity to what are potentially sources in the thalamo-cortical radiation. We had originally expected that on-scalp MEG would provide better classification accuracy based on activity in proximity to the P60m component compared to conventional MEG. This component indeed allowed for the best classification performance for both MEG systems (60-75%, chance 50%). However, we did not find that on-scalp MEG allowed for better classification than conventional MEG at this latency. We suggest that this absence of differences is due to the limited sensor coverage in the recording, in combination with our strategy for positioning the on-scalp MEG sensors. We show how the current sensor coverage may have limited our chances to register the necessary between-phalange source field dissimilarities for fair hypothesis testing, an approach we otherwise believe to be useful for future benchmarking measurements.

A computational paradigm for real-time MEG neurofeedback for dynamic allocation of spatial attention	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Neurofeedback; Spatial attention; Decoding; Brain state	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA; EEG; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; MEMORY	Background Neurofeedback aids volitional control of one's own brain activity using non-invasive recordings of brain activity. The applications of neurofeedback include improvement of cognitive performance and treatment of various psychiatric and neurological disorders. During real-time magnetoencephalography (rt-MEG), sensor-level or source-localized brain activity is measured and transformed into a visual feedback cue to the subject. Recent real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback studies have used pattern recognition techniques to decode and train a brain state to link brain activities and cognitive behaviors. Here, we utilize the real-time decoding technique similar to ones employed in rt-fMRI to analyze time-varying rt-MEG signals. Results We developed a novel rt-MEG method, state-based neurofeedback (sb-NFB), to decode a time-varying brain state, a state signal, from which timings are extracted for neurofeedback training. The approach is entirely data-driven: it uses sensor-level oscillatory activity to find relevant features that best separate the targeted brain states. In a psychophysical task of spatial attention switching, we trained five young, healthy subjects using the sb-NFB method to decrease the time necessary for switch spatial attention from one visual hemifield to the other (referred to as switch time). Training resulted in a decrease in switch time with training. We saw that the activity targeted by the training involved proportional changes in alpha and beta-band oscillations, in sensors at the occipital and parietal regions. We also found that the state signal that encodes whether subjects attend to the left or right visual field effectively switches consistently with the task. Conclusion We demonstrated the use of the sb-NFB method when the subject learns to increase the speed of shifting covert spatial attention from one visual field to the other. The sb-NFB method can target timing features that would otherwise also include extraneous features such as visual detection and motor response in a simple reaction time task.

Eye movements recognized based on the EOG signal pattern are utilized to govern the HCI system and do a specific job based on the type of eye movement. With the knowledge of various related examinations, this paper intends a novel model for eye movement recognition based on EOG signals by utilizing Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) with neural network (NN). Here, the GWO is used to minimize the error function from the classifier. The performance of the proposed methodology was investigated by comparing the developed model with conventional methods. The results reveal the loftier performance of the adopted method with the error minimization analysis and recognition performance analysis in correspondence with varied performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, false-positive rate (FPR), false-negative rate (FNR), negative predictive value (NPV), false discovery rate (FDR) and the F-1 score.

Both approaches typically result in a set of real-valued weights, that pose challenges when targeting real-time execution on tightly resource-constrained devices. We propose methods for each of these approaches that allow transforming real-valued weights to binary numbers for efficient inference. Our first method, based on sparse bipolar random projection, projects a large number of real-valued Riemannian covariance features to a binary space, where a linear SVM classifier can be learned with binary weights too. By tuning the dimension of the binary embedding, we achieve almost the same accuracy in 4-class MI (<= 1.27% lower) compared to models with float16 weights, yet delivering a more compact model with simpler operations to execute. Second, we propose to use memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) for MI-BCI such that the augmented memory is binarized. Our method replaces the fully connected layer of CNNs with a binary augmented memory using bipolar random projection, or learned projection. Our experimental results on EEGNet, an already compact CNN for MI-BCI, show that it can be compressed by 1.28x at iso-accuracy using the random projection. On the other hand, using the learned projection provides 3.89% higher accuracy but increases the memory size by 28.10x.

However, no generic solution is currently available to reach these objectives. A number of biosignals are sensitive to specific forms of focal seizures, in particular heart rate and its variability for seizures affecting the neurovegetative system, and accelerometry for those responsible for prominent motor activity. However, most studies demonstrate high rates of false detection or poor sensitivity, with only a minority of patients benefiting from acceptable levels of accuracy. To tackle this challenging issue, several lines of technological progress are envisioned, including multimodal biosensing with cross-modal analytics, a combination of embedded and distributed self-aware machine learning, and ultra-low-power design to enable appropriate autonomy of such sophisticated portable solutions.

We here elaborate the hypothesis that such uncertainty is not just a nuisance, but that on the contrary is condition-dependent. We test this hypothesis by analysing a large set of EEG brain recordings corresponding to control subjects and patients suffering from alcoholism, through the reconstruction of the corresponding Maximum Spanning Trees (MSTs), the assessment of their topological differences, and the comparison of two frequentist and Bayesian reconstruction approaches. A machine learning model demonstrates that the Bayesian reconstruction encodes more information than the frequentist one, and that such additional information is related to the uncertainty of the topological structures. We finally show how the Bayesian approach is more effective in the validation of generative models, over and above the frequentist one, by proposing and disproving two models based on additive noise.

This objective is fulfilled by first capturing EEG signals from ten subjects involved in mental utterance of seven vowel sounds. The eLORETA analysis of the acquired signals confirms the involvement of occipital, parietal and prefrontal lobes for this cognitive activity. The procured signals undergo the process of feature extraction after eradication of artifacts and are transferred to a novel capsule network module for categorization of seven class labels. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier with respect to other standard ones. Moreover, statistical evaluation also assures the superior performance of the proposed classifier model. A coding scheme has also been proposed to signify the consonants by the coalescence of two vowel sounds segregated by a space. Thus, the proposed methodology can be effectively utilized as a mind controlled type writing system to serve the needs of disabled individuals. Additionally, this technique can also be used in certain military scenarios that demand non-verbal communication as a secure option and in various BCI based gaming applications.

In this paper, we consider a screen-free Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), where the robot highlights candidate objects in the environment using a laser pointer, and the user goal is decoded from the evoked responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Having the robot present stimuli in the environment allows for more direct commands than traditional BCIs that require the use of graphical user interfaces. Yet bypassing a screen entails less control over stimulus appearances. In realistic environments, this leads to heterogeneous brain responses for dissimilar objects-posing a challenge for reliable EEG classification. We model object instances as subclasses to train specialized classifiers in the Riemannian tangent space, each of which is regularized by incorporating data from other objects. In multiple experiments with a total of 19 healthy participants, we show that our approach not only increases classification performance but is also robust to both heterogeneous and homogeneous objects. While especially useful in the case of a screen-free BCI, our approach can naturally be applied to other experimental paradigms with potential subclass structure.

J	Yousefi, F; Kolivand, H; Baker, T				Yousefi, Fares; Kolivand, Hoshang; Baker, Thar			SaS-BCI: a new strategy to predict image memorability and use mental imagery as a brain-based biometric authentication	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Brain-Computer Interface; Biometric authentication; EEG; Signal acquisition	PERSON AUTHENTICATION; EEG	Security authentication is one of the most important levels of information security. Nowadays, human biometric techniques are the most secure methods for authentication purposes that cover the problems of older types of authentication like passwords and pins. There are many advantages of recent biometrics in terms of security; however, they still have some disadvantages. Progresses in technology made some specific devices, which make it possible to copy and make a fake human biometric because they are all visible and touchable. According to this matter, there is a need for a new biometric to cover the issues of other types. Brainwave is human data, which uses them as a new type of security authentication that has engaged many researchers. There are some research and experiments, which are investigating and testing EEG signals to find the uniqueness of human brainwave. Some researchers achieved high accuracy rates in this area by applying different signal acquisition techniques, feature extraction and classifications using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). One of the important parts of any BCI processes is the way that brainwaves could be acquired and recorded. A new Signal Acquisition Strategy is presented in this paper for the process of authorization and authentication of brain signals specifically. This is to predict image memorability from the user's brain to use mental imagery as a visualization pattern for security authentication. Therefore, users can authenticate themselves with visualizing a specific picture in their minds. In conclusion, we can see that brainwaves can be different according to the mental tasks, which it would make it harder using them for authentication process. There are many signal acquisition strategies and signal processing for brain-based authentication that by using the right methods, a higher level of accuracy rate could be achieved which is suitable for using brain signal as another biometric security authentication.

Currently only similar to 60% of well selected patients become postsurgically seizure-free underlining the need for better tools to identify the epileptogenic zone. This article reviews the latest neurophysiological advances for EZ localization with emphasis on ictal EZ identification, interictal EZ markers, and noninvasive neurophysiological mapping procedures. Recent findings We will review methods for computerized EZ assessment, summarize computational network approaches for outcome prediction and individualized surgical planning. We will discuss electrical stimulation as an option to reduce the time needed for presurgical work-up. We will summarize recent research regarding high-frequency oscillations, connectivity measures, and combinations of multiple markers using machine learning. This latter was shown to outperform single markers. The role of NREM sleep for best identification of the EZ interictally will be discussed. We will summarize recent large-scale studies using electrical or magnetic source imaging for clinical decision-making. New approaches based on technical advancements paired with artificial intelligence are on the horizon for better EZ identification. They are ultimately expected to result in a more efficient, less invasive, and less time-demanding presurgical investigation.

Such cognitively capable children are ideal candidates for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). While BCI systems are rapidly evolving, a fundamental gap exists between technological innovators and the patients and families who stand to benefit. Forays into translating BCI systems to children in recent years have revealed that kids can learn to operate simple BCI with proficiency akin to adults. BCI could bring significant boons to the lives of many children with severe physical impairment, supporting their complex physical and social needs. However, children have been neglected in BCI research and a collaborative BCI research community is required to unite and push pediatric BCI development forward. To this end, the pediatric BCI Canada collaborative network (BCI-CAN) was formed, under a unified goal to cooperatively drive forward pediatric BCI innovation and impact. This article reflects on the topics and discussions raised in the foundational BCI-CAN meeting held in Toronto, ON, Canada in November 2019 and suggests the next steps required to see BCI impact the lives of children with severe neurological disease and their families.

On the (in)efficacy of motor imagery training without feedback and event-related desynchronizations considerations	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						electroencephalography; motor imagery; motor imagery training; feedback; event-related desynchronization; neurofeedback	(DE)SYNCHRONIZATION ERD/ERS; BCI; REHABILITATION; EXECUTION; RECOVERY; TRIAL	Motor imagery (MI) constitutes a recurrent strategy for signals generation in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) - systems that aim to control external devices by directly associating brain responses to distinct commands. Although great improvement has been achieved in MI-BCIs performance over recent years, they still suffer from inter- and intra-subject variability issues. As an attempt to cope with this, some studies have suggested that MI training should aid users to appropriately modulate their response for BCI usage: generally, this training is performed based on the sensorimotor rhythms' modulation over the primary sensorimotor cortex (PMC), with the signal being feedbacked to the user. Nonetheless, recent studies have revisited the actual involvement of the PMC into MI, and little to no attention has been devoted to understanding the participation of other cortical areas into training protocols. Therefore, in this work, our aim was to analyze the response induced by hands MI of 10 healthy subjects in the form of event-related desynchronizations (ERDs) and to assess whether features from beyond the PMC might be useful for hands MI classification. We investigated how this response occurs for distinct frequency intervals between 7-30 Hz, and ex0plored changes in their evocation pattern across 12 MI training sessions without feedback. Overall, we found that ERD patterns occur differently for the frequencies encompassed by the mu and beta bands, with its evocation being favored for the first band. Over time, the no-feedback approach was inefficient to aid in enhancing ERD evocation (EO). Moreover, to some extent, EO tends to decrease over blocks within a given run, and runs within an MI session, but remains stable within an MI block. We also found that the C3/C4 pair is not necessarily optimal for data classification, and both spectral and spatial subjects' specificities should be considered when designing training protocols.

It can denote a state of increased sleepiness and lack of drive (i.e., downregulated arousal) as well as a state of high inner tension and inhibition of drive with long sleep onset latencies (i.e., upregulated arousal), the latter typically found in depression. It has been proposed to differentiate fatigue along the dimension of brain arousal. We investigated whether such stratification within a group of MDD patients would reveal a subgroup with distinct clinical features. Using an automatic classification of EEG vigilance stages, an arousal stability score was calculated for 15-min resting EEGs of 102 MDD patients with fatigue. 23.5% of the patients showed signs of hypoarousal with EEG patterns indicating drowsiness or sleep; this hypoaroused subgroup was compared with remaining patients (non-hypoaroused subgroup) concerning self-rated measures of depressive symptoms, sleepiness, and sleep. The hypoaroused subgroup scored higher on the Beck Depression Inventory items "loss of energy" (Z = - 2.13, p = 0.033; (2) = 0.044, 90% CI 0.003-0.128) and "concentration difficulty" (Z = - 2.40, p = 0.017; (2) = 0.056, 90% CI 0.009-0.139), and reported higher trait and state sleepiness (p < 0.05) as compared to the non-hypoaroused group. The non-hypoaroused subgroup, in contrast, reported more frequently the presence of suicidal ideation (Chi(2) = 3.81, p = 0.051; (2) = 0.037, 90% CI 0.0008-0.126). In this study, we found some evidence that stratifying fatigued MDD patients by arousal may lead to subgroups that are pathophysiologically and clinically more homogeneous. Brain arousal may be a worth while target in clinical research for better understanding the mechanisms underlying suicidal tendencies and to improve treatment response.

Developmental changes in the processing of faces as revealed by EEG decoding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Development; Face-processing; Children; Multivariate pattern analysis; EEG; N170	PATTERN-ANALYSIS; ADULTS EVIDENCE; ERP EVIDENCE; RECOGNITION; INVERSION; PERCEPTION; INFORMATION; CHILDREN; UPRIGHT; ACTIVATION	Rapidly and accurately processing information from faces is a critical human function that is known to improve with developmental age. Understanding the underlying drivers of this improvement remains a contentious question, with debate continuing as to the presence of early vs. late maturation of face-processing mechanisms. Recent behavioural evidence suggests an important 'hallmark' of expert face processing - the face inversion effect - is present in very young children, yet neural support for this remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a detailed investigation of the neural dynamics of face processing in children spanning a range of ages (6-11 years) and adults. Uniquely, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to the electroencephalogram signal (EEG) to test for the presence of a distinct neural profile associated with canonical upright faces when compared both to other objects (houses) and to inverted faces. Results revealed robust discrimination profiles, at the individual level, of differentiated neural activity associated with broad face categorization and further with its expert processing, as indexed by the face inversion effect, from the youngest ages tested. This result is consistent with an early functional maturation of broad face processing mechanisms. Yet, clear quantitative differences between the response profile of children and adults is suggestive of age-related refinement of this system with developing face and general expertise. Standard ERP analysis also provides some support for qualitative differences in the neural response to inverted faces in children in contrast to adults. This neural profile is in line with recent behavioural studies that have reported impressively expert early face abilities during childhood, while also providing novel evidence of the ongoing neural specialisation between child and adulthood.

Importance Neuroprognostication studies are potentially susceptible to a self-fulfilling prophecy as investigated prognostic parameters may affect withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. Objective To compare the results of prognostic parameters after cardiac arrest (CA) with the histopathologically determined severity of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) obtained from autopsy results. Design, Setting, and Participants In a retrospective, 3-center cohort study of all patients who died following cardiac arrest during their intensive care unit stay and underwent autopsy between 2003 and 2015, postmortem brain histopathologic findings were compared with post-CA brain computed tomographic imaging, electroencephalographic (EEG) findings, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and serum neuron-specific enolase levels obtained during the intensive care unit stay. Data analysis was conducted from 2015 to 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures The severity of HIE was evaluated according to the selective eosinophilic neuronal death (SEND) classification and patients were dichotomized into categories of histopathologically severe and no/mild HIE. Results Of 187 included patients, 117 were men (63%) and median age was 65 (interquartile range, 58-74) years. Severe HIE was found in 114 patients (61%) and no/mild HIE was identified in 73 patients (39%). Severe HIE was found in all 21 patients with bilaterally absent somatosensory-evoked potentials, all 15 patients with gray-white matter ratio less than 1.10 on brain computed tomographic imaging, all 9 patients with suppressed EEG, 15 of 16 patients with burst-suppression EEG, and all 29 patients with neuron-specific enolase levels greater than 67 mu g/L more than 48 hours after CA without confounders. Three of 7 patients with generalized periodic discharges on suppressed background and 1 patient with burst-suppression EEG had a SEND 1 score (<30% dead neurons) in the cerebral cortex, but higher SEND scores (>30% dead neurons) in other oxygen-sensitive brain regions. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, histopathologic findings suggested severe HIE after cardiac arrest in patients with bilaterally absent cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials, gray-white matter ratio less than 1.10, highly malignant EEG, and serum neuron-specific enolase concentration greater than 67 mu g/L. Question Is there evidence of a self-fulfilling prophecy following current international guidelines of neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest? Findings In this 3-center cohort study of 187 patients who underwent brain autopsy after cardiac arrest, histopathologically determined severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was noted in patients with bilaterally absent cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials, gray-white matter ratio of brain computed tomographic imaging less than 1.10, highly malignant electroencephalographic patterns, and serum neuron-specific enolase concentration greater than 67 mu g/L. Meaning The findings of this study appear to support the practice of neuroprognostication according to current international guidelines.

Stress reduces human functionality during routine work and may lead to severe health defects. Detecting stress is important in education and industry to determine the efficiency of teaching, to improve education, and to reduce risks from human errors that might occur due to workers' stressful situations. Therefore, the early detection of mental stress using machine learning (ML) techniques is essential to prevent illness and health problems, improve quality of education, and improve industrial safety. The human brain is the main target of mental stress. For this reason, an ML system is proposed which investigates electroencephalogram (EEG) signal for thirty-six participants. Extracting useful features is essential for an efficient mental stress detection (MSD) system. Thus, this framework introduces a hybrid feature-set that feeds five ML classifiers to detect stress and non-stress states, and classify stress levels. To produce a reliable, practical, and efficient MSD system with a reduced number of electrodes, the proposed MSD scheme investigates the electrodes placements on different sites on the scalp and selects that site which has the higher impact on the accuracy of the system. Principal Component analysis is employed also, to reduce the features extracted from such electrodes to lower model complexity, where the optimal number of principal components is examined using sequential forward procedure. Furthermore, it examines the minimum number of electrodes placed on the site which has greater impact on stress detection and evaluation. To test the effectiveness of the proposed system, the results are compared with other feature extraction methods shown in literature. They are also compared with state-of-the-art techniques recorded for stress detection. The highest accuracies achieved in this study are 99.9%(sd = 0.015) and 99.26% (sd = 0.08) for identifying stress and non-stress states, and distinguishing between stress levels, respectively, using only two frontal brain electrodes for detecting stress and non-stress, and three frontal electrodes for evaluating stress levels respectively. The results show that the proposed system is reliable as the sensitivity is 99.9(0.064), 98.35(0.27), specificity is 99.94(0.02), 99.6(0.05), precision is 99.94(0.06), 98.9(0.23), and the diagnostics odd ratio (DOR) is >= 100 for detecting stress and non-stress, and evaluating stress levels respectively. This shows that the proposed framework has compelling performance and can be employed for stress detection and evaluation in medical, educational and industrial fields. Finally, the results verified the efficiency and reliability of the proposed system in predicting stress and non-stress on new patients, as the accuracy achieved 98.48% (sd = 1.12), sensitivity = 97.78% (sd = 1.84), specificity = 97.75% (sd = 2.05), precision = 99.26% (sd = 0.67), and DOR >= 100 using only two frontal electrodes.

Although recent work has convincingly demonstrated that seizure risk assessment is in principle possible, these early approaches relied largely on complex, often invasive setups including intracranial electrocorticography, implanted devices, and multichannel electroencephalography, and required patient-specific adaptation or learning to perform optimally, all of which limit translation to broad clinical application. To facilitate broader adaptation of seizure forecasting in clinical practice, noninvasive, easily applicable techniques that reliably assess seizure risk without much prior tuning are crucial. Wristbands that continuously record physiological parameters, including electrodermal activity, body temperature, blood volume pulse, and actigraphy, may afford monitoring of autonomous nervous system function and movement relevant for such a task, hence minimizing potential complications associated with invasive monitoring and avoiding stigma associated with bulky external monitoring devices on the head. Methods Here, we applied deep learning on multimodal wristband sensor data from 69 patients with epilepsy (total duration > 2311 hours, 452 seizures) to assess its capability to forecast seizures in a statistically significant way. Results Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach, we identified better-than-chance predictability in 43% of the patients. Time-matched seizure surrogate data analyses indicated forecasting not to be driven simply by time of day or vigilance state. Prediction performance peaked when all sensor modalities were used, and did not differ between generalized and focal seizure types, but generally increased with the size of the training dataset, indicating potential further improvement with larger datasets in the future. Significance Collectively, these results show that statistically significant seizure risk assessments are feasible from easy-to-use, noninvasive wearable devices without the need of patient-specific training or parameter optimization.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is clinically used as a presurgical tool in locating the epileptogenic zone by localising either interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) or ictal activities. The localisation of ictal onset provides reliable and more accurate seizure onset zones rather than localising the IEDs. Ictals or seizures are presently detected during MEG analysis by manually inspecting the recorded data. This is laborious when the duration of recordings is longer. Methods: We propose a novel method which uses statistical features such as short-time permutation entropy (STPE), gradient of STPE (GSTPE), short-time energy (STE) and short-time mean (STM) extracted from the ictal and interictal MEG data of drug resistant epilepsy patients group. Since the data is heavily skewed, the RUSBoost algorithm with k-fold cross-validation is used to classify the data into ictal and interictal by using the four feature vectors. This method is further used for localising the epileptogenic region using region-specific classifications by means of the RUSBoost algorithm. Results: The accuracy obtained for seizure detection is 93.4%. The specificity and sensitivity for the same are 93%. The localisation accuracies for each lobe are in the range of 88.1-99.1%. Discussion: Through this ictus detection method, the current scenario of laborious inspection of the ictal MEG can be reduced. The proposed system, thus, can be implemented in real-time as a better and more efficient method for seizure detection and further it can prove to be highly beneficial for patients and health-care professionals during real-time MEG recording. Furthermore, the identification of the epileptogenic lobe can provide clinicians with useful insights, and a pre-cursor for source localisation.

Non-negative Matrix Factorization Reveals Resting-State Cortical Alpha Network Abnormalities in the First-Episode Schizophrenia Spectrum	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Alpha; Machine learning; Magnetoencephalography; Network; Non-negative matrix factorization; Schizophrenia	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THOUGHT-DISORDER; NEURAL ACTIVITY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; EEG; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; COHERENCE	BACKGROUND: Little is known about neural oscillatory dynamics in first-episode psychosis. Pathophysiology of functional connectivity can be measured through network activity of alpha oscillations, reflecting long-range communication between distal brain regions. METHODS: Resting magnetoencephalographic activity was collected from 31 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis and 22 healthy control individuals. Activity was projected to the realistic cortical surface, based on structural magnetic resonance imaging. The first principal component of activity in 40 Brodmann areas per hemisphere was Hilbert transformed within the alpha range. Non-negative matrix factorization was applied to single-trial alpha phase-locking values from all subjects to determine alpha networks. Within networks, energy and entropy were compared. RESULTS: Four cortical alpha networks were pathological in individuals with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. The networks involved the bilateral anterior and posterior cingulate; left auditory, medial temporal, and cingulate cortex; right inferior frontal gyrus and widespread areas; and right posterior parietal cortex and widespread areas. Energy and entropy were associated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total and thought disorder factors for the first three networks. In addition, the left posterior temporal network was associated with positive and negative factors, and the right inferior frontal network was associated with the positive factor. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning network analysis of resting alpha-band neural activity identified several aberrant networks in individuals with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, including the left temporal, right inferior frontal, right posterior parietal, and bilateral cingulate cortices. Abnormal long-range alpha communication is evident at the first presentation for psychosis and may provide clues about mechanisms of dysconnectivity in psychosis and novel targets for noninvasive brain stimulation.

Many BCI approaches designed for communication rely on attention to visual stimuli, commonly applying an oddball paradigm, and require both eye movements and adequate visual acuity. These abilities may, however, be absent in patients who depend on BCI communication. We have therefore developed a response-based communication BCI, which is independent of gaze shifts but utilizes covert shifts of attention to the left or right visual field. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 29 channels and coregistered the vertical and horizontal electrooculogram. Data-driven decoding of small attention-based differences between the hemispheres, also known as N2pc, was performed using 14 posterior channels, which are expected to reflect correlates of visual spatial attention. Eighteen healthy participants responded to 120 statements by covertly directing attention to one of two colored symbols (green and red crosses for "yes" and "no," respectively), presented in the user's left and right visual field, respectively, while maintaining central gaze fixation. On average across participants, 88.5% (std: 7.8%) of responses were correctly decoded online. In order to investigate the potential influence of stimulus features on accuracy, we presented the symbols with different visual angles, by altering symbol size and eccentricity. The offline analysis revealed that stimulus features have a minimal impact on the controllability of the BCI. Hence, we show with our novel approach that spatial attention to a colored symbol is a robust method with which to control a BCI, which has the potential to support severely paralyzed people with impaired eye movements and low visual acuity in communicating with their environment.

Applications of brain-computer interfaces to the control of robotic and prosthetic arms	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES	Handbook of Clinical Neurology		English	Article; Book Chapter							ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MACHINE INTERFACE; CORTICAL CONTROL; NEURAL-CONTROL; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; MOVEMENT; SIGNALS; GRASP	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to improve the quality of life of individuals with severe motor disabilities. BCIs capture the user's brain activity and translate it into commands for the control of an effector, such as a computer cursor, robotic limb, or functional electrical stimulation device. Full dexterous manipulation of robotic and prosthetic arms via a BCI system has been a challenge because of the inherent need to decode high dimensional and preferably real-time control commands from the user's neural activity. Nevertheless, such functionality is fundamental if BCI-controlled robotic or prosthetic limbs are to be used for daily activities. In this chapter, we review how this challenge has been addressed by BCI researchers and how new solutions may improve the BCI user experience with robotic effectors.

However, the current BCI system has several shortcomings as it produces a comparatively lower accuracy for real-time implementations as well as the intuitive paradigm for the users cannot be well established here. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a highly intuitive BCI paradigm that combines event-related potential (ERP) with the speech-imagery task for the individual target objects. The decoding accuracy of the proposed paradigm was 88.1% (+/- 5.90) which is a much significant higher performance than a conventional ERP system. Furthermore, the amplitude of N700 components was significantly enhanced over frontal regions which are priory evoked by the speech-imagery task. Our results could be utilized to develop a smart home system so that it could be more user-friendly and convenient by means of delivering user's intentions both, intuitively and accurately.

Low-frequency components are extracted and processed in real time, and subspace system identification methods are used to derive the optimal, in mean squared sense, linear dynamics generating the position vectors. This results in a human-robot interface that can be used directly in robot teleoperation or as part of a shared-control robotic manipulation scheme, feels natural to the user, and is appropriate for upper extremity amputees, since it requires no limb movement. We validate our methodology by teleoperating a redundant, anthropomorphic robotic arm in real time. The system's performance outruns similar EMG-based systems, and shows low long-term model drift, indicating no need for frequent model re-training.

This study, we developed a practical BCI based on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) for continuous control of a quadcopter from the first-person perspective. Users watched with the video stream from a camera on the quadcopter. An innovative user interface was developed by embedding 12 SSVEP flickers into the video stream, which corresponded to the flight commands of 'take-off,' 'land,' 'hover,' 'keep-going,' 'clockwise,' 'counter-clockwise' and rectilinear motions in six directions, respectively. The command was updated every 400ms by decoding the collected EEG data using a combined classification algorithm based on task-related component analysis ( TRCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The quadcopter flew in the 3-D space according to the control vector that was determined by the latest four commands. Three novices participated in this study. They were asked to control the quadcopter by either the brain or hands to fly through a circle and land on the target zone. As a result, the time consumption ratio of brain-control to hand-control was as low as 1.34, which means the BCI performance was close to hands. The information transfer rate reached a peak of 401.79 bits/min in the simulated online experiment. These results demonstrate the proposed SSVEP-BCI system is efficient for controlling the quadcopter.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus in epileptic encephalopathies in childhood	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Review						Nonconvulsive status epilepticus; Epileptic encephalopathies; Childhood	MYOCLONIC-ASTATIC EPILEPSY; RING CHROMOSOME-20; INFANTILE SPASMS; ILAE COMMISSION; TERM PROGNOSIS; DOOSE-SYNDROME; WEST SYNDROME; EEG; HYPSARRHYTHMIA; CLASSIFICATION	Epileptic encephalopathies are conditions in which the abundant epileptiform activity itself interferes with development, resulting in cognitive slowing and often regression, psychiatric and behavioral disturbances. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus has been defined as ongoing or nonrecovering nonconvulsive seizures. It has been challenging to differentiate clinical and electroencephalographic patterns in epileptic encephalopathies from those attributed to nonconvulsive status epilepticus, since several different epileptic encephalopathies may show continuous or subcontinuous epileptiform activity. Especially for patients with known epileptic encephalopathy, the new proposal for diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus suggests an increase in prominence or frequency of specific electroencephalographic features as compared to baseline correlated to clinical and EEG responsiveness to intravenous anti-seizure drugs. This clinical change may be unclear, particularly in patients with pre-existent cognitive or behavioral impairments. This review intends to organize previously published data, with available information in the literature on some of those specific epileptic syndromes and diseases, focusing on two main questions: i. When should specialists suspect of nonconvulsive status epilepticus in epileptic encephalopathies? ii. Could epileptic encephalopathies themselves be nonconvulsive status epilepticus presentations? Lastly, the rationale for definition and treatment in many of the epileptic encephalopathies is the effect of ongoing frequent epileptiform activity on development and cognition, and this will require monitoring with serial clinical, neurophysiological, functional neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessments. Whether there would be an association or causality between epileptic encephalopathies and nonconvulsive status epilepticus is a key question demanding further research.	[Hamad, A.

However, most of existing shared controllers have paid less attention to the effects caused by subjects with different levels of brain control ability.Approach.In this paper, a brain state evaluation network, termed BSE-NET, is proposed to evaluate subjects' brain control ability online based on quantized attention-gated kernel reinforcement learning. With the output of BSE-NET (confidence score), a shared controller is designed to dynamically adjust the control weight between robot autonomy and human operator.Main results.The experimental results show that most of subjects achieved high and stable experimental success rate of approximately 90%. Furthermore, for subjects with different accuracy on EEG decoding, a proper confidence score can be dynamically generated to reflect their levels of brain control ability, and the proposed system can effectively adjust the control weight in all-time shared control.Significance.We discuss how our proposed method shows promise for BCI applications that can evaluate subjects' brain control ability online as well as provide a method for the research on self-adaptive shared control to adaptively balance control weight between subject's instruction and robot autonomy.

To elucidate these issues, we analyzed simultaneous SEEG recordings in HH and cortex systematically. Methods We retrospectively investigated data from 15 consecutive patients with SEEG electrodes into the HH for the treatment purpose of radiofrequency thermocoagulation treatment. Additional SEEG electrodes were placed into the cortex in 11 patients to assess extra-HH involvement. Interictal discharges within the HH and anatomo-electroclinical correlations during seizures of each patient were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Results Overall, 77 electrodes with 719 contacts were implanted, and 33 spontaneous seizures were recorded during long-term SEEG monitoring. Interictally, distinct electrophysiological patterns, including isolated intermittent spikes/sharp waves, burst spike and wave trains, paroxysmal fast discharges, periodic discharges, and high-frequency oscillations, were identified within the HH. Notably, synchronized or independent interictal discharges in the cortex were observed. Regarding the ictal discharges, the electrical onset pattern within the HH always started with abrupt giant shifts superimposed on low-voltage fast activity across patients. The gelastic seizure network mainly involved the HH, orbitofrontal areas, and cingulate gyrus. Seizures with automatisms and impaired awareness primarily propagated to mesial temporal lobes. Moreover, independent ictal discharges arising from the mesial temporal lobe were detected in three out of nine patients. Interpretation This study comprehensively reveals intrinsic electrophysiological patterns and epileptogenic networks in vivo, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cortical and subcortical epileptogenesis.

Neural oscillations reportedly comprise different functions depending on their own properties. Therefore, in this study, we investigated details of the complexity of neural oscillations by decomposing the oscillations into frequency, amplitude, and phase for AD patients. We applied resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) to 17 AD patients and 21 healthy control subjects. We first decomposed the source time series of the MEG signal into five intrinsic mode functions using ensemble empirical mode decomposition. We then analyzed the temporal complexities of these time series using multiscale entropy. Results demonstrated that AD patients had lower complexity on short time scales and higher complexity on long time scales in the alpha band in temporal regions of the brain. We evaluated the alpha band complexity further by decomposing it into amplitude and phase using Hilbert spectral analysis. Consequently, we found lower amplitude complexity and higher phase complexity in AD patients. Correlation analyses between spectral complexity and decomposed complexities revealed scale-dependency. Specifically, amplitude complexity was positively correlated with spectral complexity on short time scales, whereas phase complexity was positively correlated with spectral complexity on long time scales. Regarding the relevance of cognitive function to the complexity measures, the phase complexity on the long time scale was found to be correlated significantly with the Mini-Mental State Examination score. Additionally, we examined the diagnostic utility of the complexity characteristics using machine learning (ML) methods. We prepared a feature pool using multiple sparse autoencoders (SAEs), chose some discriminating features, and applied them to a support vector machine (SVM). Compared to the simple SVM and the SVM after feature selection (FS + SVM), the SVM with multiple SAEs (SAE + FS + SVM) had improved diagnostic accuracy. Through this study, we 1) advanced the understanding of neuronal complexity in AD patients using decomposed temporal complexity analysis and 2) demonstrated the effectiveness of combining ML methods with information about signal complexity for the diagnosis of AD.

This allows the robot to learn quasi-optimal routes to intended targets. We have combined the subclassification of two different types of navigational errors, with the subclassification of two different types of correct navigational actions, to create a 4-way classification strategy, providing detailed information about the type of action the robot performed. We used a 2-stage stepwise linear discriminant analysis approach, and tested this using brain signals from 8 and 14 participants observing two robot navigation tasks. Classification results were significantly above the chance level, with mean overall accuracy of 44.3% and 36.0% for the two datasets. As a proof of concept, we have shown that it is possible to perform fine-grained, 4-way classification of robot navigational actions, based on the electroencephalogram responses of participants who only had to observe the task. This study provides the next step towards comprehensive implicit brain-machine communication, and towards an efficient semi-autonomous brain-computer interface.

Tracking Your Mind's Eye during Recollection: Decoding the Long-Term Recall of Short Audiovisual Clips	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RECOGNITION MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES; REMEMBER/KNOW JUDGMENTS; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FAMILIARITY; RETRIEVAL; ERP; REPRESENTATIONS	Unlike familiarity, recollection involves the ability to reconstruct mentally previous events that results in a strong sense of reliving. According to the reinstatement hypothesis, this specific feature emerges from the reactivation of cortical patterns involved during information exposure. Over time, the retrieval of specific details becomes more difficult, and memories become increasingly supported by familiarity judgments. The multiple trace theory (MTT) explains the gradual loss of episodic details by a transformation in the memory representation, a view that is not shared by the standard consolidation model. In this study, we tested the MTT in light of the reinstatement hypothesis. The temporal dynamics of mental imagery from long-term memory were investigated and tracked over the passage of time. Participant EEG activity was recorded during the recall of short audiovisual clips that had been watched 3 weeks, 1 day, or a few hours beforehand. The recall of the audiovisual clips was assessed using a Remember/Know/New procedure, and snapshots of clips were used as recall cues. The decoding matrices obtained from the multivariate pattern analyses revealed sustained patterns that occurred at long latencies (>500 msec poststimulus onset) that faded away over the retention intervals and that emerged from the same neural processes. Overall, our data provide further evidence toward the MTT and give new insights into the exploration of our "mind's eye."

The decoding of ErrP has the potential to apply for Brain Computer System (BCI). Although various methods have been applied to the decoding of ErrPs, existing classification methods have room for improvement. Using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is a viable approach to ErrP classification but its performance can be compromised by insufficient training data being available. Using a form of generative adversarial network (GAN) enables data augmentation, which has offered significant performance improvement in a variety of fields such as signal processing, robotics, and unmanned vehicles. We therefore propose a novel approach to ErrP classification that combines GAN with DCNN to form a data-augmented DCNN. The proposed method has two main components: a GAN that offers data augmentation and a DCNN that performs the classification. We applied our method to the BNCI2020 dataset 22: Monitoring ErrPs, evaluating the results in terms of classification accuracy in various categories, including single-subject single-session, cross-subject single session, cross-session single-subject, and cross-subject cross-session versions for the entire dataset. The evaluations showed that the classification results had been improved comprehensively in comparison with existing published results. The maximum accuracy of the classification performance for the entire dataset reached 87%, which is 3% above the previous best result.

Genetic Background Influences Acute Response to TBI in Kindling-Susceptible, Kindling-Resistant, and Outbred Rats	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						TBI; electroencephalography; BDNF; genetic background; rat	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR BDNF; SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; MESSENGER-RNAS; TRKB; EXPRESSION; MORTALITY; EPILEPSY; EPILEPTOGENESIS; STIMULATION	We hypothesized that the acute response to traumatic brain injury (TBI) shares mechanisms with brain plasticity in the kindling model. Utilizing two unique, complementary strains of inbred rats, selected to be either susceptible or resistant to seizure-induced plasticity evoked by kindling of the perforant path, we examined acute electrophysiological alterations and differences in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein concentrations after a moderate-to-severe brain injury. At baseline, limited strain-dependent differences in acute electrophysiological activity were found, and no differences in BDNF. Following injury, pronounced strain-dependent differences in electrophysiologic activity were noted at 0.5 min. However, the divergence is transient, with diminished differences at 5 min after injury and no differences at 10 and 15 min after injury. Strain-specific differences in BDNF protein concentration were noted 4 h after injury. A simple risk score model generated by machine learning and based solely on post-injury electrophysiologic activity at the 0.5-min timepoint distinguished perforant path kindling susceptible (PPKS) rats from non-plasticity-susceptible strains. The findings demonstrate that genetic background which affects brain circuit plasticity also affects acute response to TBI. An improved understanding of the effect of genetic background on the cellular, molecular, and circuit plasticity mechanisms activated in response to TBI and their timecourse is key in developing much-needed novel therapeutic approaches.

Many users are unable to modulate their brain activity sufficiently in order to control a BCI. Most of the studies have been focusing on improving the accuracy of BCI control through advances in signal processing and BCI protocol modification. However, some research suggests that motor skills and physiological factors may affect BCI performance as well. Previous studies have indicated that there is differential lateralization of hand movements' neural representation in right- and left-handed individuals. However, the effects of handedness on sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) distribution and BCI control have not been investigated in detail yet. Our study aims to fill this gap, by comparing the SMR patterns during motor imagery and real-feedback BCI control in right- (N = 20) and left-handers (N = 20). The results of our study show that the lateralization of SMR during a motor imagery task differs according to handedness. Left-handers present lower accuracy during BCI performance (single session) and weaker SMR suppression in the alpha band (8-13 Hz) during mental simulation of left-hand movements. Consequently, to improve BCI control, the user's training should take into account individual differences in hand dominance.

In this regard, fNIRS signals of 20 healthy volunteers were recorded using a configuration of 23 channels located on the prefrontal cortex. The proposed deep learning system consists of two main parts where in the first part, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed to build informative activation maps, and then in the second part, a stack of deep fully connected layers is used to predict the stress existence probability. Thereafter, the employed CNN method is compared with the Dense Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest regarding various classification metrics. Results: Results clearly showed the superiority of CNN over all other methods. Additionally, the trained HRF model significantly outperforms the model trained on the filtered fNIRS signals, where the HRF model could achieve 98.69 +/- 0.45% accuracy, which is 10.09% greater than the accuracy obtained by the NIBS model. Conclusions: Employment of the proposed deep learning system trained on the HRF measurements leads to higher stress classification accuracy than the accuracy reported in the existing studies where the same experimental procedure has been done. Besides, the proposed method suggests better stability with lower variation in prediction. Furthermore, its low computational cost opens up the possibility to be applied in real-time monitoring of stress assessment.	[Hakimi, Naser; Jodeiri, Ata; Mirbagheri, Mahya; Setarehdan, S.

However, not many advancements have been made in allowing people with disabilities to control a robot in a remote location. Currently, people with disabilities are heavily underrepresented in the labor force. This paper presents the idea of using telepresence robots controlled by BCI in the workforce, providing the ability for a disabled individual to work in a wide variety of scenarios. This can be achieved by developing a system with 4 major components: Data Acquisition, Digital Signal Processing, Feature Extraction, and Classification. This work presents the preliminary results toward using traditional data acquisition, signal processing, feature extraction, and classification methods in order to control the primitive movements of a wheeled telepresence robot. The results show a promising classification accuracy of navigational direction for the telepresence robot. Future work will explore using state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition, signal processing, feature extraction, and classification to control a telepresence robot using a BCI headset, and other future work will also demonstrate the near real-time classification of BCI signals for robot control.

J	Hazra, D; Byun, YC				Hazra, Debapriya; Byun, Yung-Cheol			SynSigGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthetic Biomedical Signal Generation	BIOLOGY-BASEL			English	Article						biomedical signals; generative adversarial networks; synthetic data; health care; EEG; ECG; EMG; PPG		Simple Summary This paper proposes a novel generative adversarial networks model, SynSigGAN, to generate any kind of synthetic biomedical signals. The generation of synthetic signals eliminates confidentiality concerns and accessibility problem of medical data. Synthetic data can be utilized for training medical students and machine learning models for the advancement and automation of healthcare systems. Our proposed model performs significantly better than existing models with a high correlation coefficient that measures the generated synthetic signals' similarity with the original signals. Automating medical diagnosis and training medical students with real-life situations requires the accumulation of large dataset variants covering all aspects of a patient's condition. For preventing the misuse of patient's private information, datasets are not always publicly available. There is a need to generate synthetic data that can be trained for the advancement of public healthcare without intruding on patient's confidentiality. Currently, rules for generating synthetic data are predefined and they require expert intervention, which limits the types and amount of synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial networks (GAN) model, named SynSigGAN, for automating the generation of any kind of synthetic biomedical signals. We have used bidirectional grid long short-term memory for the generator network and convolutional neural network for the discriminator network of the GAN model. Our model can be applied in order to create new biomedical synthetic signals while using a small size of the original signal dataset. We have experimented with our model for generating synthetic signals for four kinds of biomedical signals (electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), photoplethysmography (PPG)). The performance of our model is superior wheen compared to other traditional models and GAN models, as depicted by the evaluation metric. Synthetic biomedical signals generated by our approach have been tested while using other models that could classify each signal significantly with high accuracy.

J	Lu, ZT; Ku, YX				Lu, Zitong; Ku, Yixuan			NeuroRA: A Python Toolbox of Representational Analysis From Multi-Modal Neural Data	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						representational similarity analysis (RSA); multivariate pattern analysis; multi-modal; Python; correlation analysis	PATTERN SIMILARITY; EEG; FMRI; ATTENTION; SOFTWARE; DYNAMICS; MODELS	In studies of cognitive neuroscience, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is widely used as it offers richer information than traditional univariate analysis. Representational similarity analysis (RSA), as one method of MVPA, has become an effective decoding method based on neural data by calculating the similarity between different representations in the brain under different conditions. Moreover, RSA is suitable for researchers to compare data from different modalities and even bridge data from different species. However, previous toolboxes have been made to fit specific datasets. Here, we develop NeuroRA, a novel and easy-to-use toolbox for representational analysis. Our toolbox aims at conducting cross-modal data analysis from multi-modal neural data (e.g., EEG, MEG, fNIRS, fMRI, and other sources of neruroelectrophysiological data), behavioral data, and computer-simulated data. Compared with previous software packages, our toolbox is more comprehensive and powerful. Using NeuroRA, users can not only calculate the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which reflects the representational similarity among different task conditions and conduct a representational analysis among different RDMs to achieve a cross-modal comparison. Besides, users can calculate neural pattern similarity (NPS), spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS), and inter-subject correlation (ISC) with this toolbox. NeuroRA also provides users with functions performing statistical analysis, storage, and visualization of results. We introduce the structure, modules, features, and algorithms of NeuroRA in this paper, as well as examples applying the toolbox in published datasets.

However, most non-muscular HRIs only produce discrete-valued commands, resulting in non-intuitive and less effective control of the dexterous assistive robotic arm. Furthermore, the user commands and the robot autonomy commands usually switch in the shared control strategies of such applications. This characteristic has been found to yield a reduced sense of agency as well as frustration for the user according to previous user studies. In this study, we firstly propose an intuitive and easy-to-learn-and-use hybrid HRI by combing the Brain-machine interface (BMI) and the gaze-tracking interface. For the proposed hybrid gaze-BMI, the continuous modulation of the movement speed via the motor intention occurs seamlessly and simultaneously to the unconstrained movement direction control with the gaze signals. We then propose a shared control paradigm that always combines user input and the autonomy with the dynamic combination regulation. The proposed hybrid gaze-BMI and shared control paradigm were validated for a robotic arm reaching task performed with healthy subjects. All the users were able to employ the hybrid gaze-BMI for moving the end-effector sequentially to reach the target across the horizontal plane while also avoiding collisions with obstacles. The shared control paradigm maintained as much volitional control as possible, while providing the assistance for the most difficult parts of the task. The presented semi-autonomous robotic system yielded continuous, smooth, and collision-free motion trajectories for the end effector approaching the target. Compared to a system without assistances from robot autonomy, it significantly reduces the rate of failure as well as the time and effort spent by the user to complete the tasks.

Methods: we use the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and the Skin Potential Response (SPR) signal, which has several advantages with respect to other Electrodermal (EDA) signals. We record one SPR signal for each hand, and use an algorithm that, selecting the smoother signal, is able to remove motion artifacts. We extract statistical features from the ECG and SPR signals in order to classify signal segments and identify the presence or absence of emotional events via a Supervised Learning Algorithm. The experiments were carried out in a company which specializes in driving simulator equipment, using a motorized platform and a driving simulator. Different subjects were tested with this setup, with different challenging events happening on predetermined locations on the track. Results: we obtain an Accuracy as high as 79.10% for signal blocks and as high as 91.27% for events. Conclusion: results demonstrate the good performance of the presented system in detecting sympathetic reactions, and the effectiveness of the motion artifact removal procedure. Significance: our work demonstrates the possibility to classify the emotional state of the driver, using the ECG and EDA signals and a slightly invasive setup. In particular, the proposed use of SPR and of the motion artifact removal procedure are crucial for the effectiveness of the system.

Modulations of oscillations in the alpha to beta range in task-relevant sensory regions have been suggested to play an important role for both mechanisms. We adapted a Sternberg task variant to the auditory modality, with a strong or a weak distracting sound presented at a predictable time during the retention period. Using a time-generalized decoding approach, relatively decreased strength of memorized information was found prior to strong distractors, paralleled by decreased pre-distractor alpha/beta power in the left superior temporal gyrus (ISTG). Over the entire group, reduced beta power in ISTG was associated with relatively increased strength of memorized information. The extent of alpha power modulations within participants was negatively correlated with strength of memorized information. Overall, our results are compatible with a prioritization account, but point to nuanced differences between alpha and beta oscillations.

TRCA is a data-driven method, in which spatial filters are optimized to maximize inter-trial covariance of time-locked electroencephalographic (EEG) data, formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem. Although multiple eigenvectors can be obtained by TRCA, the traditional TRCA-based SSVEP detection considered only one that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue to reduce its computational cost. This study proposes using multiple eigen-vectors to classify SSVEPs. Specifically, this study integrates a task consistency test, which statistically identifies whether the component reconstructed by each eigenvector is task-related or not, with the TRCA-based SSVEP detection method. The proposed method was evaluated by using a 12-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 10 subjects. The study results indicated that the task consistency test usually identified and suggested more than one eigenvectors (i.e., spatial filters). Further, the use of additional spatial filters significantly improved the classification accuracy of the TRCA-based SSVEP detection.

In this intervention, paretic stroke patients receive online feedback about their brain activity while conducting a motor-imagery (MI) task with the paretic limb. Typically, the feedback provided in NF-MIT protocols is an abstract visual signal based on a fixed trial. Here we developed a self-paced NF-MIT paradigm with an embodiable feedback signal (EFS), which was designed to resemble the content of the mental act as closely as possible. To this end, the feedback was delivered via an embodiable, anthropomorphic robotic hand (RH), which was integrated into a closed-looped EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Whenever the BCI identified a new instance of a hand-flexion or hand-extension imagination by the participant, the RH carried out the corresponding movement with minimum delay. Nine stroke patients and nine healthy participants were instructed to control RH movements as accurately as possible, using mental activity alone. We evaluated the general feasibility of our paradigm on electrophysiological, subjective and performance levels. Regarding electrophysiological measures, individuals showed the predicted event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns over sensorimotor brain areas. On the subjective level, we found that most individuals integrated the RH into their body scheme. With respect to RH control, none of our participants achieved a high level of control, but most managed to control the RH actions to some degree. Importantly, patients and controls achieved similar performance levels.

In the present article, we discuss which trends are likely to shape laterality research in the 2020s. These include, but are not limited to: (1) Finding laterality-specific solutions to the replication crisis. (2) Integrating non-W.E.I.R.D. (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) samples into laterality research to a larger extent. (3). Combining meta-analysis and large-scale databank studies to come to unbiased conclusions about true effects. (4) Understanding altered laterality in different psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. (5) Exploring the relevance of laterality research for the treatment of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. (6) Investigating the molecular correlates of environmental factors that affect laterality. (7) Bridging the gap between laterality research in human subjects and non-human model species. (8) Utilizing "next-generation" neuroimaging in laterality research. (9) Integrating graph-theory and machine learning into laterality research. (10) Enhancing ecological validity in laterality research using mobile EEG and smartphone-based data collection. These trends will likely shape the next decade of laterality research by opening the way for novel questions, enhancing collaborations and boosting the reliability and validity of research findings in our field.

Brain Activations and Functional Connectivity Patterns Associated with Insight-Based and Analytical Anagram Solving	BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Article						insight; Aha!-moment; fMRI; resting-state fMRI; functional connectivity; anagrams; creativity	CREATIVITY; PERFORMANCE; CLAUSTRUM; CORTEX; ORIGINS; PEOPLE; EEG; AHA	Insight is one of the most mysterious problem-solving phenomena involving the sudden emergence of a solution, often preceded by long unproductive attempts to find it. This seemingly unexplainable generation of the answer, together with the role attributed to insight in the advancement of science, technology and culture, stimulate active research interest in discovering its neuronal underpinnings. The present study employs functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe and compare the brain activations occurring in the course of solving anagrams by insight or analytically, as judged by the subjects. A number of regions were activated in both strategies, including the left premotor cortex, left claustrum, and bilateral clusters in the precuneus and middle temporal gyrus. The activated areas span the majority of the clusters reported in a recent meta-analysis of insight-related fMRI studies. At the same time, the activation patterns were very similar between the insight and analytical solutions, with the only difference in the right sensorimotor region probably explainable by subject motion related to the study design. Additionally, we applied resting-state fMRI to study functional connectivity patterns correlated with the individual frequency of insight anagram solutions. Significant correlations were found for the seed-based connectivity of areas in the left premotor cortex, left claustrum, and left frontal eye field. The results stress the need for optimizing insight paradigms with respect to the accuracy and reliability of the subjective insight/analytical solution classification. Furthermore, the short-lived nature of the insight phenomenon makes it difficult to capture the associated neural events with the current experimental techniques and motivates complementing such studies by the investigation of the structural and functional brain features related to the individual differences in the frequency of insight-based decisions.

Various applications of BCI have been stated in literature, and one of the most exciting areas which have not been extensively investigated is the field of multimedia. BCI can find huge potential in the area of command and control of video games. Video games have found huge potential for improving the gait and balance of people struggling with Parkinson's disease. Such systems make use of the brain signals which are captured through electrodes on scalp as electroencephalogram (EEG) or through implanted electrodes as electrocorticography (ECoG). The signals are then used as input commands to get desired output in an external device. To address the memory management issue arising due to the huge volume of ECoG data and to achieve distributed computation for improving the efficiency of BCI, the computations are implemented in Cloud. In this work, ECoG signals are pre-processed, and all features are extracted by using the wavelet packet transform (WPT), common spatial patterns (CSPs), Laplacian filter, and the Kalman filter. The Adaboost classifier was employed for ECoG signal classification.

Current practices for measuring cognitive load primarily rely on questionnaires that are subjective and disrupt surgical workflow. To address this limitation, a computational framework is demonstrated to predict user workload during telerobotic surgery. This framework leverages wireless sensors to monitor surgeons' cognitive load and predict their cognitive states. Continuous data across multiple physiological modalities (e.g., heart rate variability, electrodermal, and electroencephalogram activity) were simultaneously recorded for twelve surgeons performing surgical skills tasks on the validated da Vinci Skills Simulator. These surgical tasks varied in difficulty levels, e.g., requiring varying visual processing demand and degree of fine motor control. Collected multimodal physiological signals were fused using independent component analysis, and the predicted results were compared to the ground-truth workload level. Results compared performance of different classifiers, sensor fusion schemes, and physiological modality (i.e., prediction with single vs. multiple modalities). It was found that our multisensor approach outperformed individual signals and can correctly predict cognitive workload levels 83.2% of the time during basic and complex surgical skills tasks.

The main challenge is to identify the patient's motor intention based on large training datasets with noise contamination in the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. New method: To address this problem, this paper proposed a self-adaptively denoised Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD)-based motor intention recognition algorithm (DeERD) in order to enable BMI training with a small sample of calibration data. This study recruited 8 stroke patients. Each patient was required to execute paralyzed upper-limb motor attempt for 20 trials and remain in resting state for 20 trials randomly. ERD-based motor intention recognition algorithm, Common spatial filter algorithm (CSP) and Directed Transfer Function analysis (DTF) were used to extract features for classification respectively and compared with the proposed DeERD analysis. Results: DeERD can filter the noise and extract the average lines as the principal trends. With denoising processing, Accuracy (ACC) was up to 70% for all 8 patients and they could be included in this BMI system effectively. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed DeERD model generated statistically significant increase in True Positive Rate (TPR) and in ACC than the DTF model. TPR and ACC standard deviation of DeERD was smaller than that of CSP. Conclusions: The proposed DeERD model can eliminate the principal noise and extract the principal trend of the time-frequency analysis. It provides a practical method to recruit more stroke patients into BMI training with fewer calibration trainings.

Methods: SEEG signals, acquired from drug-resistant epilepsy patients during a visual naming task, were analyzed to find clusters of 50-150 Hz power modulations in time-frequency domain. Classifier models to identify electrode contacts within the reference neuroanatomy and electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) speech/language sites were developed and validated. Results: In 21 patients (9 females), aged 4.8-21.2 years, SEEG HGM model predicted electrode locations within Neurosynth language parcels with high diagnostic odds ratio (DOR 10.9, p < 0.0001), high specificity (0.85), and fair sensitivity (0.66). Another SEEG HGM model classified ESM speech/language sites with significant DOR (5.0, p < 0.0001), high specificity (0.74), but insufficient sensitivity. Time to largest power change reliably localized electrodes within Neurosynth language parcels, while, time to center-of mass power change identified ESM sites. Conclusions: SEEG HGM mapping can accurately localize neuroanatomic and ESM language sites. Significance: Predictive modelling incorporating time, frequency, and magnitude of power change is a useful methodology for task-related HGM, which offers insights into discrepancies between HGM language maps and neuroanatomy or ESM.

Previous work established that serotonergic psychedelics can have a dysregulating effect on brain activity, leading to subjective effects that present a considerable overlap with the phenomenology of certain meditative states. Here we propose that the prolonged practice of meditation results in endogenous increased entropy of brain oscillatory activity. We estimated the entropy of band-specific oscillations during the meditative state of traditions classified as 'focused attention' (Himalayan Yoga), 'open monitoring' (Vipassana), and 'open awareness' (Isha Shoonya Yoga). Among all traditions, Vipassana resulted in the highest entropy increases, predominantly in the alpha and low/high gamma bands. In agreement with previous studies, all meditation traditions increased the global coherence in the gamma band, but also stabilized gamma-range dynamics by lowering the metastability. Finally, machine learning classifiers could successfully generalize between certain pairs of meditation traditions based on the scalp distribution of gamma band entropies. Our results extend previous findings on the spectral changes observed during meditation, showing how long-term practice can lead to the capacity for achieving brain states of high entropy. This constitutes an example of an endogenous, self-induced high entropy state. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The diagnosis of the disease is made by the physician in two stages by examining the patient records taken with the polysomnography device. Because of the negative aspects of this process, new diagnostic processes and devices are needed. In this article, a new approach to sleep staging, which is one of the diagnostic steps of the disease, was proposed. An artificial intelligence-based sleep/awake system detection was developed for sleep staging processing. Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and heart rate variable (HRV) were used in the study. PPG records taken from patient and control groups were cleaned by the digital filter. The HRV parameter was then derived from the PPG signal. Then, 40 features from HRV signal and 46 features from PPG signal were extracted. The extracted features were classified by reduced machine learning techniques with F-score feature selection method. In order to evaluate the performances of the classifiers, the sensitivity and specificity values, the accuracy rates for each class were computed in the test set and receiver operating characteristic curve prepared. In addition, area under the curve (AUC), Kappa coefficient and F-score were calculated. According to the results obtained, the system can be realised with 91.09% accuracy rate using 11 PPG and HRV and with 90.01% accuracy rate using 14 HRV features. These success rates are quite enough for the system to work. When all these values are taken into consideration, it is possible to realise a practical sleep/awake detection system. This article suggests that the PPG signal can be used to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea by processing with artificial intelligence and signal processing techniques.

J	Levi-Aharoni, H; Tishby, N				Levi-Aharoni, Hadar; Tishby, Naftali			The value-complexity trade-off for reinforcement learning based brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain&#8211; computer interface; EEG; ErrP; noise; reinforcement learning; control information; complexity	ERROR-RELATED POTENTIALS; MOTOR IMAGERY; PERFORMANCE; SIGNALS; CORTEX	Objective. One of the recent developments in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is the reinforcement learning (RL) based BCI paradigm, which uses neural error responses as the reward feedback on the agent's action. While having several advantages over motor imagery based BCI, the reliability of RL-BCI is critically dependent on the decoding accuracy of noisy neural error signals. A principled method is needed to optimally handle this inherent noise under general conditions. Approach. By determining a trade-off between the expected value and the informational cost of policies, the info-RL (IRL) algorithm provides optimal low-complexity policies, which are robust under noisy reward conditions and achieve the maximal obtainable value. In this work we utilize the IRL algorithm to characterize the maximal obtainable value under different noise levels, which in turn is used to extract the optimal robust policy for each noise level. Main results. Our simulation results of a setting with Gaussian noise show that the complexity level of the optimal policy is dependent on the reward magnitude but not on the reward variance, whereas the variance determines whether a lower complexity solution is favorable or not. We show how this analysis can be utilized to select optimal robust policies for an RL-BCI and demonstrate its use on EEG data. Significance. We propose here a principled method to determine the optimal policy complexity of an RL problem with a noisy reward, which we argue is particularly useful for RL-based BCI paradigms. This framework may be used to minimize initial training time and allow for a more dynamic and robust shared control between the agent and the operator under different conditions.

The sensor component of a BCI circuit dictates the resolution of brain pattern recognition and therefore plays an integral role in the technology. Several sensor modalities are currently in use for BCI applications and are broadly either electrode-based or functional neuroimaging-based. Sensors vary in their inherent spatial and temporal resolutions, as well as in practical aspects such as invasiveness, portability, and maintenance. Hybrid BCI systems with multimodal sensory inputs represent a promising development in the field allowing for complimentary function. Artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms have been applied to BCI systems to achieve faster and more accurate classifications of sensory input and improve user performance in various tasks. Neurofeedback is an important advancement in the field that has been implemented in several types of BCI systems by showing users a real-time display of their recorded brain activity during a task to facilitate their control over their own cortical activity. In this way, neurofeedback has improved BCI classification and enhanced user control over BCI output. Taken together, BCI systems have progressed significantly in recent years in terms of accuracy, speed, and communication. Understanding the sensory components of a BCI is essential for neurosurgeons and clinicians as they help advance this technology in the clinical setting.

Breath analysis in detecting epilepsy	JOURNAL OF BREATH RESEARCH			English	Article						epilepsy; diagnosis; electronic nose; Aeonose(TM); breath analysis	ELECTRONIC NOSE; CHRONIC PAIN; EEG; AGE; PROFILE; GENDER; ILAE	The aim of this proof of concept study is to investigate if an electronic nose (eNose) is able to make a distinction between breath profiles of diagnosed epilepsy patients and epilepsy-free control subjects. An eNose is a non-invasive device, with a working mechanism that is based on the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. These VOCs interact with the sensors of the eNose, and the eNose has to be trained to distinguish between breath patterns from patients with a specific disease and control subjects without that disease. During the measurement participants were asked to breathe through the eNose for five minutes via a disposable mouthpiece. Seventy-four epilepsy patients and 110 control subjects were measured to train the eNose and create a classification model. To assess the effects of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) usage on the classification, additional test groups were measured: seven patients who (temporarily) did not use AEDs and 11 patients without epilepsy who used AEDs. The results show that an eNose is able to make a distinction between epilepsy and control subjects with a sensitivity of 76%, a specificity of 67%, and an accuracy of 71%. The results of the two additional groups of subjects show that the created model classifies one out of seven epilepsy patients without AEDs and six out of 13 patients without epilepsy but with AEDs correctly. In this proof of concept study, the Aeonose(TM) is able to differentiate between epilepsy patients and control subjects. However, the number of false positives and false negatives is still high, which suggests that this first model is still mainly based on the usage of various AEDs.

This issue may lead to variations in feature distribution of electroencephalogram (EEG) across subjects, which greatly reduces the generalization ability of a classifier. Although subject-dependent (SD) strategy provides a promising way to solve the problem of personalized classification, it cannot achieve expected performance due to the limitation of the amount of data especially for a deep neural network (DNN) classification model. Herein, we propose an instance transfer subject-independent (ITSD) framework combined with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve the classification accuracy of the model during motor imagery (MI) task. The proposed framework consists of the following steps. Firstly, an instance transfer learning based on the perceptive Hash algorithm is proposed to measure similarity of spectrogram EEG signals between different subjects. Then, we develop a CNN to decode these signals after instance transfer learning. Next, the performance of classifications by different training strategies (subject-independent- (SI-) CNN, SD-CNN, and ITSD-CNN) are compared. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, we evaluate it on the dataset of BCI competition IV-2b. Experiments show that the instance transfer learning can achieve positive instance transfer using a CNN classification model. Among the three different training strategies, the average classification accuracy of ITSD-CNN can achieve 94:7 +/- 2:6 and obtain obvious improvement compared with a contrast model (p < 0.01). Compared with other methods proposed in previous research, the framework of ITSD-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art classification methods with a mean kappa value of 0.664.

Methods: First, an iEMG signal is decimated to produce a set of "disjoint" downsampled signals, which are decomposed by the lifting wavelet transform (LWT). The Higuchi's fractal dimensions (FDs) of LWT coefficients in the subbands are computed. The FDs of LWT subband coefficients are fused with one-dimensional local binary pattern derived from each downsampled signal. Next, a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) determines the class labels of downsampled signals. Finally, the sequence of class labels is fed to the Boyer-Moore majority vote (BMMV) algorithm, which assigns a class to every iEMG signal. Results: The MLPNN-BMMV classifier was experimented with 250 iEMG signals belonging to three categories. The performance of the classifier was validated in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. The MLPNN-BMMV has resulted in impressive performance measures (%) using a 10-fold cross-validation-accuracy = 99.87 +/- 0.25, sensitivity (normal) = 99.97 +/- 0.13, sensitivity (myopathy) = 99.68 +/- 0.95, sensitivity (neuropathy) = 99.76 +/- 0.66, specificity (normal) = 99.72 +/- 0.61, specificity (myopathy) = 99.98 +/- 0.10, and specificity (neuropathy) = 99.96 +/- 0.14-surpassing the existing approaches. Conclusions: A future research direction is to validate the classifier performance with diverse iEMG datasets, which would lead to the design of an affordable real-time expert system for neuromuscular disorder diagnosis.

Methods In 328 adult patients with IGE, demographic data, imaging, EEG data, current and prior antiepileptic treatment, treatment outcome, and side effects were analyzed from the patients' medical files and patient interviews. Results Seizure freedom with acceptable side effects at the first attempt was achieved in 61 (18.6%) patients. One hundred four (31.7%) patients tried >= 3 antiepileptic drugs before achieving seizure control at the last follow-up. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and valproic acid showed differential response rates (39.8% vs 47.5% vs 71.1%) that were most pronounced in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The risk of having side effects was higher with valproic acid (23.7%) than with lamotrigine (10.4%) or levetiracetam (20.4%) treatment, contributing to the low retention rate of valproic acid (53.7%). Treatment resistance was associated with established risk factors. Multivariate analyses aiming at identifying clinical indicators for response to specific drugs did not reveal putative biomarkers when corrected for drug resistance. Conclusion Despite a high rate of seizure control, the chance of achieving seizure control and acceptable side effects at first attempt was low due to an inverse association of effectiveness and side effects of the 3 most commonly used drugs. Routinely assessed clinical parameters were not indicative for response to specific drugs. Classification of evidence This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with IGE, various clinical factors do not predict a response to specific antiepileptic drugs.

One major challenge is to understand how cortical circuits at drastically different spatial scales, from local networks to brain-scale networks, operate in concert to enable consciousness, and how those processes are impaired in DOC patients. In this review, we attempt to relate available neurophysiological and clinical data with existing theoretical models of consciousness, while linking the micro- and macrocircuit levels. First, we address the relationships between awareness and wakefulness on the one hand, and cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity on the other hand. Second, we discuss the role of three main types of GABAergic interneurons in specific circuits responsible for the dynamical reorganization of functional networks. Third, we explore advances in the functional role of nested oscillations for neural synchronization and communication, emphasizing the importance of the balance between local (high-frequency) and distant (low-frequency) activity for efficient information processing. The clinical implications of these theoretical considerations are presented. We propose that such cellular-scale mechanisms could extend current theories of consciousness.

If effective, this would be a valuable tool for the monitoring of personal QoE during video streaming services without asking the user to provide feedback, with great advantages for service management. Additionally, this would eliminate the bias of subjective tests and would avoid bothering the viewers with questions to collect opinions and feedback. The performed analysis relies on two different experiments: i) a crowdsourcing test, where the videos are subject to impairments caused by long initial delays and re-buffering events; ii) a laboratory test, where the videos are affected by blurring effects. The facial Action Units (AU) that represent the contractions of specific facial muscles together with the position of the eyes' pupils are extracted to identify the correlation between perceived quality and facial expressions. An SVM with a quadratic kernel and a k-NN classifier have been tested to predict the QoE from these features. These have also been combined with measured application-level parameters to improve the quality prediction. From the performed experiments, it results that the best performance is obtained with the k-NN classifier by combining all the described features and after training it with both the datasets, with a prediction accuracy as high as 93.9% outperforming the state of the art achievements.

J	Koyuncu, H				Koyuncu, Hasan			GM-CPSO: A New Viewpoint to Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization via Gauss Map	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Chaotic; Epileptic seizure; Gauss map; Hybrid classifier; Optimization; Pattern recognition		Chaos concept has been appealed in the recent optimization methods to achieve a convenient tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Different chaotic maps have been considered to find out the appropriate one for the system dynamics. However, on particle swarm optimization (PSO), the usage of these maps has not been handled in an extensive manner, and the best fit one has not known yet. In this paper, ten chaotic maps are handled to reveal the best fit one for PSO, and to explore whether chaotic maps are necessary for PSO or not. Thirteen benchmark functions are used to perform a detailed evaluation at the first experiment. Chaotic PSO (CPSO) methods including different maps are tested on global function optimization. Concerning this, Gauss map based CPSO (GM-CPSO) has come to the forefront by achieving promising fitness values in all function evaluations and in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. To test the efficiency of GM-CPSO on a different task, GM-CPSO is hybridized with neural network (NN) at the second experiment, and the epileptic seizure recognition is handled. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based features, GM-CPSO and NN are considered to design an efficient framework and to specify the type of electroencephalography signals. GM-CPSO-NN is compared with hybrid NNs including two state-of-the-art optimization methods so as to examine the efficiency of GM-CPSO. To accurately test the performances, twofold cross validation is realized on 11,500 instances, and four metrics [accuracy, area under ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity] are consulted for a detailed assessment beside of computational complexity analysis. In experiments, GM-CPSO including the necessary map, has provided remarkable fitness scores over the state-of-the-art optimization methods on optimization of various functions defined in different dimensions. Besides, the proposed framework including GM-CPSO-NN, has achieved remarkable performance by obtaining reliable accuracy (97.24%), AUC (95.67%), sensitivity (93.04%) and specificity (98.29%) scores, and by including less computational complexity than other algorithms. According to the results, GM-CPSO has arisen as the most convenient optimization method to be preferred in the formation of hybrid NNs. In addition to optimization and classification results, it's seen that the detail sub-bands of DWT comprise necessary information for seizure recognition. Consequently, it's revealed that GM-CPSO can be preferred on global function optimization for reliable convergence, and its usage can be extended to different disciplines like signal classification, pattern recognition or hybrid system design.

Stress detection using physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a traditional approach. However, the effect of stress on the EMG signal of different muscles and the efficacy of combination of the EMG and other biological signals for stress detection have not been taken into account yet. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the EMG signal of the right and left trapezius and right and left erector spinae muscles for multi-level stress recognition. Also, the ECG signal was employed to evaluate the efficacy of EMG signals for stress detection. Methods: Both EMG and ECG signals were acquired simultaneously from 34 healthy students (23 females and 11 males, aged 20-37 years). Mental arithmetic, Stroop color-word test, time pressure, and stressful environment were employed to induce stress in the laboratory. Results: The accuracies of stress recognition in two, three and four levels were 100%, 97.6%, and 96.2%, respectively, obtained from the distinct combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms. Conclusions: The comparison of stress detection accuracies resulted from EMG and ECG indicators demonstrated the strong ability and the effectiveness of EMG signal for multi-level stress detection.

Human stereoEEG recordings reveal network dynamics of decision-making in a rule-switching task	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							PERCEPTUAL DECISION; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; PARIETAL OPERCULUM; MOTOR CORTEX; MAPS; EEG; AREAS; INFORMATION; MECHANISM; TOOLBOX	The processing steps that lead up to a decision, i.e., the transformation of sensory evidence into motor output, are not fully understood. Here, we combine stereoEEG recordings from the human cortex, with single-lead and time-resolved decoding, using a wide range of temporal frequencies, to characterize decision processing during a rule-switching task. Our data reveal the contribution of rostral inferior parietal lobule (IPL) regions, in particular PFt, and the parietal opercular regions in decision processing and demonstrate that the network representing the decision is common to both task rules. We reconstruct the sequence in which regions engage in decision processing on single trials, thereby providing a detailed picture of the network dynamics involved in decision-making. The reconstructed timeline suggests that the supramarginal gyrus in IPL links decision regions in prefrontal cortex with premotor regions, where the motor plan for the response is elaborated. How sensory evidence is transformed into motor output is not fully understood. Here, the authors use stereoEEG recordings during a rule-switching task to reveal network dynamics of decision-making.

The present study aimed to compare the typical videogame "Power Solitaire" in both scenarios, real and virtual one, by monitoring presence by estimating the alpha power spectral density on 14 electroencephalographic channels. As well, it was used three questionnaires ("Immersive Tendencies", "Presence", and "Slater Usoh-Steed") to check the level of Presence. For this study, seven volunteers were recruited, and an Occulus Rift Headset and a headset "Emotiv epoc" were used. The study showed that "Power Solitaire" videogame rendered in VR mode induced the similar sense of presence experienced in the real world in accordance with (1) a good movement and auditory response of VR, (2) high quality of user-system interaction, and (3) similar level of alpha neural synchrony over the frontal lobe, which reflects sensory decoding, level of attention, and readiness to perform a task.

Recent findings Innovations in digital data storage and integration technology have motivated the active development of data-driven tools for neurocritical care practice. There has been progress towards harmonization of data dictionaries within the field to boost generalizability of studies. Numerous collaborative groups have cultivated datasets that will enable further study of disease detection, prediction, and management of critically ill neurologic patients. Essential to the effective analysis of big data in neurocritical care are the increasing relationships between clinicians and data scientists. There are multiple challenges related to the efficient and ethical use of big data, including data complexity, database stewardship and governance, data quality, and safe implementation of data-driven conclusions. Continued efforts towards optimally harnessing data will be crucial in neurocritical care. Critically ill neurologic patients generate an abundant amount of data in the course of routine management. Clinical research is evolving from benefiting the "average patient" to aiming to deliver more precise treatment to the individual patient. In neurocritical care, this has manifested through big data-for triage decisions, enhancing workflow, event detection, and outcome prediction.

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a reflection of medically unexplained physical symptoms that lead to distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning. SSD is phenomenologically diagnosed and its neurobiology remains unsolved. Approach. In this study, we performed hyper-parameter optimized classification to distinguish 19 persistent SSD patients and 21 healthy controls by utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy via performing two painful stimulation experiments, individual pain threshold (IND) and constant sub-threshold (SUB) that include conditions with different levels of pain (INDc and SUBc) and brush stimulation. We estimated a dynamic functional connectivity time series by using sliding window correlation method and extracted features from these time series for these conditions and different cortical regions. Main results. Our results showed that we found highest specificity (85%) with highest accuracy (82%) and 81% sensitivity using an SVM classifier by utilizing connections between right superior temporal-left angular gyri, right middle frontal (MFG)-left supramarginal gyri and right middle temporal- left middle frontal gyri from the INDc condition. Significance. Our results suggest that fNIRS may distinguish subjects with SSD from healthy controls by applying pain in levels of individual pain-threshold and bilateral MFG, left inferior parietal and right temporal gyrus might be robust biomarkers to be considered for SSD neurobiology.

If related tomood disorders, anxiety can trigger or escalate other symptoms and affects mental diseases, akin depression, and suicidal behavior. Recent works have shown that binaural beats are able to reduce anxiety and modify other psychological conditions, significantly changing cognitive processes and mood states. They can be defined as a low-frequency acoustic stimuli perceived when a given individual is subjected to two marginally different wave frequencies, from 200 to 900 Hz. In the present work, we applied a 5 Hz binaural beat to 6 different subjects, to detect if relevant changes could be noticed in their brain waves after the stimuli. Twenty minutes stimuli in ten separate sessions were applied. In order to detect these possible differences, we used a single hidden layer Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network and compared its results to non-parametric statistical tests and Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA). Results obtained on eLORETA point to a strong increase in the current distribution, mostly in the Alpha 2 band, at the Anterior Cingulate, pertinent to the recognition and expression of emotions, as well as the monitoring of mistakes regarding social conduct.

Since words are by definition expressed by sound, factoring out syntactic information is normally impossible. Here, we circumvented this problem in a novel way by designing phrases with exactly the same acoustic content but different syntactic structures depending on the other words they occur with. In particular, we used phrases merging an article with a noun yielding a Noun Phrase (NP) or a clitic with a verb yielding a Verb Phrase (VP). We performed stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in epileptic patients. We measured a different electrophysiological correlates of verb phrases vs. noun phrases in multiple cortical areas in both hemispheres, including language areas and their homologous in the non-dominant hemisphere. The high gamma band activity (150-300Hz frequency), which plays a crucial role in inter-regional cortical communications, showed a significant difference during the presentation of the homophonous phrases, depending on whether the phrase was a verb phrase or a noun phrase. Our findings contribute to the ultimate goal of a complete neural decoding of linguistic structures from the brain.

Neonatal encephalopathy clinical trials: developing the future	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED EEG; WHOLE-BODY HYPOTHERMIA; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; BRAIN-INJURY; CEREBRAL AUTOREGULATION; NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION; CEREBROVASCULAR AUTOREGULATION; NEURODEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES; TERM INFANTS	The next phase of clinical trials in neonatal encephalopathy (NE) focuses on hypothermia adjuvant therapies targeting alternative recovery mechanisms during the process of hypoxic brain injury. Identifying infants eligible for neuroprotective therapies begins with the clinical detection of brain injury and classification of severity. Combining a variety of biomarkers (serum, clinical exam, EEG, movement patterns) with innovative clinical trial design and analyses will help target infants with the most appropriate and timely treatments. The timing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopy after NE both assists in identifying the acute perinatal nature of the injury (days 3-7) and evaluates the full extent and evolution of the injury (days 10-21). Early, intermediate outcome of neuroprotective interventions may be best defined by the 21-day neuroimaging, with recognition that the full neurodevelopmental trajectory is not yet defined. An initial evaluation of each new therapy at this time point may allow higher-throughput selection of promising therapies for more extensive investigation. Functional recovery can be assessed using a trajectory of neurodevelopmental evaluations targeted to a prespecified and mechanistically derived hypothesis of drug action. As precision medicine revolutionizes healthcare, it should also include the redesign of NE clinical trials to allow safe, efficient, and targeted therapeutics. Impact As precision medicine revolutionizes healthcare, it should also include the redesign of NE clinical trials to allow faster development of safe, effective, and targeted therapeutics. This article provides a multidisciplinary perspective on the future of clinical trials in NE; novel trial design; study management and oversight; biostatistical methods; and a combination of serum, imaging, and neurodevelopmental biomarkers can advance the field and improve outcomes for infants affected by NE. Innovative clinical trial designs, new intermediate trial end points, and a trajectory of neurodevelopmental evaluations targeted to a prespecified and mechanistically derived hypothesis of drug action can help address common challenges in NE clinical trials and allow for faster selection and validation of promising therapies for more extensive investigation.

We aimed to explore an objective and quantitative color vision testing method based on sweep steady-state visual evoked potentials (sweep SSVEPs) and compare the results with subjective Farnsworth-Munsell (FM) 100-hue test results. Methods A red-green SSVEP pattern reversal checkboard paradigm at different luminance ratios was used to induce visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from 15 color vision deficiencies (CVDs) and 11 normal color vision subjects. After electroencephalography signals were processed by canonical correlation analysis, an equiluminance turning curve corresponding to the activation of theL-cones andM-cones at different levels of color vision was established. Then, we obtained different equiluminanceTand proposed the SSVEP color vision severity index (I-CVD) to quantify color vision function and the severity of CVDs. In addition, the FM 100-hue test was used to obtain subjective data for the diagnosis of color vision. Results The value ofI(CVD)can be an indicator of the level of color vision. Both the total error scores (TES) and confusion index (C-index) of the FM 100-hue test were significantly correlated withI(CVD)values (P < 0.001, respectively).I(CVD)also had a good classification effect in detecting normals, anomalous trichromats and dichromats. Moreover, equiluminanceThad a good effect on classifying protans and deutans in subjects with CVDs. Conclusion Color vision evaluation with sweep SSVEPs showed a good correlation with subjective psychophysical methods. SSVEPs can be an objective and quantitative method to test color vision and diagnose CVDs.

The Role of the Control Framework for Continuous Teleoperation of a Brain-Machine Interface-Driven Mobile Robot	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS			English	Article						Decoding; Electroencephalography; Task analysis; Mobile robots; Navigation; Performance evaluation; Brain-machine interface (BMI); control framework; motor imagery (MI); neurorobotics	COMPUTER INTERFACES; AUTONOMOUS ROBOTICS; ACTUATED WHEELCHAIR; MOTOR IMAGERY; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Despite the growing interest in brain-machine interface (BMI)-driven neuroprostheses, the translation of the BMI output into a suitable control signal for the robotic device is often neglected. In this article, we propose a novel control approach based on dynamical systems that was explicitly designed to take into account the nature of the BMI output that actively supports the user in delivering real-valued commands to the device and, at the same time, reduces the false positive rate. We hypothesize that such a control framework would allow users to continuously drive a mobile robot and it would enhance the navigation performance. 13 healthy users evaluated the system during three experimental sessions. Users exploit a 2-class motor imagery BMI to drive the robot to five targets in two experimental conditions: with a discrete control strategy, traditionally exploited in the BMI field, and with the novel continuous control framework developed herein. Experimental results show that the new approach: 1) allows users to continuously drive the mobile robot via BMI; 2) leads to significant improvements in the navigation performance; and 3) promotes a better coupling between user and robot. These results highlight the importance of designing a suitable control framework to improve the performance and the reliability of BMI-driven neurorobotic devices.

Presently, the antemortem identification of both PrPSc types in sCJD is not possible. In this study, we attempted to clinically predict the concurrence of MM-type sCJD with another PrPSc type in the same individual. We retrospectively identified seven MM-type sCJD cases with both fine vacuole-type spongiform (FV) and large confluent vacuole-type spongiform change (LCV) among 49 sCJD cases. We reviewed clinical features, pathological findings, and radiological abnormalities in these seven cases. We also conducted a regional systemic study with five brains to associate the spongiform-change pattern with hyperintensity on magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using the signal intensity index (SII). In the case series study, the one patient with dominant LCV showed longer disease duration, later onset of typical symptoms, no periodic sharp wave complexes in electroencephalography, and negative 14-3-3 protein findings compared to the six FV-dominant patients. LCV-dominant lesions tended to show higher intensity on DWI than did the FV-dominant lesions in respective patients. In the regional systemic study, LCV-dominant regions showed significantly higher SII on DWI than did the FV-dominant regions. In conclusion, mixed MM-type sCJD generally showed the clinical features of the phenotype that was dominant in pathological distribution. The SII may be clinically useful for investigating the concurrence of PrPSc type 2 in cases with the typical clinical course of MM1-type sCJD.

However, the pathophysiology of the gene mutations is far from clear. Here we report a novel SLC6A1 missense mutation in a patient with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder and characterized the molecular defects of the mutant GAT-1, from transporter protein trafficking to GABA uptake function in heterologous cells and neurons. The heterozygous missense mutation (c1081C to A (P361T)) in SLC6A1 was identified by exome sequencing. We have thoroughly characterized the molecular pathophysiology underlying the clinical phenotypes. We performed EEG recordings and autism diagnostic interview. The patient had neurodevelopmental delay, absence epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, and 2.5-3 Hz generalized spike and slow waves on EEG recordings. The impact of the mutation on GAT-1 function and trafficking was evaluated by H-3 GABA uptake, structural simulation with machine learning tools, live cell confocal microscopy and protein expression in mouse neurons and nonneuronal cells. We demonstrated that the GAT-1(P361T) mutation destabilizes the global protein conformation and reduces total protein expression. The mutant transporter protein was localized intracellularly inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with a pattern of expression very similar to the cells treated with tunicamycin, an ER stress inducer. Radioactive H-3-labeled GABA uptake assay indicated the mutation reduced the function of the mutant GAT-1(P361T), to a level that is similar to the cells treated with GAT-1 inhibitors. In summary, this mutation destabilizes the mutant transporter protein, which results in retention of the mutant protein inside cells and reduction of total transporter expression, likely via excessive endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation. This thus likely causes reduced functional transporter number on the cell surface, which then could cause the observed reduced GABA uptake function. Consequently, malfunctioning GABA signaling may cause altered neurodevelopment and neurotransmission, such as enhanced tonic inhibition and altered cell proliferation in vivo. The pathophysiology due to severely impaired GAT-1 function may give rise to a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes including autism and epilepsy.

They have difficulty in understanding other feelings and their own emotions. This leads to the sudden emotional outburst and aggressive behavior in these children. Parents, caretakers and doctors find it very difficult to prevent such extreme behaviors. Learning the positive and negative valence leads in determining the early indications before the onset of emotional outbursts in children with ASD. The present study measures the psycho physiological electrocardiogram (ECG) signal from the typically developed (TD) children and children with ASD in the age group of 5-11 years. Personalized protocol was developed for every child with ASD to induce positive and negative valence and ECG data was collected using wearable Shimmer ECG device. The heart rate variability (HRV) and the QRS amplitude were derived from ECG signal using Pan-Tompkins algorithm and eleven features were extracted using DWT (db2, db4 and db8) mother wavelet. The significant features of ECG, HRV and QRS amplitude were classified using the K nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and ensemble classifier. Ensemble and KNN classifier achieved maximum accuracy of 81% and 76.2% for children with ASD and Ensemble and SVM classifiers obtained maximum accuracy of 87.4% and 83.8% for TD children using HRV data.

Modern genomic technologies have revealed a number of monogenic origins and opened the door to therapeutic hopes. Here we describe a new syndromic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in GAD1, as presented by 11 patients from six independent consanguineous families. Seizure onset occurred in the first 2 months of life in all patients. All 10 patients, from whom early disease history was available, presented with seizure onset in the first month of life, mainly consisting of epileptic spasms or myoclonic seizures. Early EEG showed suppression-burst or pattern of burst attenuation or hypsarrhythmia if only recorded in the post-neonatal period. Eight patients had joint contractures and/or pes equinovarus. Seven patients presented a cleft palate and two also had an omphalocele, reproducing the phenotype of the knockout Gad1(-/-) mouse model. Four patients died before 4 years of age. GAD1 encodes the glutamate decarboxylase enzyme GAD67, a critical actor of the c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism as it catalyses the decarboxylation of glutamic acid to form GABA. Our findings evoke a novel syndrome related to GAD67 deficiency, characterized by the unique association of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, cleft palate, joint contractures and/or omphalocele.

BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Music; Voice; Emotion; Timecourse; ERPs	VOICE; SPEECH; COMMUNICATION; VOCALIZATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SOUND	From a baby's cry to a piece of music, we perceive emotions from our auditory environment every day. Many theories bring forward the concept of common neural substrates for the perception of vocal and musical emotions. It has been proposed that, for us to perceive emotions, music recruits emotional circuits that evolved for the processing of biologically relevant vocalizations (e.g., screams, laughs). Although some studies have found similarities between voice and instrumental music in terms of acoustic cues and neural correlates, little is known about their processing timecourse. To further understand how vocal and instrumental emotional sounds are perceived, we used EEG to compare the neural processing timecourse of both stimuli type expressed with a varying degree of complexity (vocal/musical affect bursts and emotion-embedded speech/music). Vocal stimuli in general, as well as musical/vocal bursts, were associated with a more concise sensory trace at initial stages of analysis (smaller N1), although vocal bursts had shorter latencies than the musical ones. As for the P2 - vocal affect bursts and Emotion-Embedded Musical stimuli were associated with earlier P2s. These results support the idea that emotional vocal stimuli are differentiated early from other sources and provide insight into the common neurobiological underpinnings of auditory emotions.

However, due to its no well-designed standard tactile vibration stimulator to elicit the SSSEP, the SSSEP-based BCI has not been widely used to real-world applications. In this study, we aim to SSSEP-based BCI with high-frequency vibration stimuli. In our experiments, the stimuli were constructed using the coin vibration motor which controlled by the Arduino. The feasibility of the high-frequency vibration stimuli to elicit SSSEP was validated with SSSEP data from two healthy participants. For data collection, the vibration stimuli were attached on the index finger of the left and right hand. And the participant concentrated on one of the vibration stimuli following the visual commands. For the data analysis, the spatial features were extracted from the acquired EEG signals using the common spatial pattern (CSP) filtering. The regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) also used as a classifier. The experimental results showed that the user's selective attention to one of the high-frequency vibration stimuli was classified with averaged 61.7 +/- 9.4%. Based on the experimental results, we can conclude that the SSSEP can elicit by the high-frequency vibration stimuli and it can be used to the BCI.

However, effective cardiac auscultation requires trained physicians whose work is tough, laborious and subjective. The objective of this study is to develop an automatic classification method for anomaly (normal vs. abnormal) detection of PCG recordings without any segmentation of heart sound signals. Hybrid signal processing and artificial intelligence tools, including tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR) and neural networks, are utilized to extract representative features in order to model, identify and detect abnormal patterns in the dynamics of PCG system caused by heart disease. First, heart sound signal is decomposed into a set of frequency subbands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method. Second, VMD is employed to decompose the subband of the heart sound signal into different intrinsic modes, in which the first four intrinsic modes contain the majority of the heart sound signal's energy and are considered to be the predominant intrinsic modes. They are selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Third, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear PCG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional PSR together with Euclidean distance has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in PCG system dynamics between normal and abnormal heart sound signals. Finally, PhysioNet/CinC Challenge heart sound database is used for evaluation and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique method is applied to balance the datasets. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed features with dynamical neural networks based classifier yield classification performance with sensitivity, specificity, overall score and accuracy values of 97.73% 98.05%, 97.89%, and 97.89%, respectively. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method which can serve as a potential candidate for the automatic anomaly detection in the clinical application.

Its automatic identification from physiological recordings can be extremely useful to prevent concomitant physical health problems as well as other mental disorders. However, this task is still an unresolved challenge. Recently, quadratic sample entropy (QSE) applied to the electroencephalogram signal has proven to be the most promising single metric to discern between emotional states of calm and negative stress. This index estimates repetitive patterns in a time series without considering time data order within each one, thus ignoring some relevant dynamics. Hence, in this work conditional entropy (CEn) and its correction (CCEn) are studied to complement and improve QSE ability in detection of distress. Both CEn and CCEn symbolize original time series to consider ordinal patterns and, thus, quantify accurately data predictability. Results obtained from 279 samples (146 associated with calm and 133 to distress) provide a similar discriminant power, about 65%, both for conditional entropies and QSE. More interestingly, these metrics also reveal the presence of complementary brain dynamics under a emotional state of distress. Thus, CCEn and QSE suggest a synchronization between opposite frontal and parietal brain regions from both hemispheres, such that when the level of negative stress increases, a more irregular activity is found in left frontal and right parietal areas. Simultaneously, more predictable activity is noticed in right frontal and left parietal regions. These findings agree with previous neurophysiological studies and allow to improve the identification of distress. Precisely, a very simple discriminant model based on CCEn and QSE is able to discern more than 80% of samples, thus overcoming slightly the results reported by previous works, where dozens or hundreds of variables have to be combined with advanced classifiers.

However, it is not applicable when studying neural entrainment to speech stimuli, in which stimuli are presented only once. Alternatively, multiple subjects' neural responses to the same stimuli can be averaged to decrease unexpected noises caused by breathing, lack of attentiveness etc., excluding those caused by heartbeats and blinking during long auditory tasks. However, individual differences such as varying latency times of the neural response to the stimulus and electrode positioning in the setup reduce the effectiveness of this method. To eliminate individual differences, we first estimated the importance (weight) of each electrode using a spatial filter and maximized the SNR by adjusting the latency of the neural response. Then we extracted the common response for all subjects and constructed neural entrainment models accordingly. The correlations between the predicted and actual neural responses obtained in this study were much higher than that in other methods in the forward neural encoding process. In the decoding process, the correlation between the reconstructed speech envelope and the original also increased significantly in both the delta and theta bands compared with previous studies.

While recent work has suggested that cognitive control can act upon WM guidance of visual attention, little is known about how the state of memorized items retaining in WM contribute to its influence over attention. Here, we disentangle the role of inhibition and maintenance on WM-guided attention with a novel delayed match-to-sample dual-task. The results showed that active inhibition facilitated searching by diminishing sensory processing and deterring attentional guidance, indexed by an attenuated P1 amplitude and unaffected N2pc amplitude, respectively. By contrast, active maintenance impaired searching by attentional guidance while sensory processing remained unimpaired, indexed by an enhanced N2pc amplitude and unchanged P1 amplitude, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate pattern analyses could sucessfully decode maintenance and inhibition, suggesting that two states differed in modulating visual attention. We propose that remembered contents may play an anchoring role for attentional guidance, and the state of those contents retaining in WM may directly influence the shifting of attention. The maintenance could guide attention by accessing input information, while the inhibition could deter the shifting of attention by suppressing sensory processing. These findings provide a possible reinterpretation of the influence of WM on attention.

Auditory Measures for the Next Billion Users	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Audiology; Auditory attention decoding; EEG; HRTF; Listening effort; MEG; PSAP; Speech enhancement; Speech recognition		A range of new technologies have the potential to help people, whether traditionally considered hearing impaired or not. These technologies include more sophisticated personal sound amplification products, as well as real-time speech enhancement and speech recognition. They can improve user's communication abilities, but these new approaches require new ways to describe their success and allow engineers to optimize their properties. Speech recognition systems are often optimized using the word-error rate, but when the results are presented in real time, user interface issues become a lot more important than conventional measures of auditory performance. For example, there is a tradeoff between minimizing recognition time (latency) by quickly displaying results versus disturbing the user's cognitive flow by rewriting the results on the screen when the recognizer later needs to change its decisions. This article describes current, new, and future directions for helping billions of people with their hearing. These new technologies bring auditory assistance to new users, especially to those in areas of the world without access to professional medical expertise. In the short term, audio enhancement technologies in inexpensive mobile forms, devices that are quickly becoming necessary to navigate all aspects of our lives, can bring better audio signals to many people. Alternatively, current speech recognition technology may obviate the need for audio amplification or enhancement at all and could be useful for listeners with normal hearing or with hearing loss. With new and dramatically better technology based on deep neural networks, speech enhancement improves the signal to noise ratio, and audio classifiers can recognize sounds in the user's environment. Both use deep neural networks to improve a user's experiences. Longer term, auditory attention decoding is expected to allow our devices to understand where a user is directing their attention and thus allow our devices to respond better to their needs. In all these cases, the technologies turn the hearing assistance problem on its head, and thus require new ways to measure their performance.

However, the potential of mfSSVEPs for command control has not been fully explored yet. It is significant to detect single-trial mfSSVEPs and establish a brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This study designed a stimulating paradigm that contains 32 targets, with each target composed of five fan-shaped flickers in a circle. The five flickers were modulated by five frequencies and formed a five-bit binary encoding system through controlling the ON/OFF state of each flicker. Twelve subjects participated in an offline and an online experiments. Inter-task-related component analysis (iTRCA) combined with a probabilistic model was proposed for target recognition. Notably, the training data needed for calibration corresponded to only six out of the 32 targets. It was found that the increasing number of flickers showed a negative impact on the mfSSVEP signal. The accuracy reached 80.9% +/- 11.7% on average with a peak of 95.3% by iTRCA, which was significantly higher than that by a traditional method. The results indicate that the proposed stimulation and algorithm are effective for encoding and decoding BCI commands. Therefore, the mfSSVEP-based BCI enables the augmentation of the BCI instruction set without any burden of collecting extra training data.

Seizure forecasting and cyclic control of seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						circadian rhythms; epilepsy; multiday rhythms; seizure cycles; seizure forecast; seizure prediction	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; ECG ABNORMALITIES; LONG-TERM; BRAIN-STIMULATION; PREDICTION; PATIENT; SLEEP; ONSET; PRECIPITANTS	Epilepsy is a unique neurologic condition characterized by recurrent seizures, where causes, underlying biomarkers, triggers, and patterns differ across individuals. The unpredictability of seizures can heighten fear and anxiety in people with epilepsy, making it difficult to take part in day-to-day activities. Epilepsy researchers have prioritized developing seizure prediction algorithms to combat episodic seizures for decades, but the utility and effectiveness of prediction algorithms has not been investigated thoroughly in clinical settings. In contrast, seizure forecasts, which theoretically provide the probability of a seizure at any time (as opposed to predicting the next seizure occurrence), may be more feasible. Many advances have been made over the past decade in the field of seizure forecasting, including improvements in algorithms as a result of machine learning and exploration of non-EEG-based measures of seizure susceptibility, such as physiological biomarkers, behavioral changes, environmental drivers, and cyclic seizure patterns. For example, recent work investigating periodicities in individual seizure patterns has determined that more than 90% of people have circadian rhythms in their seizures, and many also experience multiday, weekly, or longer cycles. Other potential indicators of seizure susceptibility include stress levels, heart rate, and sleep quality, all of which have the potential to be captured noninvasively over long time scales. There are many possible applications of a seizure-forecasting device, including improving quality of life for people with epilepsy, guiding treatment plans and medication titration, optimizing presurgical monitoring, and focusing scientific research. To realize this potential, it is vital to better understand the user requirements of a seizure-forecasting device, continue to advance forecasting algorithms, and design clear guidelines for prospective clinical trials of seizure forecasting.

Only a handful of metrics have been applied to CCEP data to infer connectivity, and no comparison as to which is best has been performed. New method: We implement a novel method which involved superimposing synthetic cortical responses onto stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) data, and use this to compare several metric's ability to detect the simulated patterns. In this we compare two commonly employed metrics currently used in CCEP analysis against eight time series similarity metrics (TSSMs), which have been widely used in machine learning and pattern matching applications. Results: Root Mean Square (RMS), a metric commonly employed in CCEP analysis, was sensitive to a wide variety of response patterns, but insensitive to simulated epileptiform patterns. Autoregressive (AR) coefficients calculated by Burg's method were also sensitive to a wide range of patterns, but were extremely sensitive to epileptiform patterns. Other metrics which employed elastic warping techniques were less sensitive to the simulated response patterns. Comparison with existing methods: Our study is the first to compare CCEP connectivity metrics against one-another. Our results found that RMS, which has been used in many CCEP studies previously, was the most sensitive metric across a wide range of patterns. Conclusions: Our novel method showed that RMS is a robust and sensitive measure, validating much of the findings of the SEEG-CCEP literature to date. Autoregressive coefficients may also be a useful metric to investigate epileptic networks.

The proposed BCI exploits the P300 signal, an event-related potential (ERP) typically induced by visual/audio oddball paradigm stimulation protocol. For the driving purpose, in our application a four-choice synchronous BCI has been implemented. The neural interface architecture is made up by (i) the acquisition unit, (ii) the processing unit and (iii) the navigation unit. The former unit collects brain signals by 6 smart wireless electrodes from the parietal-cortex area. The processing unit is composed of a dedicated mu PC (Raspberry Pi, RPi) performing stimuli delivery, the machine learning (ML) stage and the real-time classification. Specifically, the processing unit bases its ML stage working on a typical classification problem approach (i.e., feature extraction and classification). In this context, the main contribution of the work lies in the introduction of a P300 spatio-temporal characterization approach (t-RIDE), which allows to analyze all the available choices in a one-vs-all discrimination scenarios. It permits the implementation of very common binary classifiers despite the hyper dimensionality of the classification problem. Finally, the RPi-based navigation unit actuates the received commands and supports the vehicle by using peripheral sensors. As a proof of concept, the BCI operation has been tested on 7 subjects (aged 26 +/- 3), using an acrylic prototype car. The experimental results showed that in the online free-drive mode (testing set), the BCI accuracy reached 84.28 +/- 0.87% all over 4 choices, on singletrials.

As the etiology and clinical symptoms are complicated, differential diagnosis of TLE mainly relies on experienced clinicians, and specific diagnostic biomarkers remain unclear. Though great effort has been made regarding the genetics, pathology, and neuroimaging of TLE, an accurate and effective diagnosis of TLE, especially the TLE subtypes, remains an open problem. It is of a great importance to explore the brain network of TLE, since it can provide the basis for diagnoses and treatments of TLE. To this end, in this paper, we proposed a multi-head self-attention model (MSAM). By integrating the self-attention mechanism and multilayer perceptron method, the MSAM offers a promising tool to enhance the classification of TLE subtypes. In comparison with other approaches, including convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), experimental results on our collected MEG dataset show that the MSAM achieves a supreme performance of 83.6% on accuracy, 90.9% on recall, 90.7% on precision, and 83.4% on F1-score, which outperforms its counterparts. Furthermore, effectiveness of varying head numbers of multi-head self-attention is assessed, which helps select the optimal number of multi-head. The self-attention aspect learns the weights of different signal locations which can effectively improve classification accuracy. In addition, the robustness of MSAM is extensively assessed with various ablation tests, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach.

However, previous studies have investigated network topologies for the entire brain. In this study, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to investigate functional intra-hemispheric networks of healthy controls (HCs) and patients with left- or right-hemispheric temporal lobe or temporal plus extra-temporal lobe epilepsy. 22 HCs, 25 left patients (LPs), and 16 right patients (RPs) were enrolled. The debiased weighted phase lag index was used to calculate functional connectivity between 246 brain regions in six frequency bands. Global efficiency, characteristic path length, and transitivity were computed for left and right intra-hemispheric networks. The right global graph measures (GGMs) in the theta band were significantly different (p < .005) between RPs and both LPs and HCs. Right and left GGMs in higher frequency bands were significantly different (p < .05) between HCs and the patients. Right GGMs were used as input features of a Naive-Bayes classifier to classify LPs and RPs (78.0% accuracy) and all three groups (75.5% accuracy). The complete theta band brain networks were compared between LPs and RPs with network-based statistics (NBS) and with the clustering coefficient (CC), nodal efficiency (NE), betweenness centrality (BC), and eigenvector centrality (EVC). NBS identified a subnetwork primarily composed of right intra-hemispheric connections. Significantly different (p < .05) nodes were primarily in the right hemisphere for the CC and NE and primarily in the left hemisphere for the BC and EVC. These results indicate that intra-hemispheric MEG networks may be incorporated in the diagnosis and lateralization of focal epilepsy.

However, validation of these novel technologies against PSG is required. The current study aims to evaluate the sleep staging performance of the radar-based Circadia Contactless Breathing Monitor (model C100) and proprietary Sleep Analysis Algorithm, both in a home and sleep lab environment, on cohorts of healthy sleepers. The C100 device was initially used to record 17 nights of sleep data from 9 participants alongside PSG, with a subsequent 24 nights of PSG data for validation purposes. Respiration and body movement features were extracted from sensor data, and a machine learning algorithm was developed to perform sleep stage prediction. The algorithm was trained using PSG data obtained in the initial dataset (n=17), and validated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. An epoch-by-epoch recall (true positive rate) of 75.0 %, 59.9 %, 74.8% and 57.1 %, was found for 'Deep', 'Light', 'REM' and 'Wake' respectively. Highly similar results were obtained in the independent validation dataset (n=24), indicating robustness of results and generalizability of the sleep staging model, at least in the healthy population. The device was found to outperform both a consumer and medical grade wrist-worn monitoring device (Fitbit Alta HR and Philips Respironics Actiwatch) on sleep metric estimation accuracy. These results indicate that the developed non-contact monitor forms a viable alternative to existing clinically used wrist-worn methods, and that longitudinal monitoring of sleep stages in a home environment becomes feasible.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between dementia and normal brain aging. About 50% of MCI subjects are already in a stage that is prodromal-to-dementia and during the following 3 to 5 years will develop clinically evident symptoms, while the other 50% remains at MCI or returns to normal. If the risk factors favoring degenerative mechanisms are modified during early stages (i.e., in the prodromal), the degenerative process and the loss of abilities in daily living activities will be delayed. It is therefore extremely important to have biomarkers able to identify-in association with neuropsychological tests-prodromal-to-dementia MCI subjects as early as possible. MCI is a large (i.e., several million in EU) and substantially healthy population; therefore, biomarkers should be financially affordable, largely available and non-invasive, but still accurate in their diagnostic prediction. Neurodegeneration initially affects synaptic transmission and brain connectivity; methods exploring them would represent a 1st line screening. Neurophysiological techniques able to evaluate mechanisms of synaptic function and brain connectivity are attracting general interest and are described here. Results are quite encouraging and suggest that by the application of artificial intelligence (i.e., learning-machine), neurophysiological techniques represent valid biomarkers for screening campaigns of the MCI population.

Additionally, we seek to determine the relationship between F-18-FDG-PET data and post-surgical seizure outcome. Methods Thirty-eight patients with MCD were explored with F-18-FDG PET and SEEG. We compared PET metabolism of each patient to a control population of healthy subjects. Based on MRI and SEEG, we separated 4 distinct zones at individual level: lesional, epileptogenic non-lesional, propagation, and non-involved. Then, we analysed (1) difference of PET metabolism within these four distinct zones; (2) performance of PET in defining the EZ within the SEEG-sampled areas; and (3) relation between extension of PET hypometabolism and post-surgical seizure outcome. Results We found (1) a gradient of PET hypometabolism from non-involved to propagation, then to epileptogenic and lesional zones (p < 0.001); (2) good performance of PET in defining the EZ (AUC of ROC curve = 0.82); (3) poorer post-surgical prognosis associated with PET hypometabolism extension beyond SEEG sampling (p = 0.024). Conclusion F-18-FDG-PET has good accuracy in determining EZ in patients with MCD even if the hypometabolism is not limited to the EZ. Furthermore, hypometabolic extension is unfavourably associated with post-surgical prognosis.

Sensory Integration in Human Movement: A New Brain-Machine Interface Based on Gamma Band and Attention Level for Controlling a Lower-Limb Exoskeleton	FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						brain-machine interface; EEG; gamma band; lower-limb exoskeleton; motor imagery; human movement; sensory integration; Stockwell Transform	MOTOR IMAGERY; GAIT	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can improve the control of assistance mobility devices making its use more intuitive and natural. In the case of an exoskeleton, they can also help rehabilitation therapies due to the reinforcement of neuro-plasticity through repetitive motor actions and cognitive engagement of the subject. Therefore, the cognitive implication of the user is a key aspect in BMI applications, and it is important to assure that the mental task correlates with the actual motor action. However, the process of walking is usually an autonomous mental task that requires a minimal conscious effort. Consequently, a brain-machine interface focused on the attention to gait could facilitate sensory integration in individuals with neurological impairment through the analysis of voluntary gait will and its repetitive use. This way the combined use of BMI+exoskeleton turns from assistance to restoration. This paper presents a new brain-machine interface based on the decoding of gamma band activity and attention level during motor imagery mental tasks. This work also shows a case study tested in able-bodied subjects prior to a future clinical study, demonstrating that a BMI based on gamma band and attention-level paradigm allows real-time closed-loop control of a Rex exoskeleton.

Matrix of Lags: A tool for analysis of multiple dependent time series applied for CAP scoring	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Time series analysis; Matrix of Lags; CAP; Sleep quality; ECG	CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; AUTOMATIC METHOD; SLEEP; SYNCHRONIZATION; SEQUENCES; PHASES	Background: Multiple methods have been developed to assess what happens between and within time series. In a particular type of these series, the previous values of the currently observed series are contingent on the lagged values of another series. These cases can commonly be addressed by regression. However, a model selection criteria should be employed to evaluate the compromise between the amount of information provided and the model complexity. This is the basis for the development of the Matrix of Lags (MoL), a tool to study dependent time series. Methods: For each input, multiple regressions were applied to produce a model for each lag and a model selection criterion identifies the lags that will populate an auxiliary matrix. Afterwards, the energy of the lags (that are in the auxiliary matrix) was used to define a row of the MoL. Therefore, each input corresponds to a row of the MoL. To test the proposed tool, the heart rate variability and the electrocardiogram derived respiration were employed to perform the indirect estimation of the electroencephalography cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) cycles. Therefore, a support vector machine was fed with the MoL to perform the CAP cycle classification for each input signal. Multiple tests were carried out to further examine the proposed tool, including the effect of balancing the datasets, application of other regression methods and employment of two feature section models. The first was based on sequential backward selection while the second examined characteristics of a return map. Results: The best performance of the subject independent model was attained by feeding the lags, selected by sequential backward selection, to a support vector machine, achieving an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of, respectively, 77%, 71%, 82% and 0.77. Conclusions: The developed model allows to perform a measurement of a characteristic marker of sleep instability (the CAP cycle) and the results are in the upper bound of the specialist agreement range with visual analysis. Thus, the developed method could possibly be used for clinical diagnosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is yet unclear to what extent JME leads to abnormal network activation patterns. Here, we characterized statistical regularities in magnetoencephalograph (MEG) resting-state networks and their differences between JME patients and controls by combining a pairwise maximum entropy model (pMEM) and novel energy landscape analyses for MEG. First, we fitted the pMEM to the MEG oscillatory power in the front-oparietal network (FPN) and other resting-state networks, which provided a good estimation of the occurrence probability of network states. Then, we used energy values derived from the pMEM to depict an energy landscape, with a higher energy state corresponding to a lower occurrence probability. JME patients showed fewer local energy minima than controls and had elevated energy values for the FPN within the theta, beta, and gamma bands. Furthermore, simulations of the fitted pMEM showed that the proportion of time the FPN was occupied within the basins of energy minima was shortened in JME patients. These network alterations were highlighted by significant classification of individual participants employing energy values as multivariate features. Our findings suggested that JME patients had altered multistability in selective functional networks and frequency bands in the fronto-parietal cortices. Author SummaryWe proposed an energy landscape method to quantify the occurrence probability of network states in magneto eucephalogram (MEG) oscillatory power during rest, which was derived from a pairwise maximum entropy model (pMEM). We compared the energy landscapes measures of three resting-state networks between patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and healthy controls. The pMEM provided a good fit to the binarized MEG oscillatory power in both patients and controls. Patients with JME exhibited fewer local minima of the energy and elevated energy values than controls, predominately in the fronto-parietal network across multiple frequency bands. Furthermore, multivariate features constructed from energy landscapes allowed significant single-patient classification. Our results further highlighted the pMEM as a descriptive, generative, and predictive model for characterizing atypical functional network properties in brain disorders.

Silent Speech Interfaces for Speech Restoration: A Review	IEEE ACCESS			English	Review						Muscles; Production; Brain injuries; Electromyography; Sensors; Speech recognition; Silent speech interface; speech restoration; automatic speech recognition; speech synthesis; deep neural networks; brain computer interfaces; speech and language disorders; voice disorders; electroencephalography; electromyography; electromagnetic articulography	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; DELAYED AUDITORY-FEEDBACK; TO-ACOUSTIC CONVERSION; DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; VOICE CONVERSION; VOCAL-TRACT; MYOELECTRIC SIGNALS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SPEAKER ADAPTATION; ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION	This review summarises the status of silent speech interface (SSI) research. SSIs rely on non-acoustic biosignals generated by the human body during speech production to enable communication whenever normal verbal communication is not possible or not desirable. In this review, we focus on the first case and present latest SSI research aimed at providing new alternative and augmentative communication methods for persons with severe speech disorders. SSIs can employ a variety of biosignals to enable silent communication, such as electrophysiological recordings of neural activity, electromyographic (EMG) recordings of vocal tract movements or the direct tracking of articulator movements using imaging techniques. Depending on the disorder, some sensing techniques may be better suited than others to capture speech-related information. For instance, EMG and imaging techniques are well suited for laryngectomised patients, whose vocal tract remains almost intact but are unable to speak after the removal of the vocal folds, but fail for severely paralysed individuals. From the biosignals, SSIs decode the intended message, using automatic speech recognition or speech synthesis algorithms. Despite considerable advances in recent years, most present-day SSIs have only been validated in laboratory settings for healthy users. Thus, as discussed in this paper, a number of challenges remain to be addressed in future research before SSIs can be promoted to real-world applications. If these issues can be addressed successfully, future SSIs will improve the lives of persons with severe speech impairments by restoring their communication capabilities.

The spatio-temporal complexity of spontaneous activity is strongly related to perceptual, learning, and cognitive brain functions; multi-fractal analysis can be utilized to evaluate the complexity of spontaneous activity. Recent studies have shown that the deterministic dynamic behavior of spontaneous activity especially reflects the topological neural network characteristics and changes of neural network structures. However, it remains unclear whether multi-fractal analysis, recently widely utilized for neural activity, is effective for detecting the complexity of the deterministic dynamic process. To verify this point, we focused on the log-normal distribution of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to evaluate the multi-fractality of spontaneous activity in a spiking neural network with a log-normal distribution of EPSPs. We found that the spiking activities exhibited multi-fractal characteristics. Moreover, to investigate the presence of a deterministic process in the spiking activity, we conducted a surrogate data analysis against the time-series of spiking activity. The results showed that the spontaneous spiking activity included the deterministic dynamic behavior. Overall, the combination of multi-fractal analysis and surrogate data analysis can detect deterministic complex neural activity. The multi-fractal analysis of neural activity used in this study could be widely utilized for brain modeling and evaluation methods for signals obtained by neuroimaging modalities.

Methods: FBM during glioma surgery (10/2016 to 5/2019) recorded ADs using a 22-channel circular grid compared to conventional strip electrodes. ADs were analyzed for detection, duration, amplitude, morphology, histology, direction, and clinical signs. Results: Thirty-two patients (mean age 54.2 years; r = 30-75) with glioma (WHO grade II-IV; 20 grade IV) had surgery. ADs during FBM were more likely in patients with wild-type as opposed to IDH-1 mutants (p < 0.0001) using more contacts compared with linear strip electrodes (p = 0.0001). More sensors tended to be involved in ADs detected by the circular grid vs strips (6.61 vs 3.43; p = 0.16) at lower stimulus intensity (3.14 mA vs 4.13 mA; p = 0.09). No difference in the number of cortical stimulations before resection was present (38.9 mA vs 47.9 mA; p = 0.26). ADs longer than 10 seconds were 32.5 seconds (circular grid) vs 58.4 (strips) (p = 0.12). Conclusions: High-density circular grids detect ADs in 360 degrees during FBM for glioma resection. Provocation of ADs was more likely in patients with wild-type than IDH-1 mutation. Significance: Circular grids offer high-resolution ECoG during intraoperative FBM for detection of ADs.

A Novel User Control for Lower Extremity Rehabilitation Exoskeletons	FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI			English	Article						lower extremity exoskeletons; gait; spinal cord injury; rehabilitation robotics; robot control systems	BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES; CEREBRAL-PALSY DESIGN; WALKING; GAIT; ASYMMETRY; CHILDREN	Lower extremity exoskeletons offer the potential to restore ambulation to individuals with paraplegia due to spinal cord injury. However, they often rely on preprogrammed gait, initiated by switches, sensors, and/or EEG triggers. Users can exercise only limited independent control over the trajectory of the feet, the speed of walking, and the placement of feet to avoid obstacles. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a novel approach that naturally decodes a neuromuscular surrogate for a user's neutrally planned foot control, uses the exoskeleton's motors to move the user's legs in real-time, and provides sensory feedback to the user allowing real-time sensation and path correction resulting in gait similar to biological ambulation. Users express their desired gait by applying Cartesian forces via their hands to rigid trekking poles that are connected to the exoskeleton feet through multi-axis force sensors. Using admittance control, the forces applied by the hands are converted into desired foot positions, every 10 milliseconds (ms), to which the exoskeleton is moved by its motors. As the trekking poles reflect the resulting foot movement, users receive sensory feedback of foot kinematics and ground contact that allows on-the-fly force corrections to maintain the desired foot behavior. We present preliminary results showing that our novel control can allow users to produce biologically similar exoskeleton gait.

J	Sun, KT; Hsieh, KL; Syu, SR				Sun, Koun-Tem; Hsieh, Kai-Lung; Syu, Syuan-Rong			Towards an Accessible Use of a Brain-Computer Interfaces-Based Home Care System through a Smartphone	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							MENTAL PROSTHESIS; P300; POTENTIALS	This study proposes a home care system (HCS) based on a brain-computer interface (BCI) with a smartphone. The HCS provides daily help to motor-disabled people when a caregiver is not present. The aim of the study is two-fold: (1) to develop a BCI-based home care system to help end-users control their household appliances, and (2) to assess whether the architecture of the HCS is easy for motor-disabled people to use. A motion-strip is used to evoke event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain of the user, and the system immediately processes these potentials to decode the user's intentions. The system, then, translates these intentions into application commands and sends them via Bluetooth to the user's smartphone to make an emergency call or to execute the corresponding app to emit an infrared (IR) signal to control a household appliance. Fifteen healthy and seven motor-disabled subjects (including the one with ALS) participated in the experiment. The average online accuracy was 81.8% and 78.1%, respectively. Using component N2P3 to discriminate targets from nontargets can increase the efficiency of the system. Results showed that the system allows end-users to use smartphone apps as long as they are using their brain waves. More important, only one electrode O1 is required to measure EEG signals, giving the system good practical usability. The HCS can, thus, improve the autonomy and self-reliance of its end-users.

It has been demonstrated to perform well in spelling words. However, different from spelling English words in one-dimension sequences, Chinese characters are often written in a two-dimensional structure. Previous studies had never investigated how to use BCI to 'write' but not 'spell' Chinese characters. This study developed an innovative BCI-controlled robot for writing Chinese characters. The BCI system contained 108 commands displayed in a 9*12 array. A pixel-based writing method was proposed to map the starting point and ending point of each stroke of Chinese characters to the array. Connecting the starting and ending points for each stroke can make up any Chinese character. The large command set was encoded by the hybrid P300 and SSVEP features efficiently, in which each output needed only 1s of EEG data. The task-related component analysis was used to decode the combined features. Five subjects participated in this study and achieved an average accuracy of 87.23% and a maximal accuracy of 100%. The corresponding information transfer rate was 56.85 bits/min and 71.10 bits/min, respectively. The BCI-controlled robotic arm could write a Chinese character '(sic)' with 16 strokes within 5.7 seconds for the best subject. The demo video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1w-e2dBGl0. The study results demonstrated that the proposed BCI-controlled robot is efficient for writing ideogram (e.g. Chinese characters) and phonogram (e.g. English letter), leading to broad prospects for real-world applications of BCIs.

A functional spiking-neuron model of activity-silent working memory in humans based on calcium-mediated short-term synaptic plasticity	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RECURRENT NETWORK; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; STATES; FOCUS	In this paper, we present a functional spiking-neuron model of human working memory (WM). This model combines neural firing for encoding of information with activity-silent maintenance. While it used to be widely assumed that information in WM is maintained through persistent recurrent activity, recent studies have shown that information can be maintained without persistent firing; instead, information can be stored in activity-silent states. A candidate mechanism underlying this type of storage is short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP), by which the strength of connections between neurons rapidly changes to encode new information. To demonstrate that STSP can lead to functional behavior, we integrated STSP by means of calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in a large-scale spiking-neuron model and added a decision mechanism. The model was used to simulate a recent study that measured behavior and EEG activity of participants in three delayed-response tasks. In these tasks, one or two visual gratings had to be maintained in WM, and compared to subsequent probes. The original study demonstrated that WM contents and its priority status could be decoded from neural activity elicited by a task-irrelevant stimulus displayed during the activity-silent maintenance period. In support of our model, we show that it can perform these tasks, and that both its behavior as well as its neural representations are in agreement with the human data. We conclude that information in WM can be effectively maintained in activity-silent states by means of calcium-mediated STSP	[Pals, Matthijs; Borst, Jelmer P.] Univ Groningen, Bernoulli Inst, Groningen, Netherlands; [Stewart, Terrence C.] Univ Waterloo, Ctr Theoret Neurosci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Akyurek, Elkan G.] Univ Groningen, Dept Expt Psychol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Borst, Jelmer P.] Univ Groningen, Groningen Cognit Syst & Mat Ctr, Groningen, Netherlands		Borst, JP (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Bernoulli Inst, Groningen, Netherlands.; Borst, JP (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Groningen Cognit Syst & Mat Ctr, Groningen, Netherlands.	j.p.borst@rug.nl	Borst, Jelmer/C-4666-2008	Borst, Jelmer/0000-0002-4493-8223; Pals, Matthijs/0000-0002-0640-2145; Akyurek, Elkan/0000-0001-9111-5847	Open Research Area grant [NWO 464.18.114]	Open Research Area grant	This research was in part funded by an Open Research Area grant to EGA (NWO 464.18.114).		52	4	4	1	6	PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE	SAN FRANCISCO	1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA	1553-734X	1553-7358		PLOS COMPUT BIOL	PLoS Comput.

Decoding of Subjective Pain-Sensitivity by Brain Signal Analysis Using a General Type-2 Fuzzy Classifier	2020 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	DEC 01-04, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc		pain perception; power spectral density; eLORETA; General Type-2 fuzzy classifier	PERCEPTION; STATE; EXTRACTION; SYSTEM	The prime mechanism governing the variability of pain perception across different subjects is still unexplored. This paper intends to develop a novel methodology to investigate this phenomenon using EEC signal analysis system. First, the EEG signals are procured from the scalp of subjects who are presented with three types of touch stimuli: heat, bristles and pinch with varying intensity levels. The raw brain signals acquired are analyzed using eLORETA software that confirms the involvement of primary somatosensory cortex and dorsal region of anterior cingulate cortex for this cognitive activity. Additionally, frequency analysis undertaken infers the participation of delta, alpha and theta bands for the said task. The signals arc then transferred to a feature extraction module where a dual feature extraction strategy has been employed using Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the diversity of the feature set. The abstracted features are further evaluated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain the most important or optimal features. The reduced feature set is transferred to a novel General Type-2 fuzzy classifier that is able to precisely classify the distinct class labels and also outperforms its conventional counterparts. Hence, this method can help to assess the variability of pain perception amongst individuals whose communication modality is crippled due to scenarios pertaining to neurological disorders, anaesthetic treatments and the like. Moreover, the present scheme can he utilized as a neuronal marker to distinguish individuals suffering from extreme sensitivity towards pain from the healthy ones.

Visually evoked responses are enhanced when engaging in a video game	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						decoding; EEG; naturalistic stimuli; visual perception	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; BRAIN; INTERFACE; PREMOTOR; SYSTEMS; MEMORY	While it is well known that vision guides movement, less appreciated is that the motor cortex also provides input to the visual system. Here, we asked whether neural processing of visual stimuli is acutely modulated during motor activity, hypothesizing that visual evoked responses are enhanced when engaged in a motor task that depends on the visual stimulus. To test this, we told participants that their brain activity was controlling a video game that was in fact the playback of a prerecorded game. The deception, which was effective in half of participants, aimed to engage the motor system while avoiding evoked responses related to actual movement or somatosensation. In other trials, subjects actively played the game with keyboard control or passively watched a playback. The strength of visually evoked responses was measured as the temporal correlation between the continuous stimulus and the evoked potentials on the scalp. We found reduced correlation during passive viewing, but no difference between active and sham play. Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity was reduced over central electrodes during sham play, indicating recruitment of motor cortex despite the absence of overt movement. To account for the potential increase of attention during gameplay, we conducted a second study with subjects counting screen items during viewing. We again found increased correlation during sham play, but no difference between counting and passive viewing. While we cannot fully rule out the involvement of attention, our findings do demonstrate an enhancement of visual evoked responses during active vision.

Listening to the radio (RADIO) has been proven to be a relatively effective "in-car" countermeasure. However, the connectivity analysis, which can be used to investigate its alerting effect, is subject to the issue of signal mixing. In this study, we propose a novel framework based on clustering and entropy to improve the performance of the connectivity analysis to reveal the effect of RADIO to maintain driver alertness. Regardless of reducing signal mixing, we introduce clustering algorithm to classify the functional connections with their nodes into different categories to mine the effective information of the alerting effect. Differential entropy (DE) is employed to measure the information content in different brain regions after clustering. Compared with the Louvain-based community detection method, the proposed method shows more superior ability to present RADIO effectin confused functional connection matrices. Our experimental results reveal that the active connection clusters distinguished by the proposed method gradually move from frontal region to parieto-occipital regionwith the progress of fatigue, consistent with the alpha energy changes in these two brain areas. The active class of the clusters in parieto-occipital region significantly decreases and the most active clusters remain in the frontal region when RADIO is taken. The estimation results of DE confirm the significant change (p< 0.05) of information content due to the cluster movements. Hence, preventing the movement of the active clusters from frontal region to parieto-occipital region may correlate with maintaining driver alertness. The revelation of alerting effect is helpful for the targeted upgrade of fatigue countermeasures.

After injury, the signals below the lesion are disrupted, but the brain still produces motor commands. Researchers have bypassed this obstacle, which has given rise to the brain-machine interface (BMI). BMI devices are implanted in the brain or spinal cord, where they decode and send signals beyond the injured segment. Experiments were initially conducted on animals, with favorable results. BMIs are classified according to their type, function, signal generation, and so on. Because of invasiveness, their long-term use is questionable, because of infections and complications. The use of an implantable epidural array in patients with chronic SCI showed that participants were able to walk with the help of a stimulator, and after months of training, they were able to walk with the stimulator turned off. Another innovation is a robotic suit for paraplegics and tetraplegics that supports the movement of limbs. The research on stem cells has not shown favorable results. In future, one of these cutting-edge technologies will prevail over the other, but BMI seems to have the upper hand. The future of BMI with fusion of robotics and artificial intelligence is promising for patients with chronic SCI. These modern devices need to be less invasive, biocompatible, easily programmable, portable, and cost-effective. After these hurdles are overcome, the devices may become the mainstay of potential rehabilitation therapy for partial recovery. The time may come when all patients with severe SCI are told "You will walk again."

Currently, electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used by the clinicians to diagnose MI patients due to its inexpensiveness and non-invasive nature. Pathological alterations provoked by MI cause slow conduction by increasing axial resistance on coupling between cells. This issue may cause abnormal patterns in the dynamics of the tip of the cardiac vector in the ECG signals. However, manual interpretation of the pathological alternations induced by MI is a time-consuming, tedious and subjective task. To overcome such disadvantages, computer-aided diagnosis techniques including signal processing and artificial intelligence tools have been developed. In this study we propose a novel technique for automatic detection of MI based on hybrid feature extraction and artificial intelligence tools. Tunable quality factor (Q-factor) wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and phase space reconstruction (PSR) are utilized to extract representative features to form cardiac vectors with synthesis of the standard 12-lead and Frank XYZ leads. They are combined with neural networks to model, identify and detect abnormal patterns in the dynamics of cardiac system caused by MI. First, 12-lead ECG signals are reduced to 3-dimensional VCG signals, which are synthesized with Frank XYZ leads to build a hybrid 4-dimensional cardiac vector. Second, this vector is decomposed into a set of frequency subbands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method. Third, VMD is employed to decompose the subband of the 4-dimensional cardiac vector into different intrinsic modes, in which the first intrinsic mode contains the majority of the cardiac vector's energy and is considered to be the predominant intrinsic mode. It is selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Fourth, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear cardiac system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in cardiac system dynamics between normal (healthy) and MI cardiac vector signals. Fifth, cardiac system dynamics can be modeled and identified using neural networks, which employ the ED of 3D PSR of the reference variable as the input features. The difference of cardiac system dynamics between healthy control and MI cardiac vector is computed and used for the detection of MI based on a bank of estimators. Finally, data sets, which include conventional 12-lead and Frank XYZ leads ECG signal fragments from 148 patients with MI and 52 healthy controls from PTB diagnostic ECG database, are used for evaluation. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy is reported to be 97.98%. Currently, ST segment evaluation is one of the major and traditional ways for the MI detection. However, there exist weak or even undetectable ST segments in many ECG signals. Since the proposed method does not rely on the information of ST waves, it can serve as a complementary MI detection algorithm in the intensive care unit (ICU) of hospitals to assist the clinicians in confirming their diagnosis. Overall, our results verify that the pro- posed features may satisfactorily reflect cardiac system dynamics, and are complementary to the existing ECG features for automatic cardiac function analysis.

A systematic approach was used to undertake a literature review. Five electronic databases (PubMed; Scopus; Google Scholar; Cochrane Epilepsy Group specialised register; Cochrane Register of Controlled Trails (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Online Trials) were searched using predetermined relevant search terms. In total, 668 articles were identified. Duplicates were removed and predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and a PRISMA flow chart was produced. Data was extracted using Covidence software. Twelve studies on Epilepsy and CD involving a total of 70 participants were selected for analysis; narrative synthesis was used owing to the small sample sizes in the selected studies. None of the 12 studies meeting inclusion criteria investigated gluten sensitivity and epilepsy. All the included studies support a link between epilepsy and CD. GFD was effective in 44 out of 70 participants across the studies in terms of a reduction of seizures, reduction of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or normalisation of EEG pattern. A total of 44 participants showed a reduction in seizures (across eight studies) and complete cessation of seizures was reported in 22 participants. In general, the earlier the GFD is implemented after the onset of seizures, the better the likelihood of the GFD being successful in supporting control of seizures. Mechanisms linking gluten with epilepsy are not fully understood; possible hypotheses include gluten mediated toxicity, immune-induced cortical damage and malabsorption. Evidence suggests the effectiveness of a GFD in supporting the management of epilepsy in patients with CD, although the quality of evidence is low. There appears to be a growing number of neurologists who are prepared to advocate the use of a GFD. A multidisciplinary approaches and further research are recommended. It could be argued that when balancing potential treatments such as AEDs or surgery, a GFD has a low likelihood of harm.

Cognitive and affective probing: a tutorial and review of active learning for neuroadaptive technology	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						cognitive probing; neuroadaptive technology; passive brain-computer interfacing; human-computer interaction; active learning	SINGLE TRIAL EEG; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; INTERFACES	Objective. The interpretation of neurophysiological measurements has a decades-long history, culminating in current real-time brain-computer interfacing (BCI) applications for both patient and healthy populations. Over the course of this history, one focus has been on the investigation of cortical responses to specific stimuli. Such responses can be informative with respect to the human user's mental state at the time of presentation. An ability to decode neurophysiological responses to stimuli in real time becomes particularly powerful when combined with a simultaneous ability to autonomously produce such stimuli. This allows a computer to gather stimulus-response samples and iteratively produce new stimuli based on the information gathered from previous samples, thus acquiring more, and more specific, information. This information can even be obtained without the explicit, voluntary involvement of the user. Approach. We define cognitive and affective probing, referring to an application of active learning where repeated sampling is done by eliciting implicit brain responses. In this tutorial, we provide a definition of this method that unifies different past and current implementations based on common aspects. We then discuss a number of aspects that differentiate various possible implementations of cognitive probing. Main results. We argue that a key element is the user model, which serves as both information storage and basis for subsequent probes. Cognitive probing can be used to continuously and autonomously update this model, refining the probes, and obtaining increasingly detailed or accurate information from the resulting brain activity. In contrast to a number of potential advantages of the method, cognitive probing may also pose a threat to informed consent, our privacy of thought, and our ability to assign responsibility to actions mediated by the system. Significance. This tutorial provides guidelines to both implement, and critically discuss potential ethical implications of, novel cognitive probing applications and research endeavours.

J	von Luhmann, A; Ortega-Martinez, A; Boas, DA; Yucel, MA				von Luehmann, Alexander; Ortega-Martinez, Antonio; Boas, David A.; Yucel, Meryem Ayse			Using the General Linear Model to Improve Performance in fNIRS Single Trial Analysis and Classification: A Perspective	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						fNIRS; BCI; GLM; preprocessing; classification; HRF; short-separation; nuisance regression	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; NIRS HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; BRAIN ACTIVATION; MOTOR STIMULI; EEG; ARTIFACTS; REDUCE	Within a decade, single trial analysis of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals has gained significant momentum, and fNIRS joined the set of modalities frequently used for active and passive Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). A great variety of methods for feature extraction and classification have been explored using state-of-the-art Machine Learning methods. In contrast, signal preprocessing and cleaning pipelines for fNIRS often follow simple recipes and so far rarely incorporate the available state-of-the-art in adjacent fields. In neuroscience, where fMRI and fNIRS are established neuroimaging tools, evoked hemodynamic brain activity is typically estimated across multiple trials using a General Linear Model (GLM). With the help of the GLM, subject, channel, and task specific evoked hemodynamic responses are estimated, and the evoked brain activity is more robustly separated from systemic physiological interference using independent measures of nuisance regressors, such as short-separation fNIRS measurements. When correctly applied in single trial analysis, e.g., in BCI, this approach can significantly enhance contrast to noise ratio of the brain signal, improve feature separability and ultimately lead to better classification accuracy. In this manuscript, we provide a brief introduction into the GLM and show how to incorporate it into a typical BCI preprocessing pipeline and cross-validation. Using a resting state fNIRS data set augmented with synthetic hemodynamic responses that provide ground truth brain activity, we compare the quality of commonly used fNIRS features for BCI that are extracted from (1) conventionally preprocessed signals, and (2) signals preprocessed with the GLM and physiological nuisance regressors. We show that the GLM-based approach can provide better single trial estimates of brain activity as well as a new feature type, i.e., the weight of the individual and channel-specific hemodynamic response function (HRF) regressor. The improved estimates yield features with higher separability, that significantly enhance accuracy in a binary classification task when compared to conventional preprocessing-on average +7.4% across subjects and feature types. We propose to adapt this well-established approach from neuroscience to the domain of single-trial analysis and preprocessing wherever the classification of evoked brain activity is of concern, for instance in BCI.

J	Lee, G; Choi, B; Jebelli, H; Ahn, CR; Lee, S				Lee, Gaang; Choi, Byungjoo; Jebelli, Houtan; Ahn, Changbum Ryan; Lee, SangHyun			Noise Reference Signal-Based Denoising Method for EDA Collected by Multimodal Biosensor Wearable in the Field	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Assessment of built environment; Wearable biosensor; Human stress; Electrodermal activity; Denoising	BUILT ENVIRONMENT; ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; STRESS; EEG; RECOGNITION; RESPIRATION; RECORDINGS; PHYSIOLOGY; LIFE	Since people in contemporary society spend most of their time interacting with the built environment, there is a growing need to thoroughly understand the quality of human-built environment interaction to improve quality of life. Recent wearable electrodermal activity (EDA) sensing has shown the potential to meet this need by continuously, less invasively, and less laboriously monitoring individuals' stress levels as an important dimension of the quality of interaction with the built environment. However, analyzing EDA to detect stress is still challenging due to significant intrinsic and extrinsic noises in EDA collected by a wearable biosensor in the field. Although several denoising methods have been proposed based on differences in signal characteristics between noises and desired EDA signals evoked by sources of interest (e.g., stress), these methods do not address intrinsic respiration noise due to similarities in the signal characteristics of respiration noise and desired EDA signals. To address this issue, the authors propose a denoising method that references simultaneously collected photoplethysmography (PPG) as a respiration noise-correlated signal to attenuate respiration noise as well as extrinsic noises. The performance of the proposed method was compared with advanced benchmark denoising methods using 25 subjects' stress data collected in the field. As a result, stress metrics calculated from EDA denoised using the proposed method were statistically more valid and reliable than ones from EDA denoised by benchmark denoising methods. Accordingly, machine learning models trained by having the stress metrics as features showed statistically higher accuracy with EDA denoised by the proposed method than by benchmark denoising methods. These results show that the proposed method can improve stress measurement using EDA by attenuating both intrinsic respiration noise and extrinsic noise. The finding contributes to the body of knowledge by demonstrating that intrinsic noise with signal characteristics indistinguishable from desirable signals can be suppressed by referencing another noise-correlated signal effortlessly acquired using multimodal wearable biosensors. This new knowledge will facilitate the application of wearable EDA sensing devices to continuously, less invasively, and less laboriously measure people's stress in their daily interactions with the built environment. Using wearable-based stress measurement, urban managers can detect and address environmental stressors in the built environment in a more scalable manner, thereby more effectively improving the quality of interaction between humans and the built environment.

This research focuses on the primary motor cortex M1 region, which is involved in human motor function as an activity command center. Understanding this region can help us to determine the mechanism of movement control by the brain, with applicability to other activity mechanisms. A time delay neural network (TDNN) is a suitable model for studying brain signals. TDNN can analyze comprehensive information for a period of successive signals, which is similar to the transmission mechanism of the M1 region. Therefore, this study used a TDNN to build a three-stage encoding system corresponding to the signal type, type arrangement, and time sequence of the brainwave signal from the M1 region and the encoded results were defined as codes, symbols, and commands, respectively. This study aimed to understand the relationship between movement and the M1 region by decoding the signal when the rat undertakes an action. First, we recorded the M1 signal from three rat action types (walk, stand up, and shift head) and performed signal processing. This included using a nonlinear energy operator to find the response points of each action signal. The signals were separated into several sections according to the response time points and independent component analysis was then used to extract the features of the signal (the signal of interest). Finally, we found 16 representative sample signals through a dynamic dimension increasing algorithm to train a three-stage TDNN. We then input the remaining feature signals of interest into the three-stage TDNN for encoding and classification. The results showed an accuracy rate for the three actions of 51.4%, 80.0%, and 54.3%, which means that it is feasible to explain the brain signal of M1 from the free-moving animal using a three-stage TDNN encoding model.

Moreover, it has become a fascinating tool to provide illustrative insights into the functioning of brain networks. New anatomical and pathophysiological models of DBS action have accelerated our understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders and brain functioning. The description of the brain networks arose through the unique ability to illustrate long-range interactions between interconnected brain regions as derived from state-of-the-art neuroimaging (structural, diffusion, and functional MRI) and the opportunity to record local and large-scale brain activity at millisecond temporal resolution (microelectrode recordings, local field potential, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography). In the first part of this review, we describe how neuroimaging techniques have led to current understanding of DBS effects, by identifying and refining the DBS targets and illustrate the actual view on the relationships between electrode locations and clinical effects. One step further, we discuss how neuroimaging has shifted the view of localized DBS effects to a modulation of specific brain circuits, which has been possible from the combination of electrode location reconstructions with recently introduced network imaging methods. We highlight how these findings relate to clinical effects, thus postulating neuroimaging as a key factor to understand the mechanisms of DBS action on behavior and clinical effects. In the second part, we show how invasive electrophysiology techniques have been efficiently integrated into the DBS set-up to precisely localize the neuroanatomical targets of DBS based on distinct region-specific patterns of neural activity. Next, we show how multi-site electrophysiological recordings have granted a real-time window into the aberrant brain circuits within and beyond DBS targets to quantify and map the dynamic properties of rhythmic oscillations. We also discuss how DBS alters the transient synchrony states of oscillatory networks in temporal and spatial domains during resting, task-based and motion conditions, and how this modulation of brain states ultimately shapes the functional response. Finally, we show how a successful decoding and management of electrophysiological proxies (beta bursts, phase-amplitude coupling) of aberrant brain circuits was translated into adaptive DBS stimulation paradigms for a targeted and state-dependent invasive electrical neuromodulation.

Based on human and experimental data we propose that a sleep-related epileptic transformation of normal neurological networks underlies epileptogenesis. Major childhood epilepsies as medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), absence epilepsy (AE) and human perisylvian network (PN) epilepsies - made us good models to study. These conditions come from an epileptic transformation of the affected functional systems. This approach allows a system-based taxonomy instead of the outworn generalized-focal classification. MTLE links to the memory-system, where epileptic transformation results in a switch of normal sharp wave-ripples to epileptic spikes and pathological high frequency oscillations, compromising sleep-related memory consolidation. Absence epilepsy (AE) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) belong to the corticothalamic system. The burst-firing mode of NREM sleep normally producing sleep-spindles turns to an epileptic working mode ejecting bilateral synchronous spike-waves. There seems to be a progressive transition from AE to JME. Shared absences and similar bilateral synchronous discharges show the belonging of the two conditions, while the continuous age windows - AE affecting schoolchildren, JME the adolescents - and the increased excitability in JME compared to AE supports the notion of progression. In perisylvian network epilepsies - idiopathic focal childhood epilepsies and electrical status epilepticus in sleep including Landau-Kleffner syndrome - centrotemporal spikes turn epileptic, with the potential to cause cognitive impairment. Postinjury epilepsies modeled by the isolated cortex model highlight the shared way of epileptogenesis suggesting the derailment of NREM sleep-related homeostatic plasticity as a common step. NREM sleep provides templates for plasticity derailing to epileptic variants under proper conditions. This sleep-origin explains epileptiform discharges' link and similarity with NREM sleep slow oscillations, spindles and ripples. Normal synaptic plasticity erroneously overgrowing homeostatic processes may derail toward an epileptic working-mode manifesting the involved system's features. The impact of NREM sleep is unclear in epileptogenesis occurring in adolescence and adulthood, when plasticity is lower. The epileptic process interferes with homeostatic synaptic plasticity and may cause cognitive impairment. Its type and degree depends on the affected network's function. We hypothesize a vicious circle between sleep end epilepsy. The epileptic derailment of normal plasticity interferes with sleep cognitive functions. Sleep and epilepsy interconnect by the pathology of plasticity.

In a popular implementation, called P300 speller, a subject looks at a display where characters are flashing and selects one character by attending to it. The selection is recognized as the item with the strongest ERP. The speller performs well when cortical responses to target and non-target stimuli are sufficiently different. Although many strategies have been proposed for improving the BCI spelling, a relatively simple one received insufficient attention in the literature: reduction of the visual field to diminish the contribution from non-target stimuli. Previously, this idea was implemented in a single-stimulus switch that issued an urgent command like stopping a robot. To tackle this approach further, we ran a pilot experiment where ten subjects operated a traditional P300 speller or wore a binocular aperture that confined their sight to the central visual field. As intended, visual field restriction resulted in a replacement of non-target ERPs with EEG rhythms asynchronous to stimulus periodicity. Changes in target ERPs were found in half of the subjects and were individually variable. While classification accuracy was slightly better for the aperture condition (84.3 +/- 2.9%, mean +/- standard error) than the no-aperture condition (81.0 +/- 2.6%), this difference was not statistically significant for the entire sample of subjects (N = 10). For both the aperture and no-aperture conditions, classification accuracy improved over 4 days of training, more so for the aperture condition (from 72.0 +/- 6.3% to 87.0 +/- 3.9% and from 72.0 +/- 5.6% to 97.0 +/- 2.2% for the no-aperture and aperture conditions, respectively). Although in this study BCI performance was not substantially altered, we suggest that with further refinement this approach could speed up BCI operations and reduce user fatigue. Additionally, instead of wearing an aperture, non-targets could be removed algorithmically or with a hybrid interface that utilizes an eye tracker. We further discuss how a P300 speller could be improved by taking advantage of the different physiological properties of the central and peripheral vision. Finally, we suggest that the proposed experimental approach could be used in basic research on the mechanisms of visual processing.
