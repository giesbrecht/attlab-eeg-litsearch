Machine learning provides a promising technique to optimize EEG patterns toward better decoding accuracy. However, existing algorithms do not effectively explore the underlying data structure capturing the true EEG sample distribution and, hence, can only yield a suboptimal decoding accuracy. To uncover the intrinsic distribution structure of EEG data, we propose a clustering-based multitask feature learning algorithm for improved EEG pattern decoding. Specifically, we perform affinity propagation-based clustering to explore the subclasses (i.e., clusters) in each of the original classes and then assign each subclass a unique label based on a one-versus-all encoding strategy. With the encoded label matrix, we devise a novel multitask learning algorithm by exploiting the subclass relationship to jointly optimize the EEG pattern features from the uncovered subclasses. We then train a linear support vector machine with the optimized features for EEG pattern decoding. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on three EEG data sets to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. The improved experimental results demonstrate the outstanding superiority of our algorithm, suggesting its prominent performance for EEG pattern decoding in BCI applications.

Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, are increasingly being applied to EEG data for pattern analysis, group membership classification, and brain-computer interface purposes. This study aimed to systematically review recent advances in ML and DL supervised models for decoding and classifying EEG signals. Moreover, this article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques used for EEG signal preprocessing and feature extraction. To this end, several academic databases were searched to explore relevant studies from the year 2000 to the present. Our results showed that the application of ML and DL in both mental workload and motor imagery tasks has received substantial attention in recent years. A total of 75% of DL studies applied convolutional neural networks with various learning algorithms, and 36% of ML studies achieved competitive accuracy by using a support vector machine algorithm. Wavelet transform was found to be the most common feature extraction method used for all types of tasks. We further examined the specific feature extraction methods and end classifier recommendations discovered in this systematic review.

Decoding the torque of lower limb joints from EEG recordings of pre-gait movements using a machine learning scheme	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Machine learning; Brain-machine interface; Continuous trajectory reconstruction; Electroencephalography; Lower limb kinetics	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; STROKE REHABILITATION; INTERFACE; CLASSIFICATION; ARTIFACTS; SIGNALS; WALKING	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are useful tools for controlling assistive devices. One current approach in this field is continuous trajectory reconstruction (CTR), which decodes variables from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. In this study, the CTR approach was applied to estimate kinetic variables from lower limb joints during pre-gait movements. The methodology consisted of a multi-layer perceptron capable of detecting patterns that represent the relation between EEG and torque signals acquired during motion tasks. The study also searched for an optimal subset of EEG channels based on the resulting patterns. A group of volunteers was recruited to execute pre-gait movements with both lower limbs to test the methodology. Results show that decodings of extracted patterns were successful in terms of the selected performance metrics; that is, the coefficient of determination, correlation coefficient, and signal-to-noise ratio. These metrics suggest that decodings for the right lower limb are better than for the left one, and that the most frequent electrodes in the optimal subsets for each task and joint show a tendency to lateralize. The results obtained suggest that this machine learning scheme could be used for future studies of the CTR of kinetic variables. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bio-signal based motion control system using deep learning models: a deep learning approach for motion classification using EEG and EMG signal fusion	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article; Early Access						Bioelectrical signal; Machine learning; Signal processing; Motion classification; Signal fusion; Deep learning		Bioelectrical time signals are the signals that can be measured through the electrical potential difference across an organ over the time. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals and Electromyography (EMG) signals are among the best-known bioelectrical signals used for medical diagnosis and motion classification. In traditional machine learning methods, the task of extracting unique patterns and features from both bioelectrical signals is hard and requires a specific expert knowledge to study the non-linear, non-stationary and complex nature of these signals. With recent advancement in deep learning methods, features can be extracted from raw data without any handcrafted features. In this paper, a new deep learning approach that integrates EEG with EMG signals is proposed to investigate the efficiency of deep learning in hybrid systems with signal fusion and study the effect of hyper parameters tuning to enhance classification accuracy and boost the performance of hand and wrist motion control without manual feature engineering. Three deep learning models including Convolution Neural Networks CNN model, Long Short Term recurrent neural networks model LSTM, and a combined CNN-LSTM model, were proposed for hybrid system for signal classification. Experiments were tested on a dataset of multi-channel EEG signals merged with multi-channel sEMG signals, to decode hand and wrist motion. Experimental results signify that the proposed deep learning models achieve high classification accuracies that outperform other traditional machine learning state-of-the-art methods with up to 3.5% improvement ratio which indicates the promising application of the approach. Consequently, this work contributes to an automatic classification that facilitates and improves the real-time control of bio-robotics applications, mainly for limb movement classification.

This study proposes a deep-learning-based technique to automatically search for the minimum number of channels applicable to general BMI paradigms using a compact convolutional neural network for electroencephalography (EEG)-based BMIs. For verification, three types of BMI paradigms are assessed: 1) the typical P300 auditory oddball; 2) the new top-down steady-state visually evoked potential; and 3) the endogenous motor imagery. We observe that the optimized minimal EEG-channel sets are automatically selected in all three cases. Their decoding accuracies using the minimal channels are statistically equivalent to (or even higher than) those based on all channels. The brain areas of the selected channel set are neurophysiologically interpretable for all of these cognitive task paradigms. This study shows that the minimal EEG channel set can be automatically selected, irrespective of the types of BMI paradigms or EEG input features using a deep-learning approach, which also contributes to their portability.

The use of deep networks in neuroscience is mainly focused to neuroimaging or brain computer interface -BCI- applications. In electroencephalography (EEG) research, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) mainly relies on linear algorithms, which require a homogeneous dataset and assume that discriminant features appear at consistent latencies and electrodes across trials. However, neural responses may shift in time or space during an experiment, resulting in under-estimation of discriminant features. Here, we aimed at using CNNs to classify EEG responses to external stimuli, by taking advantage of time- and space- unlocked neural activity, and at examining how discriminant features change over the course of an experiment, on a trial by trial basis. New method: We present a novel pipeline, consisting of data augmentation, CNN training, and feature visualization techniques, fine-tuned for MVPA on EEG data. Results: Our pipeline provides high classification performance and generalizes to new datasets. Additionally, we show that the features identified by the CNN for classification are electrophysiologically interpretable and can be reconstructed at the single-trial level to study trial-by-trial evolution of class-specific discriminant activity. Comparison with existing techniques: The developed pipeline was compared to commonly used MVPA algorithms like logistic regression and support vector machines, as well as to shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Our approach yielded significantly higher classification performance than existing MVPA techniques (p = 0.006) and comparable results to other CNNs for EEG data. Conclusion: In summary, we present a novel deep learning pipeline for MVPA of EEG data, that can extract trialby-trial discriminative activity in a data-driven way.

The results show that in actual and imagined movements, the accuracy of the left- and right-hand movements at different speeds is higher than when the speeds are the same. The proposed Adaptive Composite Common Spatial Pattern (ACCSP) and Self Adaptive Common Spatial Pattern (SACSP) algorithms have good classification effects on 5 subjects, with an average classification accuracy rate of 83.58 percent, which is an increase of 6.96 percent compared with traditional algorithms. When the training sample size is 10, the classification accuracy of the ACCSP algorithm is higher than that of the traditional CSP algorithm. The improved CSP algorithm combined with transfer learning embodies a good classification effect in both ACCSP and SACSP. Especially, the performance of SACSP mode is better. Combining the improved CSP algorithm proposed with the CSP-based transfer learning algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of the BCI classifier.

This study reports on the performance of various ML algorithms in evaluating efficacy of neurofeedback applied for treatment of central neuropathic pain (CNP). In the first phase of this study, we applied different ML algorithms for classification of electroencephalography (EEG) patterns, associated with CNP, obtained from three groups of participants, during imagined movement of their limbs, named as able-bodied (AB), paraplegic patients with (PWP) and without (PNP) neuropathic pain. In the second phase, we tested the accuracy of BCI-classifier by applying new EEG data obtained from PWP participants who have completed neurofeedback training provided for the management of pain. Support vector Machine (SVM) algorithm gained higher accuracy, with all groups, than the other classifiers. However, the highest classification accuracy of 99 +/- 0.49% was obtained with the right hand motor imagery of (AB vs PWP) group and 61 electrodes. In Conclusion, SVM based BCI-classifier achieved high accuracy in evaluating efficacy of neurofeedback applied for treatment of CNP. Results of this study show that the accuracy of BCI changes with ML algorithm, electrodes combinations, and training data set.

Currently, there is no universal method for explaining the predictions of a BCI decoder in terms of neurophysiologically relevant factors. In this paper, we propose an extension of a prominent, perturbation-based machine learning interpretability technique for EEG recordings. We validate this method with simulated EEG data and show that it can appropriately distinguish contributing electrodes and cortical sources across a range of BCI decoders. We also investigate the convergence properties of the method.

Aldo			Deep learning multimodal fNIRS and EEG signals for bimanual grip force decoding	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						fNIRS; EEG; brain-machine interface; deep learning; bimanual force decoding	BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACE; CORTICAL CONTROL; MOTOR; CORTEX; ACTIVATION; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS; REPRESENTATION; OSCILLATIONS; HANDEDNESS	Objective. Non-invasive brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) offer an alternative, safe and accessible way to interact with the environment. To enable meaningful and stable physical interactions, BMIs need to decode forces. Although previously addressed in the unimanual case, controlling forces from both hands would enable BMI-users to perform a greater range of interactions. We here investigate the decoding of hand-specific forces. Approach. We maximise cortical information by using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and developing a deep-learning architecture with attention and residual layers (cnnatt) to improve their fusion. Our task required participants to generate hand-specific force profiles on which we trained and tested our deep-learning and linear decoders. Main results. The use of EEG and fNIRS improved the decoding of bimanual force and the deep-learning models outperformed the linear model. In both cases, the greatest gain in performance was due to the detection of force generation. In particular, the detection of forces was hand-specific and better for the right dominant hand and cnnatt was better at fusing EEG and fNIRS. Consequently, the study of cnnatt revealed that forces from each hand were differently encoded at the cortical level. Cnnatt also revealed traces of the cortical activity being modulated by the level of force which was not previously found using linear models. Significance. Our results can be applied to avoid hand-cross talk during hand force decoding to improve the robustness of BMI robotic devices. In particular, we improve the fusion of EEG and fNIRS signals and offer hand-specific interpretability of the encoded forces which are valuable during motor rehabilitation assessment.

J	Zhang, MW; Hou, Y; Tang, RN; Li, YJ				Zhang, Mingwei; Hou, Yao; Tang, Rongnian; Li, Youjun			Embedding Tangent Space Extreme Learning Machine for EEG Decoding in Brain Computer Interface Systems	JOURNAL OF CONTROL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM	In motor imagery brain computer interface system, the spatial covariance matrices of EEG signals which carried important discriminative information have been well used to improve the decoding performance of motor imagery. However, the covariance matrices often suffer from the problem of high dimensionality, which leads to a high computational cost and overfitting. These problems directly limit the application ability and work efficiency of the BCI system. To improve these problems and enhance the performance of the BCI system, in this study, we propose a novel semisupervised locality-preserving graph embedding model to learn a low-dimensional embedding. This approach enables a low-dimensional embedding to capture more discriminant information for classification by efficiently incorporating information from testing and training data into a Riemannian graph. Furthermore, we obtain an efficient classification algorithm using an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier developed on the tangent space of a learned embedding. Experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves higher classification performance than benchmark methods on various datasets, including the BCI Competition IIa dataset and in-house BCI datasets.

Based on the combination of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the newly proposed features Local Binary Pattern Transition Histogram (LBPTH) and Local Binary Pattern Mean Absolute Deviation (LBPMAD), our proposed feature extraction method can efficiently extract features from EEG signals for machine learning classification of epilepsy, achieving high classification accuracy with a feature size of only 18 for each signal. Tested on the publicly available University of Bonn Epilepsy EEG Dataset using a signal length of 4097 data points (23.61 seconds), the proposed method achieved larger than 99.6% accuracy results for Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification of ictal (set E) against any non-ictal (set A, B, C, or D) or combinations of non-ictal (set A+B, set C+D, or set A+B+C+D) EEG signals, which is among the best of currently published works. Our method can maintain high classification accuracy even with short input signals, achieving more than 99.1% SVM classification accuracy when input signal length is reduced to 512 data points (2.95 seconds). The high accuracy, small feature size, ability to work with short input signals and low computing requirements made the proposed method suitable for mobile, low power, and low-cost wearable medical devices.

This is so mainly due to their very high training speed and generalization capabilities. Another important advantage is that they have only one hyperparameter that must be calibrated: the number of hidden nodes. While most traditional approaches dictate that this parameter should be chosen smaller than the number of available training examples, in this article we argue that, in the case of problems in which the data contain unrepresentative features, such as in EEG classification problems, it is beneficial to choose a much larger number of hidden nodes. We characterize this phenomenon, explain why this happens and exhibit several concrete examples to illustrate how ELMs behave. Furthermore, as searching for the optimal number of hidden nodes could be time consuming in enlarged ELMs, we propose a new training scheme, including a novel pruning method. This scheme provides an efficient way of finding the optimal number of nodes, making ELMs more suitable for dealing with real time EEG classification problems. Experimental results using synthetic data and real EEG data show a major improvement in the training time with respect to most traditional and state of the art ELM approaches, without jeopardising classification performance and resulting in more compact networks.

EEGs are useful in Brain controlled interfaces and other intelligent Neuroscience applications, but manual analysis of these brainwaves is complicated and time-consuming even for the experts of neuroscience. Various EEG analysis and classification techniques have been proposed to address this problem however, the conventional classification methods require identification and learning of specific EEG characteristics beforehand. Deep learning models can learn features from data without having in depth knowledge of data and prior feature identification. One of the great implementations of deep learning is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which has outperformed traditional neural networks in pattern recognition and image classification. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an efficient signal analysis technique that presents the magnitude of EEG signals as time-related Frequency components. Existing deep learning architectures suffer from poor performance when classifying EEG signals in the Time-frequency domain. To improve classification accuracy, we propose an integrated CWT and CNN technique which classifies five types of EEG signals using. We compared the results of proposed integrated CWT and CNN method with existing deep learning models e.g., GoogleNet, VGG16, AlexNet. Furthermore, the accuracy and loss of the proposed integrated CWT and CNN method have been cross validated using Kfold cross validation. The average accuracy and loss of Kfold cross-validation for proposed integrated CWT and CNN method are, 76.12% and 56.02% respectively. This model produces results on a publicly available dataset: Epilepsy dataset by UCI (Machine Learning Repository).

Such AAD methods are believed to be an important ingredient towards so-called neuro-steered assistive hearing devices. For example, traditional AAD decoders allow detecting to which of multiple speakers a listener is attending to by reconstructing the amplitude envelope of the attended speech signal from the EEG signals. Recently, an alternative paradigm to this stimulus reconstruction approach was proposed, in which the directional focus of auditory attention is determined instead, solely based on the EEG, using common spatial pattern filters (CSP). Here, we propose Riemannian geometry-based classification (RGC) as an alternative for this CSP approach, in which the covariance matrix of a new EEG segment is directly classified while taking its Riemannian structure into account. While the proposed RGC method performs similarly to the CSP method for short decision lengths (i.e., the amount of EEG samples used to make a decision), we show that it significantly outperforms it for longer decision window lengths.

As a purely data-driven subspace learning algorithm, DSP essentially is a spatial-domain filter and does not make full use of the information in frequency domain. The paper presents multilinear discriminative spatial patterns (MDSP) to derive multiple interrelated lower dimensional discriminative subspaces of low frequency movement-related cortical potential (MRCP). Experimental results on two finger movement tasks' EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MDSP method.

For EEG signal feature extraction, Riemannian covariance matrices are computed, whereas other three features into the time and frequency domain are extracted from each EMG channel, such as autoregressive models, signal slope changes, and zero crossing. In this approach, the Bayesian fusion method is used to combine predictions from Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) classifiers. Our proposed HBCI obtained average accuracy of 96.26%, recall of 93.97, kappa of 0.78, and false positive rate of 3.31%, outperforming solution only based on EEG or EMG, suggesting its potential for neuro-rehabilitation applications.

There are different symptoms to recognize schizophrenia from healthy people. It can affect the thinking pattern of the brain. Delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech are the common symptoms of Schizophrenia. In this study, we have used electroencephalography (EEG) signals to analyze and diagnose Schizophrenia using machine learning algorithms and found that temporal features performed well as compared to statistical features. EEG signals are the best way to analyze this disorder as they are intimately linked with human thinking patterns and provide information about brain activities. The present work proposes a Machine Learning (ML) model based on Logistic Regression (LR) along with two feature extraction libraries Time Series Feature Extraction Library (TSFEL) and MNE Python toolkit to diagnose Schizophrenia from EEG signals. The results are analyzed based on 5 different sampling techniques. The dataset was cross-validated using leave one subject out cross-validation (LOSOCV) using Scikit learn and achieve greater accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, macro average recall, and macro f1 score on temporal features respectively.

In this work, a new binary electroencephalography (EEG) signal decoding algorithm is proposed using a modified common spatial pattern and capsule network. The proposed method is realized by extracting the spectral-temporal common spatial pattern features from the EEG signals while preserving the time resolution of the signal. The resulting features are fed into the capsule network for automatic feature extraction and classification. The capsule network is known to be superior to convolutional neural networks in requiring less training data, which makes it a promising candidate for EEG signals classification. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared to that of the other methods by conducting several experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed method provides recognition accuracy higher than that provided by other methods.

Efficient anomaly detection from medical signals and images with convolutional neural networks for Internet of medical things (IoMT) systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						AI; anomaly detection (AD); corneal images; deep learning; EEG signals; IoMT; machine learning; traditional CNNs	AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION; SEIZURE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION	Deep learning is one of the most promising machine learning techniques that revolutionalized the artificial intelligence field. The known traditional and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been utilized in medical pattern recognition applications that depend on deep learning concepts. This is attributed to the importance of anomaly detection (AD) in automatic diagnosis systems. In this paper, the AD is performed on medical electroencephalography (EEG) signal spectrograms and medical corneal images for Internet of medical things (IoMT) systems. Deep learning based on the CNN models is employed for this task with training and testing phases. Each input image passes through a series of convolution layers with different kernel filters. For the classification task, pooling and fully-connected layers are utilized. Computer simulation experiments reveal the success and superiority of the proposed models for automated medical diagnosis in IoMT systems.	[Khalil, Ali A.; Khalaf, Ashraf A.

J	Tuncer, T				Tuncer, Turker			A new stable nonlinear textural feature extraction method based EEG signal classification method using substitution Box of the Hamsi hash function: Hamsi pattern	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						Hamsi-Pat; S-Box based feature generation; INCA; EEG signal classification; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence	EPILEPTIC SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BINARY PATTERN	Background: The EEG signal classification is crucial for epileptic seizure prediction. Therefore, many machine learning model has been presented to classify EEG signals accurately. Material and Method: This work presents a novel automated EEG classification method by using a novel nonlinear feature extractor, and it is called as Hamsi-Pat. It uses the substitution box (S-Box) of the Hamsi hash function. As stated in the literature, S-Boxes have generally used for diffusion in symmetric encryption (especially block ciphers) methods and cryptologic hash functions. Since it is a nonlinear structure, this work aims to illustrate the merit of an S-Box for feature generation. Therefore, a new generation feature generator, which is Hamsi-Pat, is presented by using S-Box of the Hamsi hash function, and a novel EEG classification method is proposed by using Hamsi-Pat. The presented biomedical signal classification method has three elementary phases, and these phases are Hamsi-Pat based multileveled feature generation, iterative neighborhood component analysis (INCA) selector based feature dimension reduction, and classification using k nearest neighborhood (kNN) classifier. The presented Hamsi-Pat and INCA based methods were tested on Bonn electroencephalography (EEG) datasets. Result: This model yielded 99.20% classification accuracy on the used EEG dataset for five classes case and it yielded 100.0% accuracies for other cases. Conclusion: These results obviously denoted that the S-Boxes can be considered as a feature generator, and a novel S-Box based feature generation research area can be defined as textural feature generation and statistical feature generation.

J	Yang, L; Song, YH; Jia, XY; Ma, K; Xie, LH				Yang, Lie; Song, Yonghao; Jia, Xueyu; Ma, Ke; Xie, Longhan			Two-branch 3D convolutional neural network for motor imagery EEG decoding	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN); motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) decoding; temporal and spatial features; 3D data augmentation; brain-computer interface (BCI)	SINGLE TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; INTERFACE; MACHINE; FILTERS; BCI	Objective. The original motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) data contains not only temporal features but also a large number of spatial features related to the distribution of electrodes on the brain. However, in the process of MI-EEG decoding, most of the current convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods do not make the utmost of the spatial features related to electrode distribution. Approach. In this study, we adopt a concise 3D representation for the MI-EEG data to take full advantage of the spatial features and propose a two-branch 3D CNN (TB-3D CNN) for the 3D representation of MI-EEG data. First, the spatial and temporal features of the input 3D samples are extracted by the spatial and temporal feature learning branches, respectively, to avoid the mutual interference between the temporal and spatial features. Then, the central loss is introduced into the TB-3D CNN framework to further improve the MI-EEG decoding accuracy. And a 3D data augmentation method based on the cyclic translation of time dimension is proposed for the 3D representation method to alleviate the overfitting problem. Main results. Some experiments are conducted on the famous BCI competition IV 2a dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MI-EEG decoding method. The experimental results comparison with some state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that the average accuracy of our method is 4.42% higher than that of the best of the comparative methods. Significance. The proposed MI-EEG decoding method has great promise to improve the performance of motor imagery brain-computer interface system.

Thus, these driver states are essential to the safety of automobiles. The design of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or autonomous vehicles will depend on their ability to interact effectively with the driver. A deeper understanding of the driver state is, therefore, paramount. Electroencephalography (EEG) is proven to be one of the most effective methods for driver state monitoring and human error detection. This paper discusses EEG-based driver state detection systems and their corresponding analysis algorithms over the last three decades. First, the commonly used EEG system setup for driver state studies is introduced. Then, the EEG signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms for driver state detection are reviewed. Finally, EEG-based driver state monitoring research is reviewed in-depth, and its future development is discussed. It is concluded that the current EEG-based driver state monitoring algorithms are promising for safety applications. However, many improvements are still required in EEG artifact reduction, real-time processing, and between-subject classification accuracy.

A rejection of independent components (ICs) is usually performed in semiautomatic mode and requires experts' involvement. As also revealed by our study, experts' opinions about the nature of a component often disagree, highlighting the need to develop a robust and sustainable automatic system for EEG ICs classification. The current article presents a toolbox and crowdsourcing platform for Automatic Labeling of Independent Components in Electroencephalography (ALICE) available via link . The ALICE toolbox aims to build a sustainable algorithm to remove artifacts and find specific patterns in EEG signals using ICA decomposition based on accumulated experts' knowledge. The difference from previous toolboxes is that the ALICE project will accumulate different benchmarks based on crowdsourced visual labeling of ICs collected from publicly available and in-house EEG recordings. The choice of labeling is based on the estimation of IC time-series, IC amplitude topography, and spectral power distribution. The platform allows supervised machine learning (ML) model training and re-training on available data subsamples for better performance in specific tasks (i.e., movement artifact detection in healthy or autistic children). Also, current research implements the novel strategy for consentient labeling of ICs by several experts. The provided baseline model could detect noisy IC and components related to the functional brain oscillations such as alpha and mu rhythm. The ALICE project implies the creation and constant replenishment of the IC database, which will improve ML algorithms for automatic labeling and extraction of non-brain signals from EEG. The toolbox and current dataset are open-source and freely available to the researcher community.

Auditory attention detection (AAD) seeks to detect the attended speaker from one's brain signals that will enable many innovative human-machine systems. However, effective representation learning of electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a neural attention mechanism that dynamically assigns differentiated weights to the subbands and the channels of EEG signals to derive discriminative representations for AAD. In the nutshell, we would like to build a computational attention mechanism, i.e., neural attention, to model the auditory attention in human brain. We incorporate the proposed neural attention into an AAD system, and validate the neural attention mechanism through comprehensive experiments on two publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art reference baselines.

Causal decoding of individual cortical excitability states	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						TMS; EEG; Excitability; Brain state; Classification; Machine learning	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; MOTOR EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MUSCLE RESPONSES; EEG; VARIABILITY; PHASE; CLASSIFICATION; PLASTICITY; FLUCTUATIONS	Brain responsiveness to stimulation fluctuates with rapidly shifting cortical excitability state, as reflected by oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG). For example, the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex changes from trial to trial. To date, individual estimation of the cortical processes leading to this excitability fluctuation has not been possible. Here, we propose a data-driven method to derive individually optimized EEG classifiers in healthy humans using a supervised learning approach that relates pre-TMS EEG activity dynamics to MEP amplitude. Our approach enables considering multiple brain regions and frequency bands, without defining them a priori, whose compound phase-pattern information determines the excitability. The individualized classifier leads to an increased classification accuracy of cortical excitability states from 57% to 67% when compared to mu-oscillation phase extracted by standard fixed spatial fillers. Results show that, for the used TMS protocol, excitability fluctuates predominantly in the mu-oscillation range, and relevant cortical areas cluster around the stimulated motor cortex, but between subjects there is variability in relevant power spectra, phases, and cortical regions. This novel decoding method allows causal investigation of the cortical excitability state, which is critical also for individualizing therapeutic brain stimulation.

Each subject participated in two scenarios (baseline and fatigue scenarios). Subjective ratings of fatigue levels were also obtained from the subjects using the NASA-Task Load Index (TLX). The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used to extract features from the raw EEG data. The support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier in the design of the machine learning algorithm. A grid search cross validation was exploited to find optimal hyperparameter settings. The best classification result was 90%, obtained by using all 14 EEG channels and linear kernel of SVM. The experimental results proved that a machine learning algorithm was able to reliably classify driving fatigue states using EEG data. This study demonstrated that CSP and SVM were promising in detecting driving fatigue, and therefore, they could be strong foundations for future efforts to reduce traffic accidents and save thousands of human lives.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns from brain activity and deep learning techniques are valuable resources in achieving this identification. We propose automated techniques that can process raw EEG waveforms to identify children who may have an increased risk of schizophrenia compared to typically developing children. We also analyse abnormal features that remain during developmental follow-up over a period of similar to 4 years in children with a vulnerability to schizophrenia initially assessed when aged 9 to 12 years. EEG data from participants were captured during the recording of a passive auditory oddball paradigm. We undertake a holistic study to identify brain abnormalities, first by exploring traditional machine learning algorithms using classification methods applied to hand-engineered features (event-related potential components). Then, we compare the performance of these methods with end-to-end deep learning techniques applied to raw data. We demonstrate via average cross-validation performance measures that recurrent deep convolutional neural networks can outperform traditional machine learning methods for sequence modeling. We illustrate the intuitive salient information of the model with the location of the most relevant attributes of a post-stimulus window. This baseline identification system in the area of mental illness supports the evidence of developmental and disease effects in a pre-prodromal phase of psychosis. These results reinforce the benefits of deep learning to support psychiatric classification and neuroscientific research more broadly.

J	Zhang, XN; Meng, QH; Zeng, M; Hou, HR				Zhang, Xiao-Nei; Meng, Qing-Hao; Zeng, Ming; Hou, Hui-Rang			Decoding olfactory EEG signals for different odor stimuli identification using wavelet-spatial domain feature	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Olfactory Stimuli; Feature extraction; Wavelet-spatial domain feature; Odor classification	PERCEPTION	Background: Decoding olfactory-induced electroencephalography (olfactory EEG) signals has gained significant attention in recent years, owing to its potential applications in several fields, such as disease diagnosis, multimedia applications, and brain-computer interaction (BCI). Extracting discriminative features from olfactory EEG signals with low spatial resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio is vital but challenging for improving decoding accuracy. New methods: By combining discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with one-versus-rest common spatial pattern (OVR-CSP), we develop a novel feature, named wavelet-spatial domain feature (WSDF), to decode the olfactory EEG signals. First, DWT is employed on EEG signals for multilevel wavelet decomposition. Next, the DWT coefficients obtained at a specific level are subjected to OVR-CSP for spatial filtering. Correspondingly, the variance is extracted to generate a discriminative feature set, labeled as WSDF. Results: To verify the effectiveness of WSDF, a classification of olfactory EEG signals was conducted on two data sets, i.e., a public EEG dataset 'Odor Pleasantness Perception Dataset (OPPD)', and a self-collected dataset, by using support vector machine (SVM) trained based on different cross-validation methods. Experimental results showed that on OPPD dataset, the proposed method achieved a best average accuracy of 100% and 94.47% for the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, respectively. Moreover, on our own dataset, the proposed method gave a highest average accuracy of 99.50%. Comparison with existing methods: Compared with a wide range of EEG features and existing works on the same dataset, our WSDF yielded superior classification performance. Conclusions: The proposed WSDF is a promising candidate for decoding olfactory EEG signals.

When people's emotions change under external stimuli, various physiological signals of the human body will fluctuate. Electroencephalography (EEG) is closely related to brain activity, making it possible to judge the subject's emotional changes through EEG signals. Meanwhile, machine learning algorithms, which are good at digging out data features from a statistical perspective and making judgments, have developed by leaps and bounds. Therefore, using machine learning to extract feature vectors related to emotional states from EEG signals and constructing a classifier to separate emotions into discrete states to realize emotion recognition has a broad development prospect. This paper introduces the acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification of EEG signals in sequence following the progress of EEG-based machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition. And it may help beginners who will use EEG-based machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition to understand the development status of this field.

J	Tryon, J; Trejos, AL				Tryon, Jacob; Trejos, Ana Luisa			Evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks as a Method of EEG-EMG Fusion	FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS			English	Article						convolutional neural networks; EEG signals; EMG signals; human-machine interfaces; sensor fusion	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION	Wearable robotic exoskeletons have emerged as an exciting new treatment tool for disorders affecting mobility; however, the human-machine interface, used by the patient for device control, requires further improvement before robotic assistance and rehabilitation can be widely adopted. One method, made possible through advancements in machine learning technology, is the use of bioelectrical signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), to classify the user's actions and intentions. While classification using these signals has been demonstrated for many relevant control tasks, such as motion intention detection and gesture recognition, challenges in decoding the bioelectrical signals have caused researchers to seek methods for improving the accuracy of these models. One such method is the use of EEG-EMG fusion, creating a classification model that decodes information from both EEG and EMG signals simultaneously to increase the amount of available information. So far, EEG-EMG fusion has been implemented using traditional machine learning methods that rely on manual feature extraction; however, new machine learning methods have emerged that can automatically extract relevant information from a dataset, which may prove beneficial during EEG-EMG fusion. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were developed using combined EEG-EMG inputs to determine if they have potential as a method of EEG-EMG fusion that automatically extracts relevant information from both signals simultaneously. EEG and EMG signals were recorded during elbow flexion-extension and used to develop CNN models based on time-frequency (spectrogram) and time (filtered signal) domain image inputs. The results show a mean accuracy of 80.51 +/- 8.07% for a three-class output (33.33% chance level), with an F-score of 80.74%, using time-frequency domain-based models. This work demonstrates the viability of CNNs as a new method of EEG-EMG fusion and evaluates different signal representations to determine the best implementation of a combined EEG-EMG CNN. It leverages modern machine learning methods to advance EEG-EMG fusion, which will ultimately lead to improvements in the usability of wearable robotic exoskeletons.

Analysis of which can provide researchers with useful physiological information. In order to recognize and classify EEG signals, a pattern recognition method for optimizing the support vector machine (SVM) by using improved squirrel search algorithm (ISSA) is proposed. The EEG signal is preprocessed, with its time domain features being extracted and directed to the SVM as feature vectors for classification and identification. In this paper, the method of good point set is used to initialize the population position, chaos and reverse learning mechanism are introduced into the algorithm. The performance test of the improved squirrel algorithm (ISSA) is carried out by using the benchmark function. As can be seen from the statistical analysis of the results, the exploration ability and convergence speed of the algorithm are improved. This is then used to optimize SVM parameters. ISSA-SVM model is established and built for classification of EEG signals, compared with other common SVM parameter optimization models. For data sets, the average classification accuracy of this method is 85.9%. This result is an improvement of 2-5% over the comparison method.

Due to the many different types of classifiers available to use, the analysis methods are also equally numerous. In this review, we will be examining specifically machine learning methods that have been developed for EEG analysis with bioengineering applications. We reviewed literature from 1988 to 2018 to capture previous and current classification methods for EEG in multiple applications. From this information, we are able to determine the overall effectiveness of each machine learning method as well as the key characteristics. We have found that all the primary methods used in machine learning have been applied in some form in EEG classification. This ranges from Naive-Bayes to Decision Tree/Random Forest, to Support Vector Machine (SVM). Supervised learning methods are on average of higher accuracy than their unsupervised counterparts. This includes SVM and KNN. While each of the methods individually is limited in their accuracy in their respective applications, there is hope that the combination of methods when implemented properly has a higher overall classification accuracy. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Machine Learning applications used in EEG analysis. It also gives an overview of each of the methods and general applications that each is best suited to.

In this work, the recently introduced technique of Graph Slepian functions is exploited for the robust decoding of motor imagery (MI) brain activity. The particular technique builds over the concept of graph Fourier transform (GFT) and provides additional flexibility in the subsequent data analysis by incorporating domain knowledge. Based on contrastive learning, we introduce an algorithmic pipeline that attains a data driven and subject specific design of Graph Slepian functions. These functions, by incorporating both the topology of the sensor array and the empirical evidence about the differential functional covariation, act as spatial filters that enhance the information conveyed by the multichannel signal and specifically relates to the participant's intention. The proposed technique for crafting Graph Slepians is incorporated in a MI-decoding scheme, in which the informed projections are fed to a support vector machine (SVM) that casts a prediction regarding the type of intended movement. The employed MI-decoder is evaluated based on two publicly available datasets and its superiority against popular alternatives in the field is established. Computational efficiency is listed among its main advantages, since it involves only simple matrix operations, allowing to consider its use in real-time implementations.

The quantity of movement speed is the fundamental issue in BCI that requires additional research. This paper investigated the classification of the slow and fast speeds of eight different upper limb movements through electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and information about the values of speed and maximum angle of movements from the MPU6050 module. Datasets were obtained by recording the EEG signals from 10 subjects and the module information connected on their right hand during movements. This study used Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) and Wavelet-Common Spatial Pattern (W-CSP) methods to extract speed features of movements. In both methods, features selected by the Mutual Information (MI) were sent to the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and various machine learning classifiers. Due to the results of subject-independent speed classification, the FBCSP-CNN method obtained the highest accuracy of 90% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.8 for flexion/extension of the shoulder. Results from our proposed method demonstrate the ability to introduce a refined set of control commands into the BCI system by recognizing the features associated with the speed of movement parameters.

Moreover, the boundaries of schizophrenia are not precisely demarcated from other nosologic categories, such as bipolar disorder. The early detection of schizophrenia can lead to a more effective treatment, improving patients? quality of life. Over the last decades, hundreds of studies aimed at specifying the neurobiological mechanisms that underpin clinical manifestations of schizophrenia, using techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Changes in event-related potentials of the EEG have been associated with sensory and cognitive deficits and proposed as biomarkers of schizophrenia. Besides contributing to a more effective diagnosis, biomarkers can be crucial to schizophrenia onset prediction and prognosis. However, any proposed biomarker requires substantial clinical research to prove its validity and costeffectiveness. Fueled by developments in computational neuroscience, automatic classification of schizophrenia at different stages (prodromal, first episode, chronic) has been attempted, using brain imaging pattern recognition methods to capture differences in functional brain activity. Advanced learning techniques have been studied for this purpose, with promising results. This review provides an overview of recent machine learningbased methods for schizophrenia classification using EEG data, discussing their potentialities and limitations. This review is intended to serve as a starting point for future developments of effective EEG-based models that might predict the onset of schizophrenia, identify subjects at high-risk of psychosis conversion or differentiate schizophrenia from other disorders, promoting more effective early interventions.

Clinical use of Electroencephalography in the Assessment of Acute Thermal Pain: A Narrative Review Based on Articles From 2009 to 2019	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						electroencephalography; acute; pain; machine learning; biomarker	HEAT EVOKED-POTENTIALS; SUBJECTIVE PAIN; TONIC PAIN; EEG; PERCEPTION; MULTIPLE; STIMULATION; MODULATION; PREDICTION; MIGRAINE	Nowadays, no practical system has successfully been able to decode and predict pain in clinical settings. The inability of some patients to verbally express their pain creates the need for a tool that could objectively assess pain in these individuals. Neuroimaging techniques combined with machine learning are seen as possible candidates for the identification of pain biomarkers. This review aimed to address the potential use of electroencephalographic features as predictors of acute experimental pain. Twenty-six studies using only thermal stimulations were identified using a PubMed and Scopus search. Combinations of the following terms were used: "EEG," "Electroencephalography," "Acute," "Pain," "Tonic," "Noxious," "Thermal," "Stimulation," "Brain," "Activity," "Cold," "Subjective," and "Perception." Results revealed that contact-heat-evoked potentials have been widely recorded over central areas during noxious heat stimulations. Furthermore, a decrease in alpha power over central regions was revealed, as well as increased theta and gamma powers over frontal areas. Gamma and theta rhythms were associated with connectivity between sensory and affective regions involved in pain processing.

While its effects are different for each person, they mostly include abnormal behaviour, periods of loss of awareness and seizures. There are various traditional methods used to analyse EEG signals for epilepsy detection, which concludes to be time-consuming. Recently, several automated seizure detection frameworks using machine learning algorithms have been proposed to replace conventional methods. In this paper, more emphasis has been given to develop SPPCA and SUBXPCA dimensionality reduction algorithms to increase the classification accuracy of various machine learning models. Firstly, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to EEG signals for extracting the time-frequency domain features of epileptic seizures such as the energy of each sub-pattern, spike rhythmicity, Relative Spike Amplitude (RSA), Dominant Frequency (DF) and Spectral Entropy (SE). The features obtained after performing DWT on an EEG signal are extensive in number, to select the prominent features and to retain their properties, correlation feature sub-pattern-based PCA (SPPCA), and cross sub-pattern correlation-based PCA (SUBXPCA) are used as a dimensionality reduction techniques. To validate the proposed work, performance evaluation parameter such as the accuracy of the time-frequency domain features from different combinations of the dataset has been compared with the latest state-of-the-art works. Simulation results show that the best accuracy of 97% is achieved for SPPCA algorithm by CatBoost classifier. And the best accuracy of 98% for SUBXPCA is achieved by random forest classifier, which clearly outperformed the other related works both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

They organize and coordinate neural activity in brain networks. How spontaneous transient states are altered in abnormal brain conditions is unknown. Here, we conducted a transient state analysis on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) source space and developed a state transfer analysis to patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). They uncovered different neural coordination patterns, including spatial power patterns, temporal dynamics, spectral shifts, and connectivity construction varies at potentially very fast (millisecond) time scales, in groups with different consciousness levels: healthy subjects, patients in minimally conscious state (MCS), and patients with vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS). Machine learning based on transient state features reveal high classification accuracy between MCS and VS/UWS. This study developed methodology of transient states analysis on EEG source space and abnormal brain conditions. Findings correlate spontaneous transient states with human consciousness and suggest potential roles of transient states in brain disease assessment.

J	Yang, J; Ma, ZM; Shen, T				Yang, Jun; Ma, Zhengmin; Shen, Tao			Multi-Time and Multi-Band CSP Motor Imagery EEG Feature Classification Algorithm	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						electroencephalogram decoding; motor imagery; common space pattern; sliding window	COMPUTER; SYSTEM	The effective decoding of motor imagination EEG signals depends on significant temporal, spatial, and frequency features. For example, the motor imagination of the single limbs is embodied in the mu (8-13 Hz) rhythm and beta (13-30 Hz) rhythm in frequency features. However, the significant temporal features are not necessarily manifested in the whole motor imagination process. This paper proposes a Multi-Time and Frequency band Common Space Pattern (MTF-CSP)-based feature extraction and EEG decoding method. The MTF-CSP learns effective motor imagination features from a weak Electroencephalogram (EEG), extracts the most effective time and frequency features, and identifies the motor imagination patterns. Specifically, multiple sliding window signals are cropped from the original signals. The multi-frequency band Common Space Pattern (CSP) features extracted from each sliding window signal are fed into multiple Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with the same parameters. The Effective Duration (ED) algorithm and the Average Score (AS) algorithm are proposed to identify the recognition results of multiple time windows. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on the EEG data of nine subjects in the 2008 BCI-2a competition dataset, including a train dataset and a test dataset collected in other sessions. As a result, the average cross-session recognition accuracy of 78.7% was obtained on nine subjects, with a sliding window length of 1 s, a step length of 0.4 s, and the six windows. Experimental results showed the proposed MTF-CSP outperforming the compared machine learning and CSP-based methods using the original signals or other features such as time-frequency picture features in terms of accuracy. Further, it is shown that the performance of the AS algorithm is significantly better than that of the Max Voting algorithm adopted in other studies.

Machine Learning techniques provide new insight into the understanding of brain function in healthy subjects and patients with neurological and mental disorders. Here we introduce the application of machine learning to resonance imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG). The article provides a brief overview of the theoretical concept of machine learning and its types: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The potential of machine learning applications in pathology is discussed. Differences between EEG and fMRI methods regarding machine learning application and an overview of the techniques employed in different research studies are reviewed.

Successful single trial classification holds potential for translation into the clinical realm for real-time detection of memory and other cognitive states to provide real-time interventions (i.e., brain-computer interfaces). However, most of these stud-ies -and classification analyses in general - do not make clear if the chosen methodology is optimally suited for the classification of memory-related brain states. To address this problem, we systematically compared different methods for every step of classification (i.e., feature extraction, feature selection, classifier selection) to investi-gate which methods work best for decoding episodic memory brain states -the first analysis of its kind. Using an adult lifespan sample EEG dataset collected during performance of an episodic context encoding and retrieval task, we found that no specific feature type (including Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)-based features, mean, vari -ance, correlation, features based on AR model, entropy, phase, and phase synchronization) outperformed others consistently in distinguishing different memory classes. However, extracting all of these feature types consistently outperformed extracting only one type of feature. Additionally, the combination of filtering and sequential for-ward selection was the optimal method to select the effective features compared to filtering alone or performing no feature selection at all. Moreover, although all classifiers performed at a fairly similar level, LASSO was con-sistently the highest performing classifier compared to other commonly used options (i.e., naive Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression) while naive Bayes was the fastest classifier. Lastly, for multiclass classification (i.e., levels of context memory confidence and context feature perception), generalizing the binary classification using the binary decision tree performed better than the voting or one versus rest method. These methods were shown to outperform alternative approaches for three orthogonal datasets (i.e., EEG working memory, EEG motor imagery, and MEG working memory), supporting their generalizability. Our results provide an optimized methodological process for classifying single-trial neural data and provide important insight and recommendations for a cognitive neuroscientist's ability to make informed choices at all stages of the classification process for predicting memory and other cognitive states.

Nowadays artificial intelligence-based systems have been proposed to classify EEG signals to ease diagnosis process. However, machine learning models have generally been used deep learning based classification model to reach high classification accuracies. This work focuses classification epilepsy attacks using EEG signals with a lightweight and simple classification model. Hence, an automated EEG classification model is presented. The used phases of the presented automated EEG classification model are (i) multileveled feature generation using one-dimensional (1D) octal-pattern (OP) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Here, main feature generation function is the presented octal-pattern. DWT is employed for level creation. By employing DWT frequency coefficients of the EEG signal is obtained and octal-pattern generates texture features from raw EEG signal and wavelet coefficients. This DWT and octal-pattern based feature generator extracts 128 x 8 = 1024 (Octal-pattern generates 128 features from a signal, 8 signal are used in the feature generation 1 raw EEG and 7 wavelet low-pass filter coefficients). (ii) To select the most useful features, neighborhood component analysis (NCA) is deployed and 128 features are selected. (iii) The selected features are feed to k nearest neighborhood classifier. To test this model, an epilepsy seizure dataset is used and 96.0% accuracy is attained for five categories. The results clearly denoted the success of the presented octal-pattern based epilepsy classification model.

During the past few years, many approaches have been explored in terms of types of neurological sources of information, feature extraction, and intention prediction for BCI applications. Two novel aspects are becoming increasingly interesting for the BCI community: BC modeling and DL. The former aims at describing the interactions among different brain regions as connectivity patterns that reflect the dynamics of information flow either at rest or when performing a task. The latter is becoming pervasive for its capability of modeling and predicting complex data, where a huge amount of information is involved. In this scenario, we conducted a systematic literature review on BCI studies that led to the selection of 34 articles meeting all the required criteria. This provides evidence of the rapid growth of the topic over the past few years, though being still in its infancy. The last part of this article is dedicated to this new frontier of BCI that we call MI BC-based computer interfaces highlighting the potential of BC features. This, jointly with DL as enabling technology, has the potential of improving the performance of electroencephalography-based systems.

Besides, EEG is so weak and non-stationary that easily causes distribution discrepancies for EEG data collected at different times; therefore, it is necessary to explore the affective activation patterns in cross-session emotion recognition. To address these two problems, we propose a self-weighted semi-supervised classification (SWSC) model in this article for joint EEG-based cross-session emotion recognition and affective activation patterns mining, whose merits include: 1) using both the labeled and unlabeled samples from different sessions for better capturing data characteristics; 2) introducing a self-weighted variable to learn the importance of EEG features adaptively and quantitatively; and 3) mining the activation patterns including the critical EEG frequency bands and channels automatically based on the learned self-weighted variable. Extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark SEED_IV emotional dataset and SWSC obtained excellent average accuracies of 77.40%, 79.55%, and 81.52% in three cross-session emotion recognition tasks. Moreover, SWSC identifies that the Gamma frequency band contributes the most and the EEG channels in prefrontal, left/right temporal, and (central) parietal lobes are more important for cross-session emotion recognition.

Although prior research has achieved efficient single-task classification, scatted studies on cross-task mental workload assessment usually result in unsatisfactory performance. Here, we introduce a data-driven analysis framework to overcome the challenges regarding task-independent workload assessment using a fusion of EEG spectral characteristics and unveil the common neural mechanisms underlying mental workload. Specifically, multi-frequency power spectrum and functional connectivity (FC) were estimated for two workload levels in two working-memory tasks performed by 40 healthy participants, subsequently being fed into a machine learning approach to obtain the importance of each feature vector and evaluate classification performance in a cross-task fashion. Our framework achieved a classification accuracy of 0.94 for task-independent mental workload discrimination. Further investigation of the designated features in terms of their spectral and localization properties revealed task-independent common patterns in the neural mechanisms governing workload. In particular, increased workload was associated with elevated frontal delta and theta power but reduced parietal alpha power, whereas FC exhibited complex frequency- and region-dependent alterations. By implication, the employment of the EEG feature fusion emphasized their utility in serving as promising indicators for different workload conditions applications.

Extensions and Application of the Robust Shared Response Model to Electroencephalography Data for Enhancing Brain-Computer Interface Systems	2021 SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION ENGINEERING DESIGN SYMPOSIUM (IEEE SIEDS 2021)			English	Proceedings Paper	Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (IEEE SIEDS)	APR 29-30, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; Machine learning		Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) decode electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from the human brain to predict subsequent behavior. While this technology has promising applications, successfully implementing a model is challenging. The typical BCI control application requires many hours of training data from each individual to make predictions of intended activity specific to that individual. Moreover, there are individual differences in the organization of brain activity and low signal-to-noise ratios in noninvasive measurement techniques such as EEG. There is a fundamental bias-variance trade-off between developing a single model for all human brains vs. an individual model for each specific human brain. The Robust Shared Response Model (RSRM) attempts to resolve this tradeoff by leveraging both the homogeneity and heterogeneity of brain signals across people. RSRM extracts components that are common and shared across individual brains, while simultaneously learning unique representations between individual brains. By learning a latent shared space in conjunction with subject-specific representations, RSRM tends to result in better predictive performance on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data relative to other common dimension reduction techniques. To our knowledge, we are the first research team attempting to expand the domain of RSRM by applying this technique to controlled experimental EEG data in a BCI setting. Using the openly available Motor Movement/ Imagery dataset, the decoding accuracy of RSRM exceeded models whose input was reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and subject-specific PCA. The results of our experiments suggest that RSRM can recover distributed latent brain signals and improve decoding accuracy of BCI tasks when dimension reduction is implemented as a feature engineering step. Future directions of this work include augmenting state-of-the art BCI with efficient reduced representations extracted by RSRM. This could enhance the utility of BCI technology in the real world. Furthermore, RSRM could have wide-ranging applications across other machine-learning applications that require classification of naturalistic data using reduced representations.

Separability of Motor Imagery Directions Using Subject-Specific Discriminative EEG Features	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Kinematics; Task analysis; Man-machine systems; Data mining; Trajectory; Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs); electroencephalography; feature extraction; motor imagery (MI) kinematics; phase locking values (PLVs)	CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) is an augmented communication modality between the brain and computer that exclusively depends on noninvasively recorded neuro-electrical activity. To establish multiple control commands in BCI systems, it is essential to efficiently identify unique EEG activation patterns underlying multiple motor tasks. This article investigates the brain activation modulations elicited by imagined movement directions and the EEG features that characterize them. An experiment was conducted in which ten subjects imagined two-dimensional right-hand movement in the left, right, up, and down directions in the vertical plane. The frequency and phase characteristics of EEG rhythms are explored to identify the features that discriminate movement imagination toward multiple directions. The proposed decoding step consists of Fisher's analysis of instantaneous phase values to identify EEG channels with optimal discriminative information followed by extraction of phase-locking values and temporal-spatial features, which are then used for classification. The proposed approach offers significantly higher (p < 0.05) performance than the state-of-the-art method while employing subject-specific time segments and channels. Hence, an average accuracy of 69.25% is obtained for binary classification of all pairs of movement directions with a performance increment of 8.33% compared to the conventional approaches using fixed channel-time paradigm. The results illustrate the potential use of noninvasive EEG signals in decoding imagined movement kinematics, and further research is needed to investigate and optimize the separability in multiple directions.

Moreover, EEG signals can be used in several areas such as emotion recognition, driving fatigue detection. This work presents a new emotion recognition model by using EEG signals. The primary aim of this model is to present a highly accurate emotion recognition framework by using both a hand-crafted feature generation and a deep classifier. The presented framework uses a multilevel fused feature generation network. This network has three primary phases, which are tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), statistical feature generation, and nonlinear textural feature generation phases. TQWT is applied to the EEG data for decomposing signals into different sub-bands and create a multilevel feature generation network. In the nonlinear feature generation, an S-box of the LED block cipher is utilized to create a pattern, which is named as Led-Pattern. Moreover, statistical feature extraction is processed using the widely used statistical moments. The proposed LED pattern and statistical feature extraction functions are applied to 18 TQWT sub-bands and an original EEG signal. Therefore, the proposed hand-crafted learning model is named LEDPatNet19. To select the most informative features, ReliefF and iterative Chi2 (RFIChi2) feature selector is deployed. The proposed model has been developed on the two EEG emotion datasets, which are GAMEEMO and DREAMER datasets. Our proposed hand-crafted learning network achieved 94.58%, 92.86%, and 94.44% classification accuracies for arousal, dominance, and valance cases of the DREAMER dataset. Furthermore, the best classification accuracy of the proposed model for the GAMEEMO dataset is equal to 99.29%. These results clearly illustrate the success of the proposed LEDPatNet19.

Among the limb motion, sign language not only contains rich semantic information and abundant maneuverable actions but also provides different executable commands. However, many researchers focus on decoding the gross motor skills, such as the decoding of ordinary motor imagery or simple upper limb movements. Here we explored the neural features and decoding of Chinese sign language from electroencephalograph (EEG) signal with motor imagery and motor execution. Sign language not only contains rich semantic information, but also has abundant maneuverable actions, and provides us with more different executable commands. In this paper, twenty subjects were instructed to perform movement execution and movement imagery based on Chinese sign language. Seven classifiers are employed to classify the selected features of sign language EEG. L1 regularization is used to learn and select features that contain more information from the mean, power spectral density, sample entropy, and brain network connectivity. The best average classification accuracy of the classifier is 89.90% (imagery sign language is 83.40%). These results have shown the feasibility of decoding between different sign languages. The source location reveals that the neural circuits involved in sign language are related to the visual contact area and the pre-movement area. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed decoding strategy based on sign language can obtain outstanding classification results, which provides a certain reference value for the subsequent research of limb decoding based on sign language.

Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which diagnosis is usually challenging. Biomarkers are needed for diagnosis and monitoring. In this study, we aimed to evaluate Electroencephalography (EEG) as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PPA. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 40 PPA patients categorized as non-fluent, semantic, and logopenic variants, and 20 controls. Resting-state EEG with 32 channels was acquired and preprocessed using several procedures (quantitative EEG, wavelet transformation, autoencoders, and graph theory analysis). Seven machine learning algorithms were evaluated (Decision Tree, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Multinomial Naive Bayes). Results. Diagnostic capacity to distinguish between PPA and controls was high (accuracy 75%, F1-score 83% for kNN algorithm). The most important features in the classification were derived from network analysis based on graph theory. Conversely, discrimination between PPA variants was lower (Accuracy 58% and F1-score 60% for kNN). Conclusions.

J	Ramzan, M; Dawn, S				Ramzan, Munaza; Dawn, Suma			Fused CNN-LSTM deep learning emotion recognition model using electroencephalography signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Electroencephalography; Database of Emotion analysis using Physiological signals; SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset; Deep Learning; Convolution Neural Network		Introduction: The traditional machine learning-based emotion recognition models have shown effective performance for classifying Electroencephalography (EEG) based emotions. Methods: The different machine learning algorithms outperform the various EEG based emotion models for valence and arousal. But the downside is to devote numerous efforts to designing features from the given noisy signals which are also a very time-consuming process. The Deep Learning analysis overcomes the hand-engineered feature extraction and selection problems. Results: In this study, the Database of Emotion analysis using Physiological signals (DEAP) has been visualized to classify High-Arousal- Low-Arousal (HALA), High-Valence-Low-Valence (HVLV), familiarity, Dominance and Liking emotions. The fusion of deep learning models, namely CNN and LSTM-RNN seems to perform better for the analysis of emotions using EEG signals. The average accuracies analyzed by the fused deep learning classification model for DEAP are 97.39%, 97.41%, 98.21%, 97.68%, and 97.89% for HALA, HVLV, familiarity, dominance and liking respectively. The model has been evaluated over the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) dataset too for the detection of positive and negative emotions, which results with an average accuracy of 93.74%. Conclusion: The results show that the developed model can classify the inner emotions of different EEG based emotion databases.

However, most EEG measures previously used are either a univariate measure or a single type of brain connectivity, which may not fully capture the abnormal brain changes of SZ patients. In this paper, event-related potentials were collected from 45 SZ patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) during a learning task, and then a combination of partial directed coherence (PDC) effective and phase lag index (PLI) functional connectivity were used as features to train a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation for classification of SZ from HCs. Our results indicated that an excellent classification performance (accuracy = 95.16%, specificity = 94.44%, and sensitivity = 96.15%) was obtained when the combination of functional and effective connectivity features was used, and the corresponding optimal feature number was 15, which included 12 PDC and three PLI connectivity features. The selected effective connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal/central and visual/parietal lobes, and the selected functional connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal and visual cortexes of the right hemisphere. In addition, most of the selected effective connectivity abnormally enhanced in SZ patients compared with HCs, whereas all the selected functional connectivity features decreased in SZ patients. The above results showed that our proposed method has great potential to become a tool for the auxiliary diagnosis of SZ.

Previous studies often tried to decode EEG signals modulated by a picture of complex object. However, it's still unclear how a simple image with different positions and orientations influence the EEG signals. To this end, this study used a same white bar with eight different spatial patterns as visual stimuli. Convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) was employed to decode the corresponding EEG signals. Four subjects were recruited in this study. As a result, the highest binary classification accuracy could reach 97.2% 95.7%, 90.2%, and 88.3% for the four subjects, respectively. Almost all subjects could achieve more than 70% for 4-class classification. The results demonstrate basic graphic shapes are decodable from EEG signals, which hold promise for image decoding of EEG-based BCIs.

Because of the nature of EEG signals, their interpretation and classification require an expert. Recently, machine learning algorithms for EEG analysis have gained popularity and are applied in various activities such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI), diagnostic of brain disorders, etc. In this work, an EEG classification was performed with different machine learning algorithms. For this, Support Vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB) and Ensemble were implemented and the performance of different algorithms when distinguishing between two classes: one of movement and one of inactivity. The movement class was composed of Motor Imagery(MI) data and actual movement and inactivity class of a baseline. From the proposed techniques for EEG classification, the QDA and NB achieve the highest accuracy.

Enhanced analysis and classification of EEG signals can help improve performance in classifying the disorders and abnormalities. A new approach is examined here for enhancing EEG classification performance using a novel model of data representation that leverages knowledge of spatial layout of EEG sensors. An investigation of the performance of the proposed data representation model provides evidence of consistently higher classification accuracy of the proposed model compared with a model that ignores the sensor layout. The performance is assessed for models that represent the information content of the EEG signals in two different ways: a one-dimensional concatenation of the channels of the frequency bands and a proposed image-like two-dimensional representation of the EEG channel locations. The models are used in conjunction with different machine learning techniques. Performance of these models is examined on two tasks: social anxiety disorder classification, and emotion recognition using a dataset, DEAP, for emotion analysis using physiological signals. We hypothesize that the proposed two-dimensional model will significantly outperform the one-dimensional model and this is validated in our results as this model consistently yields 5-8% higher accuracy in all machine learning algorithms investigated. Among the algorithms investigated, Convolutional Neural Networks provide the best performance, far exceeding that of Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms.

J	Yang, L; Song, YH; Ma, K; Su, EZ; Xie, LH				Yang, Lie; Song, Yonghao; Ma, Ke; Su, Enze; Xie, Longhan			A novel motor imagery EEG decoding method based on feature separation	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain&#8211; computer interface (BCI) systems; motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) decoding; feature separation; adversarial learning		Objective. Motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) decoding is a vital technology for the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems and has been widely studied in recent years. However, the original EEG signals usually contain a lot of class-independent information, and the existing motor imagery EEG decoding methods are easily interfered by this irrelevant information, which greatly limits the decoding accuracy of these methods. Approach. To overcome the interference of the class-independent information, a motor imagery EEG decoding method based on feature separation is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, a feature separation network based on adversarial learning (FSNAL) is designed for the feature separation of the original EEG samples. First, the class-related features and class-independent features are separated by the proposed FSNAL framework, and then motor imagery EEG decoding is performed only according to the class-related features to avoid the adverse effects of class-independent features. Main results. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed motor imagery EEG decoding method, we conduct some experiments on two public EEG datasets (the BCI competition IV 2a and 2b datasets). The experimental results comparison between our method and some state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that our motor imagery EEG decoding method outperforms all the compared methods on the two experimental datasets. Significance. Our motor imagery EEG decoding method can alleviate the interference of class-independent features, and it has great application potential for improving the performance of motor imagery BCI systems in the near future.

Researchers have used MI signals to help people with partial or total paralysis, control devices such as exoskeletons, wheelchairs, prostheses, and even independent driving. Therefore, classifying the motor imagery tasks of these signals is important for a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system. Classifying the MI tasks from EEG signals is difficult to offer a good decoder due to the dynamic nature of the signal, its low signal-to-noise ratio, complexity, and dependence on the sensor positions. In this paper, we investigate five multilayer methods for classifying MI tasks: proposed methods based on Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network 1 (CNN1), CNN2, CNN1 with CNN2 merged, and the modified CNN1 with CNN2 merged. These proposed methods use different spatial and temporal characteristics extracted from raw EEG data. We demonstrate that our proposed CNN1-based method outperforms state-of-the-art machine/deep learning techniques for EEG classification by an accuracy value of 68.77% and use spatial and frequency characteristics on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset, which includes nine subjects performing four MI tasks (left/right hand, feet, and tongue). The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this proposed method for the classification of MI-EEG signals and can be applied successfully to BCI systems where the amount of data is large due to daily recording.

EEG-based motor imagery classification using digraph Fourier transforms and extreme learning machines	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Motor imagery; Classification; Multivariate autoregressive models; Graph signals; Graph Fourier transform	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; IMPROVING CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION-FLOW; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; FILTER	Motor imagery patterns are extensively exploited in brain-computer interface systems in order to control outer devices without using peripheral nerves or muscles. Classification of these patterns can be based on the associated electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Recent approaches addressed this classification problem through techniques exploiting mainly information from one or two EEG channels. However, these approaches overlook correlations between multiple EEG channels. In this paper, we create motor-imagery classification systems based on graph-theoretic models of multichannel EEG signals. In particular, multivariate autoregressive models are used to establish the relations between the EEG channels and construct directed graph signals. Also, we constructed undirected graph signal models with Gaussian-weighted distances between graph nodes. Then, a novel variant of the graph Fourier transform is applied to the directed and undirected graph models with and without edge weights. Distinctive features were thus extracted from the transform coefficients. Additional features were computed using common spatial patterns, polynomial representations and principal components of EEG signals. Significant performance improvements were achieved using extreme learning machine (ELM) classifiers. For Dataset Ia of the BCI Competition 2003, our approach led to a classification accuracy of 96.58% with fullyconnected weighted directed graph features computed on the delta-band EEG signals. For the six subjects of the Dataset 1 of the BCI Competition IV, our approach compared well with other state-of-the-art methods in the alpha and beta EEG bands.	[Annaby, M.

However, the problem of subject-specific frequency band selection occurs frequently in spatial feature extraction. In this study, to enhance the frequency information in a spatial filter, we design an upper triangle filter bank to determine discriminative frequency components and apply the common spatial pattern to extract spatial features from subbands. Furthermore, an autoencoder neural network is constructed to reduce the high dimensionality of spatial features. The classification performance of the proposed method is experimentally evaluated on motor imagery datasets. The proposed method provides more discriminative features and higher classification performance in comparison with competing algorithms. This proposed filter bank method can be used to extend the other spatial and spectral processing method for motor imagery classification.

The functionality of the brain can be obtained from brain signals and it is vital to analyze and examine the brain signals in seizure detection processes. In this study, we performed machine learning-based and signal processing methods to detect epileptic signals. To do that, we examined three different EEG signals (healthy, ictal, and interictal) with two different classes (healthy ones and epileptic ones). Our proposed method consists of three stages which are preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In the preprocessing phase, EEG signals normalized to scale all samples into [0,1] range. After Stockwell Transform was applied and chaotic features and Parseval's Energy collected from each EEG signal. In the last part, EEG signals were classified with ELM (Extreme Learning Machines) with different parameters. Our study shows the best classification accuracy obtained from the Sigmoid activation function with the number of 100 hidden neurons. The highlights of this study are: Stockwell Transform is used; Entropy values are selected based on the adaptive process. Threshold values are determined according to the error rates; ELM classifier algorithm is applied.

Eventually, L2 can conjure as rich a semantic representation as our native language (L1). However, the neural processes for mapping a new orthographic representation to a familiar meaning are not well understood or characterized. Methods Using electroencephalography and an artificial language that maps symbols to English words, we show that it is possible to use machine learning models to detect a newly formed semantic mapping as it is acquired. Results Through a trial-by-trial analysis, we show that we can detect when a new semantic mapping is formed. Our results show that, like word meaning representations evoked by a L1, the localization of the newly formed neural representations is highly distributed, but the representation may emerge more slowly after the onset of the symbol. Furthermore, our mapping of word meanings to symbols removes the confound of the semantics to the visual characteristics of the stimulus, a confound that has been difficult to disentangle previously. Conclusion We have shown that the L1 semantic representation conjured by a newly acquired L2 word can be detected using decoding techniques, and we give the first characterization of the emergence of that mapping. Our work opens up new possibilities for the study of semantic representations during L2 learning.

Machine learning combined with non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) has recently been shown to have the potential to diagnose MDD. However, most of these studies analyzed small samples of participants recruited from a single source, raising serious concerns about the generalizability of these results in clinical practice. Thus, it has become critical to re-evaluate the efficacy of various common EEG features for MDD detection across large and diverse datasets. To address this issue, we collected resting-state EEG data from 400 participants across four medical centers and tested classification performance of four common EEG features: band power (BP), coherence, Higuchi's fractal dimension, and Katz's fractal dimension. Then, a sequential backward selection (SBS) method was used to determine the optimal subset. To overcome the large data variability due to an increased data size and multi-site EEG recordings, we introduced the conformal kernel (CK) transformation to further improve the MDD as compared with the healthy control (HC) classification performance of support vector machine (SVM). The results show that (1) coherence features account for 98% of the optimal feature subset; (2) the CK-SVM outperforms other classifiers such as K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and SVM; (3) the combination of the optimal feature subset and CK-SVM achieves a high five-fold cross-validation accuracy of 91.07% on the training set (140 MDD and 140 HC) and 84.16% on the independent test set (60 MDD and 60 HC). The current results suggest that the coherence-based connectivity is a more reliable feature for achieving high and generalizable MDD detection performance in real-life clinical practice.

Auditory attention in complex scenarios can be decoded by electroencephalography (EEG)-based cortical speech-envelope tracking. The relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity is a valuable cue for the decomposition of speech into distinct characteristic segments. To improve auditory attention decoding (AAD) performance, this work proposed a novel segmented AAD approach to decode target speech envelopes from different RMS-level-based speech segments. Approach. Speech was decomposed into higher- and lower-RMS-level speech segments with a threshold of -10 dB relative RMS level. A support vector machine classifier was designed to identify higher- and lower-RMS-level speech segments, using clean target and mixed speech as reference signals based on corresponding EEG signals recorded when subjects listened to target auditory streams in competing two-speaker auditory scenes. Segmented computational models were developed with the classification results of higher- and lower-RMS-level speech segments. Speech envelopes were reconstructed based on segmented decoding models for either higher- or lower-RMS-level speech segments. AAD accuracies were calculated according to the correlations between actual and reconstructed speech envelopes. The performance of the proposed segmented AAD computational model was compared to those of traditional AAD methods with unified decoding functions. Main results. Higher- and lower-RMS-level speech segments in continuous sentences could be identified robustly with classification accuracies that approximated or exceeded 80% based on corresponding EEG signals at 6 dB, 3 dB, 0 dB, -3 dB and -6 dB signal-to-mask ratios (SMRs). Compared with unified AAD decoding methods, the proposed segmented AAD approach achieved more accurate results in the reconstruction of target speech envelopes and in the detection of attentional directions. Moreover, the proposed segmented decoding method had higher information transfer rates (ITRs) and shorter minimum expected switch times compared with the unified decoder. Significance. This study revealed that EEG signals may be used to classify higher- and lower-RMS-level-based speech segments across a wide range of SMR conditions (from 6 dB to -6 dB). A novel finding was that the specific information in different RMS-level-based speech segments facilitated EEG-based decoding of auditory attention. The significantly improved AAD accuracies and ITRs of the segmented decoding method suggests that this proposed computational model may be an effective method for the application of neuro-controlled brain-computer interfaces in complex auditory scenes.

However, existing decoding models are built under the attended state while subjects perform motion tasks. In practice, people are often distracted by other tasks or environmental factors, which may impair decoding performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical decoding model of human upper limb motion intention from EEG signals based on attention state estimation. The proposed decoding model includes two components. First, the attention state detection (ASD) component estimates the attention state during the upper limb movement. Next, the motion intention recognition (MIR) component decodes the motion intention by using the decoding models built under the attended and distracted states. The experimental results show that the proposed hierarchical decoding model performs well under the attended and distracted states. This work can advance the application of human movement intention decoding and provides new insights into the study of brain-machine interfaces.

This allows for studies to be carried outside lab settings, as well as many commercial applications. As recordings are done over extended periods, these devices generate large volumes of data, mainly if the neuronal activity is recorded through multiple channels. Machine learning (ML) techniques allow to effectively analyse and use this data for a wide range of applications. However the portability of these techniques can be challenging.

Past research relied mostly on penile plethysmography (PPG). Even though this technique is the standard protocol used in most current forensic settings, its usage showed mixed results. One way to improve PPG is the addition of other psychophysiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG generates significant amount of data that hinders classification. Machine learning (ML) is nowadays an excellent tool to identify most discriminating variables and for classification. Therefore, it is proposed to use ML selection and extraction methods for dimensionality reduction and then to classify sexual preferences. Evidence from this proof of concept shows that using EEG and PPG together leads to better classification (85.6%) than using EEG (82.2%) or PPG individually (74.4%). The Random Forest (RF) classifier combined with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) extraction method achieves a slightly higher general performance rate. This increase in performances opens the door for using more reliable biometric measures in the assessment of deviant sexual preferences.

Despite the recent progress, exactly which aspects of neural activities are characterizing the decoding process is still unclear. Neural oscillations have been associated with playing a key functional role in neural information processing and thus might provide significant insight into the decoding process. Previous research has investigated a limited range of neural frequencies for decoding, usually the high-gamma oscillations (70 - 200 Hz) in electrocorticography (ECoG) and lower-frequency waves (1 - 70 Hz) in electroencephalography (EEG). Hence, the exact contribution of specific frequency bands is still unclear. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive method for directly measuring underlying brain activity and has the temporal resolution needed to investigate the role of cortical oscillations in speech decoding, which we attempted in this study. We used three machine learning classifiers (linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) to classify different imagined and spoken phrases for finding the role of brainwaves in speech decoding. The experimental results showed a significant contribution of low-frequency Delta oscillations (0.1 - 4 Hz) in decoding and the best performance was achieved when all the brainwaves were combined.

In our previous study, the synchronous hybrid mental tasks have been proposed with higher classification accuracy. In this study, to analyze the superiority of synchronous hybrid mental tasks, the causal networks of synchronous hybrid mental tasks and single mental tasks are compared. The causal networks are based on functional connectivity, which is calculated by partial directed coherence. The networks of the synchronous hybrid mental tasks present different interaction patterns. To further improve the classification accuracy of EEG signals, a feature extraction method combining the causal network and common spatial pattern (CSP) is proposed. After combining as mixed feature vectors, they are selected by binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization. The optimal feature subsets are classified by extreme learning machine. This average result is 3.1% and 9.5% higher than CSP and causal flow, respectively. The superiority of hybrid experimental paradigm can be studied by the causal network, and the performance of BCIs is also improved.

Emotion recognition through machine intelligence plays criti-cal role in understanding the brain activities as well as in developing decision-making systems. In this research, an automated EEG based emotion recognition method with a novel fractal pattern feature ex-traction approach is presented. The presented fractal pattern is inspired by Firat University Logo and named fractal Firat pattern (FFP). By using FFP and Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT) signal decomposition technique, a multilevel feature generator is presented. In the feature selection phase, an improved iterative selector is utilized. The shallow classifiers have been considered to denote the success of the presented TQWT and FFP based feature generation. This model has been tested on emotional EEG signals with 14 channels using linear discriminant (LDA), k-nearest neighborhood (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM).

Convolutional neural networks (ConvNet) have improved the state-of-theart of motor imagery decoding in an end-to-end approach. However, shallow ConvNets usually perform better than their deep counterparts. Thus, we aim to design a novel ConvNet that is deeper than the existing models, with an increase in terms of performances, and with optimal complexity. New method: We develop a ConvNet based on Inception and Xception architectures that uses convolutional layers to extract temporal and spatial features. We adopt separable convolutions and depthwise convolutions to enable faster and efficient ConvNet. Then, we introduce a new block that is inspired by Inception to learn more rich features to improve the classification performances. Results: The obtained results are comparable with other state-of-the-art techniques. Also, the weights of the convolutional layers give us some insights onto the learned features and reveal the most relevant ones. Comparison with existing method(s): We show that our model significantly outperforms Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP), Riemannian Geometry (RG) approaches, and ShallowConvNet (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The obtained results prove that motor imagery decoding is possible without handcrafted features.

Misalignment of the auditory neural impairment may impose challenges in processing incoming auditory stimulus that can be measured using electroencephalography (EEG). The electrophysiological behaviour response emanated from EEG auditory evoked potential (AEP) requires highly trained professionals for analysis and interpretation. Reliable automated methods using techniques of machine learning would assist the auditory assessment process for informed treatment and practice. It is thus highly required to develop models that are more efficient and precise by considering the characteristics of brain signals. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of several state-of-the-art techniques of machine learning that adopt EEG evoked response for the auditory assessment within the last 13 years. Out of 161 initially screened articles, 11 were retained for synthesis. The outcome of the review presented that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier outperformed with over 80% accuracy metric and was recognized as the best suited model within the field of auditory research. This paper discussed the comprehensive iterative properties of the proposed computed algorithms and the feasible future direction in hearing impaired rehabilitation.

In the literature, patient's electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for an epilepsy diagnosis. However, the success of epileptic examination procedures from quantitative EEG signals is limited. In this paper, a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation called Synchrosqueezed Transform (SST) is used to classify epileptic EEG signals. The SST matrices of seizure and pre-seizure EEG data of 16 epilepsy patients are calculated. Two approaches based on machine learning and deep learning are proposed to classify pre-seizure and seizure signals. In the machine learning-based approach, the various features like higher-order joint moments are calculated and these features are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. In the deep learning-based approach, the SST matrix was recorded as an image and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture was used to classify these images. Simulation results demonstrate that both approaches achieved promising validation accuracy rates. While the maximum (90.2%) validation accuracy is achieved for the machine learning-based approach, (90.3%) validation accuracy is achieved for the deep learning-based approach.

We retrospectively collected data from medical records, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores from psychological assessments, and quantitative EEG (QEEG) at resting-state assessments from 945 subjects [850 patients with major psychiatric disorders (six large-categorical and nine specific disorders) and 95 healthy controls (HCs)]. A combination of QEEG parameters including power spectrum density (PSD) and functional connectivity (FC) at frequency bands was used to establish models for the binary classification between patients with each disorder and HCs. The support vector machine, random forest, and elastic net ML methods were applied, and prediction performances were compared. The elastic net model with IQ adjustment showed the highest accuracy. The best feature combinations and classification accuracies for discrimination between patients and HCs with adjusted IQ were as follows: schizophrenia = alpha PSD, 93.83%; trauma and stress-related disorders = beta FC, 91.21%; anxiety disorders = whole band PSD, 91.03%; mood disorders = theta FC, 89.26%; addictive disorders = theta PSD, 85.66%; and obsessive-compulsive disorder = gamma FC, 74.52%.

The most common electrophysiological signal source is EOG that contaminated the EEG signal and thereby decreases the accuracy of measurement and the predicated signal strength. In this study, we introduce a method to improve the correction efficiency for EOG artifacts (EOAs) on raw EEG recordings: We retrieve cerebral information from three EEG signals with high system performance and accuracy by applying feature engineering and a novel machine-learning (ML) procedure. To this end, we use two adaptive algorithms for signal decomposition to remove EOAs from multichannel EEG signals: empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), both using the Hilbert-Huang transform. First, the signal components are decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions. Next, statistical feature extraction and dimension reduction using principal component analysis are employed to select optimal feature sets for the ML procedure that is based on classification and regression models. The proposed CEEMD algorithm enhances the accuracy compared to the EMD algorithm and considerably improves the multi-sensory classification of EEG signals. Models of three different categories are applied, and the classification is based on a K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm, a decision tree (DT) algorithm, and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with accuracies of 94% for K-NN, 75% for DT, and 69% for SVM. For each classification model, a regression learner is used to assist as an evidence rule for the proposed artificial system and to influence the learning process from classification and regression models. The regression learning algorithms applied include algorithms based on an ensemble of trees (ET), a DT, and a SVM. We find that the ET-based regression model exhibits a determination coefficient R2 = 1.00 outperforming the other two approaches with R2 = 0.80 for DT and R2 = 0.76 for SVM.

Due to its great potential application for the neuro-steered hearing devices, auditory attention decoding has recently received increasing attention. In practice, development of high-accuracy decoding performance and use of EEG signals with as short duration as possible are urgently needed for auditory attention decoding in real-time scenarios. However, these are still great challenges for the existing decoding methods to achieve such performances. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear modeling approach between EEG signals and speech envelopes by exploiting long short-term memory networks (LSTM), a special structure of recurrent neural networks (RNN), to decipher selective auditory attention from single-trial EEG signals, which is capable of learning long-term dependencies between EEG responses and continuous auditory stimuli. Unlike the existing linear modeling approaches, the LSTM RNN-based auditory attention decoding method is an end-to-end nonlinear decoding framework that subsumes the explicit similarity determination as part of feature learning in deep neural networks. The proposed decoding method is evaluated using the real EEG data collected from 21 subjects. Experimental results show that our proposed decoding method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance to identify the target speech in a competing two-talker scenario. When used the EEG signals with 1 s duration, the average accuracy for the 21 subjects' attention decoding is reached to 96.12%. The results show great potentials for the real-time auditory attention detection in neuro-steered hearing aids.

EEG is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, which can be used to decode user intentions. Because the feature space of EEG data is highly dimensional and signal patterns are specific to the subject, appropriate methods for feature representation are required to enhance the decoding accuracy of the CNN model. Furthermore, neural changes exhibit high variability between sessions, subjects within a single session, and trials within a single subject, resulting in major issues during the modeling stage. In addition, there are many subject-dependent factors, such as frequency ranges, time intervals, and spatial locations at which the signal occurs, which prevent the derivation of a robust model that can achieve the parameterization of these factors for a wide range of subjects. However, previous studies did not attempt to preserve the multivariate structure and dependencies of the feature space. In this study, we propose a method to generate a spatiospectral feature representation that can preserve the multivariate information of EEG data. Specifically, 3-D feature maps were constructed by combining subject-optimized and subject-independent spectral filters and by stacking the filtered data into tensors. In addition, a layer-wise decomposition model was implemented using our 3-D-CNN framework to secure reliable classification results on a single-trial basis. The average accuracies of the proposed model were 87.15% (+/- 7.31), 75.85% (+/- 12.80), and 70.37% (+/- 17.09) for the BCI competition data sets IV_2a, IV_2b, and OpenBMI data, respectively. These results are better than those obtained by state-of-the-art techniques, and the decomposition model obtained the relevance scores for neurophysiologically plausible electrode channels and frequency domains, confirming the validity of the proposed approach.

Artificial Intelligence in Epilepsy	NEUROLOGY INDIA			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; deep learning; epilepsy	SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; FEATURES; ENTROPY; MODEL	Background: The study of seizure patterns in electroencephalography (EEG) requires several years of intensive training. In addition, inadequate training and human error may lead to misinterpretation and incorrect diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated seizure detection systems hold an exciting potential to create paradigms for proper diagnosis and interpretation. AI holds the promise to transform healthcare into a system where machines and humans can work together to provide an accurate, timely diagnosis, and treatment to the patients. Objective: This article presents a brief overview of research on the use of AI systems for pattern recognition in EEG for clinical diagnosis. Material and Methods: The article begins with the need for understanding nonstationary signals such as EEG and simplifying their complexity for accurate pattern recognition in medical diagnosis. It also explains the core concepts of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) methods. Results and Conclusions: In this present context of epilepsy diagnosis, AI may work in two ways; first by creating visual representations (e.g., color-coded paradigms), which allow persons with limited training to make a diagnosis. The second is by directly explaining a complete automated analysis, which of course requires more complex paradigms than the previous one. We also clarify that AI is not about replacing doctors and strongly emphasize the need for domain knowledge in building robust AI models that can work in real-time scenarios rendering good detection accuracy in a minimum amount of time.

A Survey on EEG Signal Processing Techniques and Machine Learning: Applications to the Neurofeedback of Autobiographical Memory Deficits in Schizophrenia	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						signal processing; machine learning; deep learning; electroencephalography (EEG); schizophrenia; autobiographical memory	BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; STIMULATION	In this paper, a general overview regarding neural recording, classical signal processing techniques and machine learning classification algorithms applied to monitor brain activity is presented. Currently, several approaches classified as electrical, magnetic, neuroimaging recordings and brain stimulations are available to obtain neural activity of the human brain. Among them, non-invasive methods like electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly employed, as they can provide a high degree of temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds) and acceptable space resolution. In addition, it is simple, quick, and does not create any physical harm or stress to patients. Concerning signal processing, once the neural signals are acquired, different procedures can be applied for feature extraction. In particular, brain signals are normally processed in time, frequency, and/or space domains. The features extracted are then used for signal classification depending on its characteristics such us the mean, variance or band power. The role of machine learning in this regard has become of key importance during the last years due to its high capacity to analyze complex amounts of data. The algorithms employed are generally classified in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement techniques. A deep review of the most used machine learning algorithms and the advantages/drawbacks of most used methods is presented. Finally, a study of these procedures utilized in a very specific and novel research field of electroencephalography, i.e., autobiographical memory deficits in schizophrenia, is outlined.

This has driven the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Brain wave signals are acquired using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, processed and decoded to identify the category to which the signal belongs. Once the signal category is determined, it can be used to control external devices. However, the success of such a system essentially relies on significant feature extraction and classification algorithms. One of the commonly used feature extraction technique for BCI systems is common spatial pattern (CSP). Results The performance of the proposed spatial-frequency-temporal feature extraction (SPECTRA) predictor is analysed using three public benchmark datasets. Our proposed predictor outperformed other competing methods achieving lowest average error rates of 8.55%, 17.90% and 20.26%, and highest average kappa coefficient values of 0.829, 0.643 and 0.595 for BCI Competition III dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV dataset I and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb, respectively. Conclusions Our proposed SPECTRA predictor effectively finds features that are more separable and shows improvement in brain wave signal recognition that can be instrumental in developing improved real-time BCI systems that are computationally efficient.

A lot of work is available for EEG based automatic seizure detection but very less attempts have been made towards the classification of variants of seizures. Moreover, none of the authors have included the EEG signals for myoclonic seizure type in their classification studies. Our study aims to propose the automatic machine learning based multi-class classification system for classifying six types of epileptic seizures (such as absence, focal non-specific, complex-partial, generalized, tonic-clonic and including myoclonic too) through the use of recurrence plots (RPs). In our study, we have collected 19-channel EEG data from a huge database of Temple University Hospital. Two classification modalities have been proposed depending upon the feature extraction approach followed for RPs- (a) Traditional approach using the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) method; (b) Texture based approach using the hybrid method named as Unthresholded Recurrence Plot with Fractal Weighted Local Binary Pattern (URP-FWLBP), that has been proposed in our work using a combination of Unthresholded RPs (URPs) and Fractal Weighted Local Binary Pattern (FWLBP) method. Thereby, an indirect variant of support vector machine (one-vs-rest approach) has been used as the multi-class classifier in both the approaches. The performance of the proposed modalities has been validated using five-fold cross-validation method in the light of seven metrics- accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, geometric-mean, precision and f1-score. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed system following hybrid URP-FWLBP method in performing multi-class epileptic seizure type classification with 100% efficiency, thereby outperforming the traditional RQA method based system as well the existing state-of-the-art systems.

The effectiveness of the CSP algorithm depends on optimal selection of the frequency band and time window from the EEG. Many algorithms have been designed to optimize frequency band selection for CSP, while few algorithms seek to optimize the time window. This study proposes a novel framework, termed common time-frequency-spatial patterns (CTFSP), to extract sparse CSP features from multi-band filtered EEG data in multiple time windows. Specifically, the whole MI period is first segmented into multiple subseries using a sliding time window approach. Then, sparse CSP features are extracted from multiple frequency bands in each time window. Finally, multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel are trained to identify the MI tasks and the voting result of these classifiers determines the final output of the BCI. This study applies the proposed CTFSP algorithm to three public EEG datasets (BCI competition III dataset IVa, BCI competition III dataset IIIa, and BCI competition IV dataset 1) to validate its effectiveness, compared against several other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for improving the performance of MI-BCI systems.

Dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation mimics non-rapid eye movement stage 3 sleep: large-scale validation using machine learning	SLEEP			English	Article						electroencephalogram; sedation monitoring; machine learning; dexmedetomidine; sleep	OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; PROPOFOL; DELIRIUM; CARE; MEN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; DESIGN	Study objectives: Dexmedetomidine-induced electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns during deep sedation are comparable with natural sleep patterns. Using large-scale EEG recordings and machine learning techniques, we investigated whether dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation indeed mimics natural sleep patterns. Methods: We used EEG recordings from three sources in this study: 8,707 overnight sleep EEG and 30 dexmedetomidine clinical trial EEG. Dexmedetomidine-induced sedation levels were assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We extracted 22 spectral features from each EEG recording using a multitaper spectral estimation method. Elastic-net regularization method was used for feature selection. We compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest), trained on individual sleep stages, to predict different levels of the MOAA/S sedation state. Results: The random forest algorithm trained on non-rapid eye movement stage 3 (N3) predicted dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation (MOAA/S = 0) with area under the receiver operator characteristics curve >0.8 outperforming other machine learning models. Power in the delta band (0-4 Hz) was selected as an important feature for prediction in addition to power in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (16-30 Hz) bands. Conclusions: Using a large-scale EEG data-driven approach and machine learning framework, we show that dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation state mimics N3 sleep EEG patterns.

High accuracy decoding of motor imagery directions from EEG-based brain computer interface using filter bank spatially regularised common spatial pattern method	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Motor imagery; Common spatial pattern; Regularisation; Event-related desynchronization; synchronization; Brain-computer interface	HAND MOVEMENT; CLASSIFICATION	One of the important requirements of a practical Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is the ability to establish multiple control commands corresponding to different kinematics of motor imagery. Most of the previous BCIbased motor imagery studies in literature focus on classifying left vs. right hand motor imagery from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Very few studies have reported decoding imagined hand movement kinematics from EEG-based BCI. The present study decodes the left vs. right directional information from the Motor Imagery (MI) of dominant hand movement using EEG-based BCI. The proposed method employs common spatial pattern (CSP) and its variants as features to decode imagined (motor imagery) bidirectional hand movements. The direction discriminability of these features are enhanced using the regularisation technique. Spatial regularisation based on electrode positions is also incorporated for comparison. The regularisation methods are applied on overlapped frequency bands and the results are compared. The classifications of extracted features are done using 5-fold cross-validation and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The study on 15 healthy subjects shows that filter bank-based spatially regularized CSP method (FBSRCSP) offers the highest average classification accuracy of 90% for decoding bidirectional motor imagery of hand movement. This is a substantial improvement in classification accuracy by 26.3% compared to the best method reported in literature on the same dataset.	[Rithwik, P.; Benzy, V.

Nowadays, there is a rising curiosity in interpreting and analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics with ConvNets. Our study focused on ConvNets of different structures, the efficiency of multiple machine learning algorithms with optimization on ConvNets, constructing for predicting imagined left and right movements on a subject-independent basis through raw EEG data. We adapted novel lower-upper triangularization based extreme learning machines (LuELM) to the ConvNet architecture. Results showed that recently advanced methods in machine learning field, i.e. adaptive moments and batch normalization together with dropout strategy, improved ConvNets predicting ability, outperforming that of conventional fully-connected neural networks with widely-used spectral features. The proposed prediction model achieved improvements in classification performances with the rates of 90.33%, 91.00%, and 89.67% for accuracy, recall, and specificity, respectively.

EEG waveforms are recorded, analysed and categorized across directives concerning a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Deteriorated signal to noise ratio and non-stationarities stand as a paramount obstacle in steady decoding of EEG. Appearance of non-stationarities across EEG patterns notably upset the feature waveforms thus worsening the functioning of detection block and as a whole the Brain Computer Interface. Stationary Subspace schemes bring to light subspaces within which data distribution persists stably over time. Current work focuses on the development of a novel spatial transform based feature extraction scheme to address nonstationarity in EEG signals recorded against a drowsiness detection problem (a machine learning regression scenario). The presented approach: F-DIV-IT-JAD-WS derived features distinctly surpassed DivOVR-FuzzyCSP-WS based standard features across RMSE and CC performance criteria pair. We construe that the propounded feature derivation approach based on F-DIV-IT-JAD-WS will usher a significant attention in researchers who are developing algorithms for signal processing, specifically, for BCI regression scenarios.

In this study, the design and implementation of the BCI control and monitoring system for smart home automation using wavelet features, which is based upon a dual-channel analogue EEG signal acquisition module is reported. The designed analogue EEG module performs EEG signal acquisition, signal amplification and filtering. Although the EEG data set contains thousands of samples and more than 15 different classes, we limit our study on 226 samples grouped into seven classes with 8-second time duration per sample. With careful settings of deep-learning classifier model parameters, the training and testing were successful with high accuracy results. The designed BCI system has several advantages including a large bandwidth of 400 Hz, low number of EEG electrodes, easy setup, simple user interface, pre-processing and digital filtering, fast machine learning, multi-class identification, monitoring and control models, high classification accuracy and low cost. This research work provided several contributions including the creation of recent and original EEG data set using well-labelled recordings at an adequate sampling rate of 2 kHz. The EEG signal acquisition module with 400-Hz bandwidth provides precise and rich EEG signal information needed for feature extraction. Our results are reproducible and have been tested and deployed on Raspberry pi 4 with Python. The designed wavelet-based BCI system consists of analogue EEG signal acquisition and machine-learning modules, which consist of deep-learning Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as well as other classifier models for comparison including convolutional neural networks (CNN). The deep learning and LDA classifiers models produced the best performance with average accuracy of 95.6% and 96% for both training and testing data sets.

However, the decoding of premovements from EEG signals remains a challenge for noninvasive BCI. This work aims to decode human intention (movement or rest) before movement onset from EEG signals. We propose to decode premovement patterns from movement-related cortical potential activities with task-related component analysis and canonical correlation patterns (TRCA+CCPs). Specifically, we first optimize the MRCP data with the spatial filter TRCA. CCPs are then extracted from the optimized signals. The extracted CCPs are classified with the linear discriminated analysis classifier. We applied the classification in a sliding window, which changes from readiness potential (RP section) to movement-monitoring potential (MMP section). The classification result on event-related desynchronization (ERD) indicates that the motor cortex becomes active as the limbs move. When applying classification between elbow flexion and rest, the proposed TRCA+CCP method achieves an accuracy of 0.9001 +/- 0.0997 in the RP section. The previous methods, discriminative canonical pattern matching + common spatial pattern (DCPM+CSP) and the optimized DCPM+CSP method, exhibit accuracy values of 0.7827 +/- 0.1276 and 0.8141 +/- 0.1295 for the RP section, respectively. Compared with these methods, the proposed TRCA+CCP method achieves higher average accuracy in the RP section. The proposed TRCA+CCP method can decode the patterns in the RP section efficiently, which indicates that the premovement patterns in EEG signals can be decoded before execution of the movement. The system is expected to assist movement detection in ERD analysis.

In previous works, several machine learning-based strategies were introduced to investigate and interpret EEG signals for the purpose of their accurate classification. However, non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of EEG signals make it complicated to get complete information about these dynamic biomedical signals. In order to address this issue, this paper focuses on extracting the most discriminating and distinguishing features of seizure EEG recordings to develop an approach that employs both fuzzy-based and traditional machine learning algorithms for epileptic seizure detection. The proposed framework classifies unknown EEG signal segments into ictal and interictal classes. The model is validated using empirical evaluation on two benchmark datasets, namely the Bonn and Children's Hospital of Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) datasets. The obtained results show that in both cases, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Fuzzy Rough Nearest Neighbor (FRNN) give the highest classification accuracy scores, with improved sensitivity and specificity percentages.

However, conventional EEG report generation processes are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an automatic, objective, and comprehensive pipeline for brain age estimation and EEG report conclusion prediction is urgently needed to assist clinician's decision-making. Methods: We recruited patients who underwent EEG monitoring from the NICU at Children's Hospital of Fudan University from Jan. 2016 to Mar. 2018. A total of 1,851 subjects were enrolled, including the patient's conceptional age (CA) and the clinical EEG report conclusion (normal, slightly abnormal, moderately abnormal, or severely abnormal). A total of 1,591 subjects were used to generate predictive models and 260 were used as the validation dataset. We developed Auto-Neo-EEG (an automatic prediction system to assist clinical neonatal EEG report generation), including signal feature extraction, supervised machine learning realized by gradient boosted models, to estimate brain age and predict EEG report conclusion. Results: The predicted results from the validation dataset were compared with the clinical observations to assess the performance. In the independent validation dataset, the model could achieve accordance 0.904 on estimating brain age for neonates with normal clinical EEG report conclusion, and differences between the predicted and observed brain age were strongly related with EEG report conclusion abnormality. Further, as for the EEG report conclusion prediction, the model could achieve area under the curve (AUC) of 0.984 for severely abnormal situations, and 0.857 for moderately abnormal ones. Conclusions: The Auto-Neo-EEG has the high accuracy of estimating brain age and EEG report conclusion, which can potentially greatly accelerate the EEG report generation processes assist in clinical decision making.

These algorithms find patterns in brain waves to distinguish between one class and another to turn them into control commands. To discuss the efficiency of classification algorithms in BCI for the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with motor images (MI), in this study twelve machine learning (ML) classifiers are applied and analyzed. The algorithms used are: 1) Convolutional network-Long short term memory (CNN-LSTM), 2) Convolutional network-gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU), 3) Convolutional-bidirectional long short term memory (CNN-BiLSTM), 4) convolutional-bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU), 5) Random Forest, 6) Decision tree (DT), 7) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), 8) Gaussian Naive Bayes, 9) Support Vector Machine (SVM), 10) Logistic Regression, 11) AdaBoost, 12) K-nearest neighbor (KNN). As classification tests, four mental tasks were registered, which are, the imagination of the movement of the left foot, the imagination of the movement of the left hand, state of relaxation, and mathematical activity, these mental tasks were obtained by a portable electroencephalogram (EEG) device. In the tests carried out it was found that the highest rate was 97% and the low rate was 22%.

The ability to analyze the BBB opening (OBBB) is crucial for the treatment of many brain diseases, but it is very difficult to noninvasively monitor OBBB. In this paper we analyze the EEG series of healthy rats in free behaviour and after music-induced OBBB. The research is performed using two completely different methods based on wavelet analysis and machine learning approach. The wavelet-approach demonstrates quantitative changes in the oscillatory structure in EEG signals after music listening, namely, a decrease in the number of patterns to the frequency band Delta f [1; 2.5] Hz. Using methods of machine learning we analyze the number of fragments of EEG realizations recognized as OBBB. After the music impact the number of recognized OBBB is increased in about 50%. Both methods enable us to recognize OBBB and are in a good agreement with each other. The comparative analysis was carried out using F-measures and ROC-curves.

This is therefore during the learning of a BCI for a subject, there is no clear protocol to use the captured knowledge of other trained BCIs. To overcome this, we have proposed a new parallel deep neural structure containing long short-term memory and multi-layer perception. Furthermore, a subject-to-subject transfer learning is exploited to improve both performance and learning speed. First, the proposed combinatorial classifier is trained over different subjects, then for each new case, a copy of this learned network is adopted to be fine-tuned by the EEG features of the new subject. The proposed method is assessed on an EEG dataset of motor imagery movements and compared to the support vector machines. The proposed method provides superior classification results and significantly speed up the learning process of the deep network.

Motor imagery (MI) classification based on Electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis has received a lot of attention for the purpose of movement intent recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction method which leads to promising MI classification performance. We split the individual EEG channels' time series into temporal blocks and compute connectivity matrices for each block using adaptive sparse representation (ASR). The connectivity matrices indicate the correlation among different channels' temporal blocks. They construct the dynamic connectivity patterns which are 3D tensors. Then, kernel PCA or non-linear convolutional autoencoders are applied to these tensors to learn discriminatory representations. This way, we incorporate the joint spatial-temporal structure of the EEG signals in the acquired features. We use a Gradient boosting model for classification. It is shown that the proposed feature extraction approach can lead to promising EEG MI classification performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Machines learn neuromarketing: Improving preference prediction from self-reports using multiple EEG measures and machine learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING			English	Article						Neuromarketing; Electroencephalography (EEG); Consumer&nbsp; neuroscience; Preference&nbsp; prediction; Machine learning; Forecasting	PERMUTATION TESTS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM EEG; BRAIN RESPONSES; CHOICE; CLASSIFICATION; NEUROSCIENCE; SIGNALS; BIAS; TOPOGRAPHY; ASYMMETRY	A basic aim of marketing research is to predict consumers' preferences and the success of marketing campaigns at the population-level. However, traditional marketing tools have various limitations, calling for novel measures to improve predictive power. In this study, we use multiple types of measures extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve preference prediction based on self-reports alone. Subjects watched video commercials of six food products as we recorded their EEG activity, after which they responded to a questionnaire that served as a self-report benchmark measure. Thereafter, subjects made binary choices over the food products. We attempted to predict within-sample and population level preferences, based on subjects' questionnaire responses and EEG measures extracted during the commercial viewings. We reached 68.5% accuracy in predicting between subjects' most and least preferred products, improving accuracy by 4.07 percentage points compared to prediction based on self-reports alone. Additionally, EEG measures improved within-sample prediction of all six products by 20%, resulting in only a 1.91 root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to 2.39 RMSE with questionnaire-based prediction alone. Moreover, at the population level, assessed using YouTube metrics and an online questionnaire, EEG measures increased prediction by 12.7% and 12.6% respectively, compared to only a questionnaire based prediction. We found that the most predictive EEG measures were frontal powers in the alpha band, hemispheric asymmetry in the beta band, and inter-subject correlation in delta and alpha bands. In summary, our novel approach, employing multiple types of EEG measures and ML models, offers marketing practitioners and researchers a valuable tool for predicting individual preferences and commercials' success in the real world.

The purpose of this report is to support work relating to the project 'The development of a brain controlled interface for trans-radial amputees'. This work is based on the idea that an EEG-based control scheme for prosthetics is credible in the current technological climate. The presented experiments investigate the efficiency and usability of the control scheme by testing response times and grasp accuracy. Response times are determined by user training and control method. The grasp accuracy relies on the effectiveness of the support vector machine used in the control scheme. The outcome of the research has the potential to provide amputees with an intuitive method of controlling a prosthetic device.

Classification of visuomotor tasks based on electroencephalographic data depends on age-related differences in brain activity patterns	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Dynamic mode decomposition; Fine motor control; Machine learning; Decoding; Dedifferentiation; Aging	COMPUTER INTERFACE; EEG; MEG; NETWORKS	Classification of physiological data provides a data driven approach to study central aspects of motor control, which changes with age. To implement such results in real-life applications for elderly it is important to identify age-specific characteristics of movement classification. We compared task-classification based on EEG derived activity patterns related to brain network characteristics between older and younger adults performing force tracking with two task characteristics (sinusoidal; constant) with the right or left hand. We extracted brain network patterns with dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and classified the tasks on an individual level using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Next, we compared the models' performance between the groups. Studying brain activity patterns, we identified signatures of altered motor network function reflecting dedifferentiated and compensational brain activation in older adults. We found that the classification performance of the body side was lower in older adults. However, classification performance with respect to task characteristics was better in older adults. This may indicate a higher susceptibility of brain network mechanisms to task difficulty in elderly. Signatures of dedifferentiation and compensation refer to an age-related reorganization of functional brain networks, which suggests that classification of visuomotor tracking tasks is influenced by age-specific characteristics of brain activity patterns. In addition to insights into central aspects of fine motor control, the results presented here are relevant in application-oriented areas such as brain computer interfaces. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, keystroke dynamics-based systems achieve very high accuracy but have low anti-spoofing capability. To address these issues, a novel multimodal biometric system combining EEG and keystroke dynamics is proposed in this paper. A dataset was created by acquiring both keystroke dynamics and EEG signals simultaneously from 10 users. Each user participated in 500 trials at 10 different sessions (days) to replicate real-life signal variability. A machine learning classification pipeline is developed using multi-domain feature extraction (time, frequency, time-frequency), feature selection (Gini impurity), classifier design, and score level fusion. Different classifiers were trained, validated, and tested for two different classification experiments - personalized and generalized. For identification and authentication, 99.9% and 99.6% accuracies are achieved, respectively for the Random Forest classifier in 5 fold cross-validation. These results outperform the individual modalities with a significant margin (similar to 5%). We also developed a binary template matching-based algorithm, which gives 93.64% accuracy 6X faster. The proposed method can be considered secure and reliable for any kind of biometric identification and authentication.

We investigated potential quantitative electroencephalography biomarkers in 57 patients with post-concussive syndrome and chronic pain following motor vehicle collision, and 54 healthy nearly age- and sex-matched controls. (2) Methods: Electroencephalography processing was completed in MATLAB, statistical modeling in SPSS, and machine learning modeling in Rapid Miner. Group differences were calculated using current-source density estimation, yielding whole-brain topographical distributions of absolute power, relative power and phase-locking functional connectivity. Groups were compared using independent sample Mann-Whitney U tests. Effect sizes and Pearson correlations were also computed. Machine learning analysis leveraged a post hoc supervised learning support vector non-probabilistic binary linear kernel classification to generate predictive models from the derived EEG signatures. (3) Results: Patients displayed significantly elevated and slowed power compared to controls: delta (p = 0.000000, r = 0.6) and theta power (p < 0.0001, r = 0.4), and relative delta power (p < 0.00001) and decreased relative alpha power (p < 0.001). Absolute delta and theta power together yielded the strongest machine learning classification accuracy (87.6%). Changes in absolute power were moderately correlated with duration and persistence of symptoms in the slow wave frequency spectrum (<15 Hz). (4) Conclusions: Distributed increases in slow wave oscillatory power are concurrent with post-concussive syndrome and chronic pain.

Therefore, it is necessary to build automated classification framework to decode different brain signals. Methods: In the present study, two-step filtering approach is utilize to achieve resilience towards cognitive and external noises. Then, empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and four data reduction techniques; principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and neighborhood component analysis (NCA) are first time integrated together to explore dynamic nature and pattern mining of motor imagery (MI) EEG signals. Specifically, EWT helped to explore the hidden patterns of MI tasks by decomposing EEG data into different modes where every mode was consider as a feature vector in this study and each data reduction technique have been applied to all these modes to reduce the dimension of huge feature matrix. Moreover, an automated correlation-based components/coefficients selection criteria and parameter tuning were implemented for PCA, ICA, LDA, and NCA respectively. For the comparison purposes, all the experiments were performed on two publicly available datasets (BCI competition III dataset IVa and IVb). The performance of the experiments was verified by decoding three different channel combination strategies along with several neural networks. The regularization parameter tuning of NCA guaranteed to improve classification performance with significant features for each subject. Results: The experimental results revealed that NCA provides an average sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score and kappa-coefficient of 100% for subject dependent case whereas 93%, 93%, 92.9%, 93%, 96.4% and 90% for subject independent case respectively. All the results were obtained with artificial neural networks, cascade-forward neural networks and multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) for subject dependent case while with MLP for subject independent case by utilizing 7 channels out of total 118. Such an increase in results can alleviate users to explain more clearly their MI activities. For instance, physically impaired person will be able to manage their wheelchair quite effectively, and rehabilitated persons may be able to improve their activities.

Although advanced algorithms exist to suppress background noise in these situations, a hearing device also needs information about which speaker a user actually aims to attend to. The voice of the correct (attended) speaker can then be enhanced through this information, and all other speakers can be treated as background noise. Recent neuroscientific advances have shown that it is possible to determine the focus of auditory attention through noninvasive neurorecording techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Based on these insights, a multitude of auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms has been proposed, which could, combined with appropriate speaker separation algorithms and miniaturized EEG sensors, lead to so-called neurosteered hearing devices. In this article, we provide a broad review and a statistically grounded comparative study of EEG-based AAD algorithms and address the main signal processing challenges in this field.

Along with this progress have come claims that appear to us to be a bit premature. We anticipate that many people will benefit from seizure prediction. We also doubt that all will benefit. Although machine learning is a useful tool for aiding discovery, we believe that the greatest progress will come from deeper understanding of seizures, epilepsy, and the EEG features that enable seizure prediction. In this essay, we lay out reasons for optimism and skepticism.

In traditional MI EEG machine learning algorithms, feature extraction and classification often have different objective functions, thus resulting in information loss. To solve this problem, a novel spatial-frequency-temporal (SFT) 3D CNN model is proposed. Specifically, the energies of EEG signals located in multiple local SFT ranges are extracted to obtain a novel 3D MI EEG feature representation, and a novel 3D CNN model is designed to simultaneously learn the complex MI EEG features in the entire SFT domains and carry out classification. An extensive experimental study is implemented on two public EEG datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. For BCI Competition III Dataset IVa, the average accuracy rate of five subjects obtained by the proposed method reaches 86.6% and yields 4.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art filter band common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method. For BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, by achieving an average accuracy rate of 91.85%, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art dictionary pair learning (DPL) method by 4.44%.

J	Agarwal, S; Zubair, M				Agarwal, Shrey; Zubair, Muhammad			Classification of Alcoholic and Non-Alcoholic EEG Signals Based on Sliding-SSA and Independent Component Analysis	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Alcoholism; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Support vector machines; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Alcoholism; EEG signals; sliding singular spectrum analysis; independent component analysis; machine learning models	DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES	Alcoholism is a widely affected disorder that leads to critical brain deficiencies such as emotional and behavioural impairments. One of the prominent sources to detect alcoholism is by analysing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Previously, most of the works have focused on detecting alcoholism using various machine and deep learning algorithms. This paper has used a novel algorithm named Sliding Singular Spectrum Analysis (S-SSA) to decompose and de-noise the EEG signals. We have considered independent component analysis (ICA) to select the prominent alcoholic and non-alcoholic components from the preprocessed EEG data. Later, these components were used to train and test various machine learning models like SVM, KNN, ANN, GBoost, AdaBoost and XGBoost to classify alcoholic and non-alcoholic EEG signals. The sliding SSA-ICA algorithm helps in reducing the computational time and complexity of the machine learning models. To validate the performance of the ICA algorithm, we have compared the computational time and accuracy of ICA with its counterpart, like principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The proposed algorithm is tested on a publicly available UCI alcoholic EEG dataset. To verify the performance of machine learning models, we have calculated various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. Our work reported the highest accuracy of 98.97% with the XGBoost classifier. The validation of the proposed method is done by comparing the classification metrics with the latest state-of-the-art works.

Recent advancements in technology and machine learning algorithms have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG)-based BCI applications. EEG-based intelligent BCI systems can facilitate continuous monitoring of fluctuations in human cognitive states under monotonous tasks, which is both beneficial for people in need of healthcare support and general researchers in different domain areas. In this review, we survey the recent literature on EEG signal sensing technologies and computational intelligence approaches in BCI applications, compensating for the gaps in the systematic summary of the past five years. Specifically, we first review the current status of BCI and signal sensing technologies for collecting reliable EEG signals. Then, we demonstrate state-of-the-art computational intelligence techniques, including fuzzy models and transfer learning in machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to detect, monitor, and maintain human cognitive states and task performance in prevalent applications. Finally, we present a couple of innovative BCI-inspired healthcare applications and discuss future research directions in EEG-based BCI research.

The objective of the study is to identify phase coupling patterns that are shared across subjects via a machine learning approach that utilises source space magnetoencephalography (MEG) phase coupling data from a working memory (WM) task. Indeed, phase coupling of neural oscillations is putatively a key factor for communication between distant brain areas and is therefore crucial in performing cognitive tasks, including WM. Previous studies investigating phase coupling during cognitive tasks have often focused on a few a priori selected brain areas or a specific frequency band, and the need for data-driven approaches has been recognised. Machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools for the analysis of neuroimaging data since they catch fine-grained differences in the multivariate signal distribution. Here, we expect that these techniques applied to MEG phase couplings can reveal WM-related processes that are shared across individuals. Approach. We analysed WM data collected as part of the Human Connectome Project. The MEG data were collected while subjects (n = 83) performed N-back WM tasks in two different conditions, namely 2-back (WM condition) and 0-back (control condition). We estimated phase coupling patterns (multivariate phase slope index) for both conditions and for theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. The obtained phase coupling data were then used to train a linear support vector machine in order to classify which task condition the subject was performing with an across-subject cross-validation approach. The classification was performed separately based on the data from individual frequency bands and with all bands combined (multiband). Finally, we evaluated the relative importance of the different features (phase couplings) for classification by the means of feature selection probability. Main results. The WM condition and control condition were successfully classified based on the phase coupling patterns in the theta (62% accuracy) and alpha bands (60% accuracy) separately. Importantly, the multiband classification showed that phase coupling patterns not only in the theta and alpha but also in the gamma bands are related to WM processing, as testified by improvement in classification performance (71%). Significance. Our study successfully decoded WM tasks using MEG source space functional connectivity. Our approach, combining across-subject classification and a multidimensional metric recently developed by our group, is able to detect patterns of connectivity that are shared across individuals. In other words, the results are generalisable to new individuals and allow meaningful interpretation of task-relevant phase coupling patterns.

Meditation is linked to higher-order cognitive processes, which may function as a scaffold for cognitive control. In line with these developments, we analyze oscillatory brain activities of expert and non-expert meditators from the Himalayan Yoga tradition. We exploit four dimensions (Temporal, Spectral, Spatial and Pattern) of EEG data and present an analysis pipeline employing machine learning techniques. We discuss the significance of different frequency bands in relation with distinct primary 5 scalp brain regions. Functional connectivity networks (PLV) are utilized to generate features for classification between expert and non-expert meditators. We find (a) higher frequency / 3 and -y oscillations generate maximum discrimination over the parietal region whereas lower frequency 0 and a oscillations dominant over the frontal region; (b) maximum accuracy of over 90% utilizing features from all regions; (c) Quadratic Discriminant Analysis surpasses other classifiers by learning distribution for classification. Overall, this paper contributes a pipeline to analyze EEG data utilizing various properties and suggests potential neural markers for an expert meditative state. We discuss the implications of our research for the advancement of personalized headset design that rely on feedback on depth of meditation by learning from expert meditators.

For this purpose, we classified the breathing patterns according to EEG signals using a machine learning technique and proposed a method to reduce the side effects of mouth breathing on brain function. Twenty subjects participated in this study, and each subject performed three different breathings: nose and mouth breathing and mouth breathing with O-2 supply during a working memory task. The results showed that nose breathing guarantees normal O-2 supply to the brain, but mouth breathing interrupts the O-2 supply to the brain. Therefore, this comparative study of EEG signals using machine learning showed that one of the most important elements distinguishing the effects of mouth and nose breathing on brain function was the difference in O-2 supply. These findings have important implications for the workplace environment, suggesting that special care is required for employees who work long hours in confined spaces such as public transport, and that a sufficient O-2 supply is needed in the workplace for working efficiency.

However, these human language processing signals can also be beneficial in machine learning-based natural language processing tasks. Using EEG brain activity for this purpose is largely unexplored as of yet. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of systematically analyzing the potential of EEG brain activity data for improving natural language processing tasks, with a special focus on which features of the signal are most beneficial. We present a multi-modal machine learning architecture that learns jointly from textual input as well as from EEG features. We find that filtering the EEG signals into frequency bands is more beneficial than using the broadband signal. Moreover, for a range of word embedding types, EEG data improves binary and ternary sentiment classification and outperforms multiple baselines. For more complex tasks such as relation detection, only the contextualized BERT embeddings outperform the baselines in our experiments, which raises the need for further research. Finally, EEG data shows to be particularly promising when limited training data is available.

Many new BCI paradigms and algorithms have been developed in recent years. Therefore, it is necessary to review new progress in BCIs. This paper summarizes progress for EEG-based BCIs from the perspective of encoding paradigms and decoding algorithms, which are two key elements of BCI systems. Encoding paradigms are grouped by their underlying neural meachanisms, namely sensory- and motor-related, vision-related, cognition-related and hybrid paradigms. Decoding algorithms are reviewed in four categories, namely decomposition algorithms, Riemannian geometry, deep learning and transfer learning.

Recent deep learning methods, which fail to fully explore both deep-temporal characterizations in EEGs itself and multi-spectral information in different rhythms, generally ignore the temporal or spectral dependencies in MI-EEG. Also, the lack of effective feature fusion probably leads to redundant or irrelative information and thus fails to achieve the most discriminative features, resulting in the limited MI-EEG decoding performance. To address these issues, in this paper, a MI-EEG decoding framework is proposed, which uses a novel temporal-spectral-based squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion network (TS-SEFFNet). First, the deep-temporal convolution block (DT-Conv block) implements convolutions in a cascade architecture, which extracts high-dimension temporal representations from raw EEG signals. Second, the multi-spectral convolution block (MS-Conv block) is then conducted in parallel using multi-level wavelet convolutions to capture discriminative spectral features from corresponding clinical subbands. Finally, the proposed squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion block (SE-Feature-Fusion block) maps the deep-temporal and multi-spectral features into comprehensive fused feature maps, which highlights channel-wise feature responses by constructing interdependencies among different domain features. Competitive experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that our method is able to achieve promising decoding performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing studies on hand movement direction decoding concentrate on the decoding of a single-hand movement direction from EEG signals given the opposite hand is maintained still. In practice, the cooperative movement of both hands is common. In this paper, we investigated the neural signatures and decoding of single-hand and both-hand movement directions from EEG signals. The potentials of EEG signals and power sums in the low frequency band of EEG signals from 24 channels were used as decoding features. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used for decoding. Experimental results showed a significant difference in the negative offset maximums of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) at electrode Cz between single-hand and both-hand movements. The recognition accuracies for six-class classification, including two single-hand and four both-hand movement directions, reached 70.29%+/- 10.85% by using EEG potentials as features with the SVM classifier. These findings showed the feasibility of decoding single-hand and both-hand movement directions. This work can lay a foundation for the future development of an active human-machine collaboration system based on EEG signals and open a new research direction in the field of decoding hand movement parameters from EEG signals.

Decoding visual colour from scalp electroencephalography measurements	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Color; EEG; Decoding; Supervised learning; Features; Vision	WORKING-MEMORY; INFORMATION; ATTENTION; EEG; RESPONSES; REPRESENTATIONS; MICROSACCADES; OSCILLATIONS; MEG	Recent advances have made it possible to decode various aspects of visually presented stimuli from patterns of scalp EEG measurements. As of recently, such multivariate methods have been commonly used to decode visual-spatial features such as location, orientation, or spatial frequency. In the current study, we show that it is also possible to track visual colour processing by using Linear Discriminant Analysis on patterns of EEG activity. Building on other recent demonstrations, we show that colour decoding: (1) reflects sensory qualities (as opposed to, for example, verbal labelling) with a prominent contribution from posterior electrodes contralateral to the stimulus, (2) conforms to a parametric coding space, (3) is possible in multi-item displays, and (4) is comparable in magnitude to the decoding of visual stimulus orientation. Through subsampling our data, we also provide an estimate of the approximate number of trials and participants required for robust decoding. Finally, we show that while colour decoding can be sensitive to subtle differences in luminance, our colour decoding results are primarily driven by measured colour differences between stimuli. Colour decoding opens a relevant new dimension in which to track visual processing using scalp EEG measurements, while bypassing potential confounds associated with decoding approaches that focus on spatial features.

The EEG signals inherently have nondeterministic patterns. Hence, we have used a chaotic feature generation function to classify normal and abnormal EEG signals in this work. Method: This research presents a new generation abnormal EEG detection model using a chaotic one-dimensional local binary pattern (CLBP) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) techniques. The Temple University Hospital (TUH) EEG dataset is used to develop and evaluate our chaotic feature generation model. In this work, the WPD is performed on EEG signals, and then CLBP is applied on the decomposed signals to extract the features. The iterative minimum redundancy maximum relevancy (ImRMR) is applied to select the clinically significant features. Finally, these features are classified into normal and abnormal EEG classes using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results: Our developed model yielded the detection accuracies of 93.84% to 98.19% for 24 channels using SVM classifier with ten-fold cross-validation strategy. Conclusion: We have obtained the highest classification performance of 98.19% for the PZ channel that is the highest performance so far using this database. Our developed model is ready to be tested with more EEG data.	[Tuncer, Turker; Dogan, Sengul] Firat Univ, Dept Digital Forens Engn, Coll Technol, Elazig, Turkey; [Acharya, U.

They are identified through visual inspection of electroencephalography (EEG) reports and treated by neurophysiologic experts. To support clinical seizure detection, several feature-based automatic neonatal seizure detection algorithms have been proposed. However, as they were unsuitable for clinical application due to their low accuracy, we developed a new seizure detection algorithm using machine learning for single-channel EEG to overcome these limitations. Methods The dataset applied in our algorithm contains EEG recordings from human neonates. A 19-channel EEG system recorded the brain waves of 79 term neonates admitted to the NICU at the Helsinki University Hospital. From these datasets, we selected six patients with conformational seizure annotations for the pilot study and allocated four and two patients for our training and testing datasets, respectively. The presence of seizures in the EEGs was annotated independently by three experts through visual interpretation. We divided the data into epochs of 5 s each and further defined a seizure block to label the annotations from each expert recorded every second. Subsequently, to create a balanced dataset, any data point with a non-seizure label was moved to the training and test dataset. Result The developed principal component feature-extracted machine learning algorithm used 62.5% of the relative time (only 5 s for decision) of the baseline, reaching an area under the ROC curve score of 0.91. The effect of diversified parameters was meticulously examined, and 100 principal components were extracted to optimize the model performance. Conclusion Our machine learning-based seizure detection algorithm exhibited the potential for clinical application in NICUs, general wards, and at home and proved its convenience by requiring only a single channel for implementation.

Many recent studies on electroencephalography (EEG) have been focusing on modeling and estimating brain connectivity due to increasing evidence that it can help better understand various brain neurological conditions. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive updated review on studies of EEG-based brain connectivity, particularly on visualization options and associated machine learning applications, aiming to translate those techniques into useful clinical tools. This article reviews EEG-based functional and effective connectivity studies undertaken over the last few years, in terms of estimation, visualization, and applications associated with machine learning classifiers. Methods are explored and discussed from various dimensions, such as either linear or nonlinear, parametric or nonparametric, time-based, and frequency-based or time-frequency-based. Then it is followed by a novel review of brain connectivity visualization methods, grouped by Heat Map, data statistics, and Head Map, aiming to explore the variation of connectivity across different brain regions. Finally, the current challenges of related research and a roadmap for future related research are presented.

Recently, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been extensively studied to facilitate more accurate detection and prediction of the user's intentions. Specifically, various deep learning approaches have been applied to the BCIs for decoding the user's intent from motor-imagery electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, their ability to capture the important features of an EEG signal remains limited, resulting in the deterioration of performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer temporal pyramid pooling approach to improve the performance of motor imagery-based BCIs. The proposed scheme introduces the application of multilayer multiscale pooling and fusion methods to capture various features of an EEG signal, which can be easily integrated into modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The experimental results based on the BCI competition IV dataset indicate that the CNN architectures with the proposed multilayer pyramid pooling method enhance classification performance compared to the original networks.

However, the accuracy of emotion recognition is not satisfying. Considering the advantage of information supplement based on deep learning of multi-modal signals related to emotion, this study proposed a novel emotion recognition architecture to fuse emotional features from brain electroencephalography (EEG) signal and the corresponding audio signal in emotion recognition on DEAP dataset. We used convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract EEG features and bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks to extract audio features. After that, we combine the multi-modal features into a deep learning architecture to recognize arousal and valence levels. Results showed an improved accuracy compared with previous studies that merely used the EEG signals in both arousal level and valence level, which suggests the effectiveness of our proposed multi-modal fused emotion recognition model. In future work, multi-modal data from nature interaction scenes will be collected and inputted into this architecture to further validate the effectiveness of the method.

It is an easy and cost effective tool to characterize motor imager (MI) task used in brain computer interface (BCI) implementation. The MI task is represented by short time trial of multichannel EEG. In this paper, the raw EEG trial is regenerated using narrowband signals obtained from individual channel. Each channel of EEG trial is decomposed into a set of subband signals using multivariate discrete wavelet transform. The selected subbands are organized in two different ways namely vertical arrangement of subbands (VaS) and horizontal arrangement of subbands (HaS) to regenerate the trials. The features are extracted from each of the arrangements using common spatial pattern (CSP). An optimum number of features are used to classify the motor imagery tasks represented by EEG trials. The effectiveness of two classifiers- linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) are studied. The performances of the proposed methods are evaluated using publicly available benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that it performs better than the recently developed algorithms.

The core idea is to learn plausible computational and biological representations by correlating human neural activity and natural images. Thus, we first propose a model, EEG-ChannelNet, to learn a brain manifold for EEG classification. After verifying that visual information can be extracted from EEG data, we introduce a multimodal approach that uses deep image and EEG encoders, trained in a siamese configuration, for learning a joint manifold that maximizes a compatibility measure between visual features and brain representations. We then carry out image classification and saliency detection on the learned manifold. Performance analyses show that our approach satisfactorily decodes visual information from neural signals. This, in turn, can be used to effectively supervise the training of deep learning models, as demonstrated by the high performance of image classification and saliency detection on out-of-training classes. The obtained results show that the learned brain-visual features lead to improved performance and simultaneously bring deep models more in line with cognitive neuroscience work related to visual perception and attention.

Even more, decoding the intention to perform movements from the motor preparation phase is a still largely unexplored topic, as most of the efforts have been focused so far on motor imagery. The present paper deals with BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG), the best candidate for future systems meant for widespread use, with the goal of decoding the preparation of hand open/close movement from the EEG recordings of the subject. To this end, a dataset of EEG signals recorded in the 1s frame preceding the onset of movement are extracted from a publicly available database. Epochs are properly pre-filtered between 0.5 and 32 Hz and labelled as pre-hand closing (HC), pre-hand opening (HO) or resting (RE) epochs. A system for motion planning decoding, based on a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and named "Motion Planning Neural Network" MPnnet, is designed, trained and tested over the constructed dataset, achieving a mean HC-RE and HO-RE accuracy of 90.77 +/- 5.56% and of 92.48 +/- 4.3%, respectively. MPnnet matched the performance of more complex systems proposed in the past, allowing to skip the inverse problem solution step and showing to be able to self-learn relevant features directly from scalp EEG signals.

Early diagnosis has great importance to prevent the negative effects on the person. The aim of this study is to develop an objective method to differentiate MDD patients from healthy controls. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals taken from 16 MDD patients and 16 healthy subjects are analyzed according to the regions of the brain, and time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear features were extracted. The feature sets are classified using five different classification algorithms. As a result of the study, a classification accuracy of 89.5% was yielded using the Bagging classifier with 7 features calculated from the central EEG channels.

However, only a small amount of labeled epileptic data is available for training because labeling requires numerous neurologists. This paper proposes a one-step semi-supervised epilepsy detection system to reduce the labeling cost by fully utilizing the unlabeled data. The proposed neural network training strategy enables a more robust and accurate decision boundary by forcing the consistency of the double predictions on the same unlabeled data. The results show that the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves of our proposed model are 103% and 4.9% higher than the supervised methods on CHB-MIT and Kaggle datasets, respectively.

BCI devices leveraging electroencephalography (EEG) signals as a means of communication typically use manual feature engineering on the data to perform decoding. This approach is time intensive, requires substantial domain knowledge, and does not translate well, even to similar tasks. To combat this issue, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to perform decoding on EEG data collected from an auditory attention paradigm. Our CNN model not only bypasses the need for manual feature engineering, but additionally improves decoding accuracy (similar to 77%) and efficiency (similar to 11 bits/min) compared to a support vector machine (SVM) baseline. The results demonstrate the potential for the use of CNN in auditory BCI designs.

In contrast to traditional BCIs that require a subject-specific calibration process before being operated, a subject-independent BCI learns a subject-independent model and eliminates subject-specific calibration for new users. However, building subject-independent BCIs remains difficult because electroencephalography (EEG) is highly noisy and varies by subject. In this study, we propose an invariant pattern learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and big EEG data for subject-independent P300 BCIs. The CNN was trained using EEG data from a large number of subjects, allowing it to extract subject-independent features and make predictions for new users. We collected EEG data from 200 subjects in a P300-based spelling task using two different types of amplifiers. The offline analysis showed that almost all subjects obtained significant cross-subject and cross-amplifier effects, with an average accuracy of more than 80%. Furthermore, more than half of the subjects achieved accuracies above 85%. These results indicated that our method was effective for building a subject-independent P300 BCI, with which more than 50% of users could achieve high accuracies without subject-specific calibration.

Using the P300 component of event-related potential (ERP) [electroencephalography (EEG)], we have developed a concealed information test (CIT), which provides an easy and effective way to identify whether an individual carries some concealed information. The P300 component is elicited when an individual is provoked with stimuli related to his/her memories. Taking advantage of this P300 feature, several images of certain familiar and nonfamiliar faces are shown to the subjects during the experiment. Throughout the image presentation, EEG data of the subject are recorded. Signal preprocessing, processing, and classification algorithms are then implemented on the recorded EEG data. This article aims to classify the recorded EEG data for CIT. For extracting the spatial features from the recorded EEG data (of range 0.5-30 Hz), a common spatial pattern has been used. A fuzzy integrator system is developed using classifier performance measures as the antecedents. A novel defuzzification function called generalized mean of maxima (GMoM) has also been proposed to achieve a classification score or value. The experimental results demonstrate the outperformance of fuzzy-based CIT with significant classification accuracy.

The aim of this study is to characterize the functional brain network alterations in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). To this end, rsEEG signals were recorded before and after a cognitive task. Functional connectivity metrics were calculated using debiased weighted phase lag index (DWPLI). Topological features of the functional connectivity network were analyzed using both the classical graph approach and minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. Subsequently, the network and connectivity values together with Mini-Mental State Examination cognitive test were used as features to classify the participants. Results showed that: (1) across the pre-task condition, in the theta band, the aMCI group had a significantly lower global mean DWPLI than the control group; the functional connectivity patterns were different in the left hemisphere between two groups; the aMCI group showed significantly higher average clustering coefficient and the remarkably lower global efficiency than the control. (2) Analysis of graph measures under post-task resting state, unveiled that for the percentage change of post-task vs. pre-task in beta EEG, a significant increase in tree hierarchy was observed in aMCI group (2.41%) than in normal control (-3.89%); (3) Furthermore, the classification analysis of combined measures of functional connectivity, brain topology, and MMSE test showed improved accuracy compared to the single method, for which the connectivity patterns and graph metrics were used as separate inputs. The classification accuracy obtained for the case of post-task resting state was 87.2%, while the one achieved under pre-task resting state was found to be 77.7%. Therefore, the functional network alterations in aMCI patients were more prominent during the post-task resting state. This study suggests that the disintegration observed in MCI functional network during the resting states, preceding and following a task, might be possible biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in aMCI patients.

Rajendra			Novel automated PD detection system using aspirin pattern with EEG signals	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Aspirin pattern; Neighborhood component analysis; Maximum absolute pooling; PD detection; EEG signal Classification	CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Background and objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common diseases worldwide which reduces quality of life of patients and their family members. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals coupled with various advanced machine-learning algorithms have been widely used to detect PD automatically. In this paper, we propose a novel aspirin pattern to detect PD accurately using EEG signals. Method: In this research, the feature generation ability of a chemical graph is investigated. Therefore, this work presents a new graph-based aspirin model for automated PD detection using EEG signals. The proposed method consists of (i) multilevel feature generation phase involving new aspirin pattern, statistical moments, and maximum absolute pooling (MAP), (ii) selection of most discriminative features using neighborhood component analysis (NCA), and (iii) classification using k nearest neighbor (kNN) for automated detection of PD and (iv) iterative majority voting. Results: A public dataset has been used to develop the proposed model. Two cases are created, and these cases consisted of two classes. Leave one subject out (LOSO) validation have been used to calculate robust results. Our proposal achieved 93.57% and 95.48% classification accuracies for Case 1 and Case 2 respectively. Conclusion: Our developed automated PD model is accurate and equipped to be tested with more diverse EEG datasets.

Here we applied regularized linear discriminant analysis to human scalp EEG data and were able to distinguish a mental-rotation task versus a color-perception task with 87% decoding accuracy. Dorsal and ventral areas in lateral PFC provided the dominant features dissociating the two tasks. Our findings show that EEG can reliably decode two independent task states from PFC and emphasize the PFC dorsal/ventral functional specificity in processing the where rotation task versus the what color task.

Use of Mobile EEG in Decoding Hand Movement Speed and Position	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); movement decoding; movement speed and position	WIRELESS EEG; LOW-COST	With the majority of brain-computer interface (BCI) research currently restricted to the controlled settings in labs, there is a growing interest to study the feasibility of BCI applications in the real world. This interest is largely driven by the availability of ergonomic electroencephalography (EEG) recording devices. In this article, we investigate the feasibility of applying a commercial EEG device in motor decoding and propose a signal processing strategy to classify and reconstruct hand movement speed and position. An experiment is designed to simultaneously record EEG and hand position, while the user executes movement toward the left or right direction at two different speeds. A visual interface is designed to guide the user to perform the task under each condition. Data are recorded from 21 subjects. The classification of direction-dependent and -independent speeds is implemented using spatial and spectral features. An optimized movement parameter estimation strategy is proposed to reconstruct the instantaneous position and speed of the hand from EEG. Average performances of 73.36 (+/- 11.95)%, 69.46 (+/- 13.39)%, and68.98 (+/- 14.79)% are obtained for direction independent, right and left direction fast versus slow classification, respectively. The average correlation between recorded and reconstructed hand position and speed along the x-axis is in the range of [0.22, 0.57] and [0.26, 0.58], respectively. The reported results validate the use of commercial-gradeEEGand low-frequency components of EEG relevant to motor decoding for real-world motor kinematics BCI applications.

While non-invasive methodologies are safer, cheaper and vastly more accessible technologies, signals suffer from either poor resolution in the space domain (EEG) or the temporal domain (BOLD signal of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy, fNIRS). The non-invasive BCI decoding of bimanual force generation and the continuous force signal has not been realised before and so we introduce an isometric grip force tracking task to evaluate the decoding. We find that combining EEG and fNIRS using deep neural networks works better than linear models to decode continuous grip force modulations produced by the left and the right hand. Our multi-modal deep learning decoder achieves 55.2 FVAF[%] in force reconstruction and improves the decoding performance by at least 15% over each individual modality. Our results show a way to achieve continuous hand force decoding using cortical signals obtained with non-invasive mobile brain imaging has immediate impact for rehabilitation, restoration and consumer applications.

Recognition of epilepsy types is the basis to determine the treatment method and predict the prognosis in epilepsy patients. Childhood benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) or benign Rolandic epilepsy is the most common focal epilepsy in children, accounting for 15-20% of childhood epilepsies. These EEG patterns of individuals usually predict good treatment responses and prognosis. Until now, the interpretation of EEG still depends entirely on experienced neurologists, which may be a lengthy and tedious task. Method In this article, we proposed a novel machine learning model that efficiently distinguished Rolandic seizures from normal EEG signals. The proposed machine learning model processes the identification procedure in the following order (1) creating preliminary EEG features using signal empirical mode decomposition, (2) applying weighted overlook graph (WOG) to represent the decomposed EMD of IMF, and (3) classifying the results through a two Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2DCNN). The performance of our classification model is compared with other representative machine learning models. Results The model offered in this article gains an accuracy performance exceeding 97.6% in the Rolandic dataset, which is higher than other classification models. The effect of the model on the Bonn public dataset is also comparable to existing methods and even performs better in some subsets. Conclusion The purpose of this study is to introduce the most common childhood benign epilepsy type and propose a model that meets the real clinical needs to distinguish this Rolandic EEG pattern from normal signals accurately. Significance Future research will optimize the model to categorize other types of epilepsies beyond BECTS and finally implement them in the hospital system.

An EEG evoking paradigm by implementing margin energy constraint in complex coupling objects is used for inducing strong intention and providing high recognition accuracy. Motor intention decoding from task-dependent EEG was given by a generalized quadratic discriminant analysis, which is proposed based on discriminant analysis. The generalization method is flexible and adaptive to any given data. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic comparison relative to extracted features in different dimensions and to find the optimal feature dimension. Cross-validation is used to make the generalized quadratic discriminant analysis method adaptive individually for each volunteer. The discriminant performance of state recognition given by area under the receiver operating characteristics curve is ~ 0.96 from ten volunteers, this performance has been found to compare very favorably with some wellknown powerful classifiers. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method generalized quadratic discriminant analysis has excellent decoding performance in manipulating complex objects. Together, this work can provide a guarantee for improving the accuracy of intention recognition on data level with the high engagement demanding task, and may inspire better EEG acquisition contexts.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is considered a reliable standard for mental fatigue detection. The existing EEG fatigue detection methods mainly use traditional machine learning models to classify mental fatigue after manual feature extraction. However, manual feature extraction is difficult and complicated. The quality of feature extraction largely determines the quality of the model. In this article, we collected EEG signals from 30 medical staff. The wavelet threshold denoising method was then applied to the measured EEG signal data to denoise the original EEG data, and a method based on a convolution and long short-term memory (CNN + LSTM) neural network to determine the fatigue state of medical staff. The extensive experiment on the established dataset clearly proves the advancement of our proposed algorithm compared to other neural network-based methods. Compared with the existing DNN, CNN and LSTM, the proposed model can quickly learn the information before and after the time series, so as to obtain higher classification accuracy.

Rajendra			Automated major depressive disorder detection using melamine pattern with EEG signals	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Melamine pattern; Statistical feature generation; Major depression detection; NCA selector; EEG signal processing	MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS; FILTER-BANK; NONLINEAR FEATURES; DIAGNOSIS; DISCRIMINATION; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; DISEASE	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common modern ailments affected huge population throughout the world. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is widely used to screen the MDD. The manual diagnosis of MDD using EEG is time consuming, subjective and may cause human errors. Therefore, nowadays various automated systems have been developed to diagnose MDD accurately and rapidly. In this work, we have proposed a novel automated MDD detection system using EEG signals. Our proposed model has three steps: (i) Melamine pattern and discrete wavelet transform (DWT)- based multileveled feature generation, (ii) selection of most relevant features using neighborhood component analysis (NCA) and (iii) classification using support vector machine (SVM) and k nearest neighbor (kNN) classifiers. The novelty of this work is the application of melamine pattern. The molecular structure of melamine (also named chemistry spider- ChemSpider) is used to generate 1536 features. Also, various statistical features are extracted from DWT coefficients. The NCA is used to select the most relevant features and these selected features are classified using SVM and kNN classifiers. The presented model attained greater than 95% accuracies using all channels with quadratic SVM classifier. Our results obtained highest classification accuracy of 99.11% and 99.05% using Weighted kNN and Quadratic SVM respectively using A2A1 EEG channel. We have developed the automated depression model using a big dataset and yielded high classification accuracies. These results indicate that our presented model can be used in mental health clinics to confirm the manual diagnosis of psychiatrists.

Supervised learning paradigms are often limited by the amount of labeled data that is available. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in clinically-relevant data, such as electroencephalography (EEG), where labeling can be costly in terms of specialized expertise and human processing time. Consequently, deep learning architectures designed to learn on EEG data have yielded relatively shallow models and performances at best similar to those of traditional feature-based approaches. However, in most situations, unlabeled data is available in abundance. By extracting information from this unlabeled data, it might be possible to reach competitive performance with deep neural networks despite limited access to labels. Approach. We investigated self-supervised learning (SSL), a promising technique for discovering structure in unlabeled data, to learn representations of EEG signals. Specifically, we explored two tasks based on temporal context prediction as well as contrastive predictive coding on two clinically-relevant problems: EEG-based sleep staging and pathology detection. We conducted experiments on two large public datasets with thousands of recordings and performed baseline comparisons with purely supervised and hand-engineered approaches. Main results. Linear classifiers trained on SSL-learned features consistently outperformed purely supervised deep neural networks in low-labeled data regimes while reaching competitive performance when all labels were available. Additionally, the embeddings learned with each method revealed clear latent structures related to physiological and clinical phenomena, such as age effects. Significance. We demonstrate the benefit of SSL approaches on EEG data. Our results suggest that self-supervision may pave the way to a wider use of deep learning models on EEG data.

However, personalities exist in neurophysiological responses among different users of the brain-computer interface leads to a difficulty for designing a generic emotion recognizer that is adaptable to a novel individual. It thus brings an obstacle to achieve cross-subject emotion recognition (ER). To tackle this issue, in this study we propose a novel feature selection method, manifold feature fusion and dynamical feature selection (MF-DFS), under transfer learning principle to determine generalizable features that are stably sensitive to emotional variations. The MF-DFS framework takes the advantages of local geometrical information feature selection, domain adaptation based manifold learning, and dynamical feature selection to enhance the accuracy of the ER system. Based on three public databases, DEAP, MAHNOB-HCI and SEED, the performance of the MF-DFS is validated according to the leave-one-subject-out paradigm under two types of electroencephalography features. By defining three emotional classes of each affective dimension, the accuracy of the MF-DFS-based ER classifier is achieved at 0.50-0.48 (DEAP) and 0.46-0.50 (MAHNOBHCI) for arousal and valence emotional dimensions, respectively. For the SEED database, it achieves 0.40 for the valence dimension. The corresponding accuracy is significantly superior to several classical feature selection methods on multiple machine learning models.

One of its important applications is the evaluation of the mental state of an individual, such as workload estimation. In previous works, common spatial pattern feature extraction methods have been proposed for the EEG-based workload detection. Recently, several novel methods were introduced to detect EEG pattern workloads. However, it is still unknown which one of these methods is the one that offers the best performance for the workload EEG pattern feature detection. In this article, four methods were used to extract workload EEG features: (a) common spatial pattern feature extraction; (b) temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern feature extraction; (c) EEGnet; and (d) the new proposed shallow convolutional neural network for workload estimation (WLnet). The classification accuracy of these four methods was compared. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WLnet achieved the best detection accuracy in both stress and non-stress conditions. We believe that the proposed methods may be relevant to real-life applications of mental workload estimation.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of commonly used supervised machine learning algorithms in the classification of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) history from those with stroke history and/or normal EEG. Methods: Support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models were generated with a diverse feature set from Temple EEG Corpus for both two-class classification of patients with TBI history from normal subjects and three-class classification of TBI, stroke and normal subjects. Results: For two-class classification, an accuracy of 0.94 was achieved in 10-fold cross validation (CV), and 0.76 in independent validation (IV). For three-class classification, 0.85 and 0.71 accuracy were reached in CV and IV respectively. Overall, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) feature selection and SVM models consistently performed well in both CV and IV and for both two-class and three-class classification. Compared to normal control, both TBI and stroke patients showed an overall reduction in coherence and relative PSD in delta frequency, and an increase in higher frequency (alpha, mu, beta and gamma) power. But stroke patients showed a greater degree of change and had additional global decrease in theta power. Conclusions: Our study suggests that EEG data-driven machine learning can be a useful tool for TBI classification. Significance: Our study provides preliminary evidence that EEG ML algorithm can potentially provide specificity to separate different neurological conditions.

Prediction of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis using nonlinear measures of language-related EEG at 6 and 12 months	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						EEG; Autism; Language development; Machine learning; Infant; Sensitive period	CLASSIFYING DEPRESSION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EARLY BRAIN; INFANTS; RISK; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PATTERNS; CHILDREN; FEATURES	Background Early identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) provides an opportunity for early intervention and improved developmental outcomes. The use of electroencephalography (EEG) in infancy has shown promise in predicting later ASD diagnoses and in identifying neural mechanisms underlying the disorder. Given the high co-morbidity with language impairment, we and others have speculated that infants who are later diagnosed with ASD have altered language learning, including phoneme discrimination. Phoneme learning occurs rapidly in infancy, so altered neural substrates during the first year of life may serve as early, accurate indicators of later autism diagnosis. Methods Using EEG data collected at two different ages during a passive phoneme task in infants with high familial risk for ASD, we compared the predictive accuracy of a combination of feature selection and machine learning models at 6 months (during native phoneme learning) and 12 months (after native phoneme learning), and we identified a single model with strong predictive accuracy (100%) for both ages. Samples at both ages were matched in size and diagnoses (n = 14 with later ASD; n = 40 without ASD). Features included a combination of power and nonlinear measures across the 10-20 montage electrodes and 6 frequency bands. Predictive features at each age were compared both by feature characteristics and EEG scalp location. Additional prediction analyses were performed on all EEGs collected at 12 months; this larger sample included 67 HR infants (27 HR-ASD, 40 HR-noASD). Results Using a combination of Pearson correlation feature selection and support vector machine classifier, 100% predictive diagnostic accuracy was observed at both 6 and 12 months. Predictive features differed between the models trained on 6- versus 12-month data. At 6 months, predictive features were biased to measures from central electrodes, power measures, and frequencies in the alpha range. At 12 months, predictive features were more distributed between power and nonlinear measures, and biased toward frequencies in the beta range. However, diagnosis prediction accuracy substantially decreased in the larger, more behaviorally heterogeneous 12-month sample. Conclusions These results demonstrate that speech processing EEG measures can facilitate earlier identification of ASD but emphasize the need for age-specific predictive models with large sample sizes to develop clinically relevant classification algorithms.

Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) classification is regarded as a promising technology for brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which help people to communicate with the outside world using neural activities. However, decoding human intent accurately is a challenging task because of its small signal-to-noise ratio and non-stationary characteristics. Methods that directly extract features from raw EEG signals ignores key frequency domain information. One of the challenges in MI classification tasks is finding a way to supplement the frequency domain information ignored by the raw EEG signal. Approach. In this study, we fuse different models using their complementary characteristics to develop a multiscale space-time-frequency feature-guided multitask learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The proposed method consists of four modules: the space-time feature-based representation module, time-frequency feature-based representation module, multimodal fused feature-guided generation module, and classification module. The proposed framework is based on multitask learning. The four modules are trained using three tasks simultaneously and jointly optimized. Results. The proposed method is evaluated using three public challenge datasets. Through quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques for EEG classification, thereby demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method. Moreover, the proposed method is employed to realize control of robot based on EEG signal, verifying its feasibility in real-time applications. Significance. To the best of our knowledge, a deep CNN architecture that fuses different input cases, which have complementary characteristics, has not been applied to BCI tasks. Because of the interaction of the three tasks in the multitask learning architecture, our method can improve the generalization and accuracy of subject-dependent and subject-independent methods with limited annotated data.

It further explores, develops, and applies a methodology based on the NeuCube BI-SNN, that includes methods for EEG data encoding, data mapping into a 3-dimensional BI-SNN model, unsupervised learning using spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule, spike-driven supervised learning, output classification, network analysis, and model visualisation and interpretation. The research conducted to model different emotional subtypes through mapping both space (brain regions) and time (brain dynamics) components of EEG brain data into SNN architecture. Here, a benchmark EEG dataset was used to design an empirical study that consisted of different experiments for classification of emotions. The obtained accuracy of 94.83% for EEG classification of four types of emotions was superior when compared with traditional machine learning techniques. The BI-SNN models not only detected the brain activity patterns related to positive and negative emotions with a high accuracy, but also revealed new knowledge about the brain areas activated in relation to different emotions. The research confirmed that neural activation increased in the frontal sites of brain (F7, F3, AF4) associated with positive emotions, while in the case of the negative emotions, connectivity strength was concentrated in the frontal (F4, AF3, F7, F8) and parietal sites of the brain (P7, P8).

The aim of this study is to develop an EEG-based CAD system for diagnosis of PTSD patients. To this end, eyes-closed resting-state EEG data were recorded from 77 PTSD patients and 58 healthy controls. Two different types of functional connectivity-based features were extracted, i.e., phase locking values (PLVs) and network indices (strength, clustering coefficient, and path length), for both sensor- and source-level. The classification performances of each feature set were evaluated using a support vector machine with leave-one out cross-validation. The best classification performance was achieved when using source-level PLVs (accuracy - 70.37% and area under curve (AUC) - 0.85). In our future studies, we will attempt to enhance the performance of our proposed CAD system by using deep-learning algorithms.

This study proposes a method of EEG segmentation for imagined speech events, which is further used to train machine learning models for EEG decoding. An experiment was performed where EEG data were collected from four subjects performing imagined as well as overt speech tasks for six words. The audio signals were recorded too during the overt speech task for extracting the onset/offset time during the utterance of the presented word. An EEG template was created using onset/offset timestamps obtained from audio annotation. The EEG signal during the imagined speech task was segmented from continuously recorded data using template matching. Features from delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high gamma frequency bands were extracted from the extracted segments and used for the training of the classifiers. The proposed method of data segmentation shows an improvement of 9.38% in classification accuracy over the existing method.

Moreover, VAE has been compared with standard fast fixed-point algorithm for independent component analysis (FastICA) algorithm to measure the performance quantitatively by using machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.

For the digital biomarker of dementia onset detection, we examine shallow- and deep-learning machine learning models. We report the best median accuracies in a range of 90% for random forest and fully connected neural network classifier models in both emotional faces learning and evaluation experimental tasks.

Topological Data Analysis as a New Tool for EEG Processing	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						topological data analysis (TDA); electroencephalography (EEG); persistent homology; brain-computer interface (BCI); machine learning		Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used cerebral activity measuring device for both clinical and everyday life applications. In addition to denoising and potential classification, a crucial step in EEG processing is to extract relevant features. Topological data analysis (TDA) as an emerging tool enables to analyse and understand data from a different angle than traditionally used methods. As a higher dimensional analogy of graph analysis, TDA can model rich interactions beyond pairwise relations. It also distinguishes different dynamics of EEG time series. TDA remains largely unknown to the EEG processing community while it fits well the heterogeneous nature of EEG signals. This short review aims to give a quick introduction to TDA and how it can be applied to EEG analysis in various applications including brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). After introducing the objective of the article, the main concepts and ideas of TDA are explained. Next, how to implement it for EEG processing is detailed, and lastly the article discusses the benefits and limitations of the method.

Such studies involve collecting electroencephalographic (EEG) data from subjects to train classifiers for decoding users' mental states. However, various sources of inter or intrasubject variabilities in brain signals render training classifiers in BCI systems challenging. From a machine learning perspective, this model training generally follows a common methodology: 1) apply some type of feature extraction, which can be time-consuming and may require domain knowledge and 2) train a classifier using extracted features. The advent of deep learning technologies has offered unprecedented opportunities to not only construct remarkably accurate classifiers but also to integrate the feature extraction stage into the classifier construction. Although integrating feature extraction, which is generally domain-dependent, into the classifier construction is a considerable advantage of deep learning models, the process of architecture selection for BCIs generally depends on domain knowledge. In this study, we examine the feasibility of conducting a systematic model selection combined with mainstream deep learning architectures to construct accurate classifiers for decoding P300 event-related potentials. In particular, we present the results of 232 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (4 datasets x 58 structures), 36 long short-term memory cells (LSTMs) (4 datasets x 9 structures), and 320 hybrid CNN-LSTM models (4 datasets x 80 structures) of varying complexity. Our empirical results show that in the classification of P300 waveforms, the constructed predictive models can outperform the current state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, which are partially or entirely inspired by domain knowledge.

For this purpose, we designed an acquisition protocol based on alternating relaxing and stressful scenes in the form of a VR interactive simulation, accompanied by an EEG headset to monitor the subject's psycho-physical condition. Relaxation scenes were developed based on scenarios created for psychotherapy treatment utilizing bilateral stimulation, while the Stroop test worked as a stressor. The experiment was conducted on a group of 28 healthy adult volunteers (office workers), participating in a VR session. Subjects' EEG signal was continuously monitored using the EMOTIV EPOC Flex wireless EEG head cap system. After the session, volunteers were asked to re-fill questionnaires regarding the current stress level and mood. Then, we classified the stress level using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and compared the classification performance with conventional machine learning algorithms. The best results were obtained considering all brain waves (96.42%) with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.

These deep models are computationally intensive, it takes a longer time to train the model. Also, it is difficult to achieve high classification performance using for emotion classification using machine learning techniques. To overcome these limitations, we present a hand-crafted conventional EEG emotion classification network. In this work, we have used novel prime pattern and tunable q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) techniques to develop an automated model to classify human emotions. Our proposed cognitive model comprises feature extraction, feature selection, and classification steps. We have used TQWT on the EEG signals to obtain the sub-bands. The prime pattern and statistical feature generator are employed on the generated sub-bands and original signal to generate 798 features. 399 (half of them) out of 798 features are selected using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) selector, and misclassification rates of each signal are evaluated using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed network generated 87 feature vectors hence, this model is named PrimePatNet87. In the last step of the feature generation, the best 20 feature vectors which are selected based on the calculated misclassification rates, are concatenated. The generated feature vector is subjected to the feature selection and the most significant 1000 features are selected using the mRMR selector. These selected features are then classified using an SVM classifier. In the last phase, iterative majority voting has been used to generate a general result. We have used three publicly available datasets, namely DEAP, DREAMER, and GAMEEMO, to develop our proposed model. Our presented PrimePatNet87 model reached over 99% classification accuracy on whole datasets with leave one subject out (LOSO) validation. Our results demonstrate that the developed prime pattern network is accurate and ready for real-world applications.

This paper compares ensemble classification framework with individual classifiers. The main objective is to reduce the inference of non-stationary and transient information and improves the classification decision in BCI system. The framework comprises the three phases as follows: (1) the EEG signal first decomposes into triadic frequency bands: low pass band, band pass filter and high pass filter to localize alpha, beta and high gamma frequency bands within the EEG signals, (2) Then, Common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm has been applied on the extracted frequencies in phase Ito heave out the important features of EEG signal, (3) Further, an existing Dynamic Weighted Majiority (DWM) ensemble classification algorithm has been implemented using features extracted in phase II, for final class label decision. J48, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers used as base classifiers for making a diverse ensemble of classifiers. A comparative study between individual classifiers and ensemble framework has been included in the paper. Experimental evaluation and assessment of the performance of the proposed model is done on the publically available datasets: BCI Competition IV dataset Ha and BCI Competition III dataset IVa. The ensemble based learning method gave the highest accuracy among all. The average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 85.4%, 86.5%, and 85.6% were achieved with a kappa value of 0.59 using DWM classification.

It determines what customers actually want through preference prediction. The performance of EEG-based preference detection systems depends on a suitable selection of feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. In this study, We examined preference detection of neuromarketing dataset using different feature combinations of EEG indices and different algorithms for feature extraction and classification. For EEG feature extraction, we employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and power spectral density (PSD), which were utilized to measure the EEG-based preference indices that enhance the accuracy of preference detection. Moreover, we compared deep learning with other traditional classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). We also studied the effect of preference indicators on the performance of classification algorithms. Through rigorous offline analysis, we investigated the computational intelligence for preference detection and classification. The performance of the proposed deep neural network (DNN) outperforms KNN and SVM in accuracy, precision, and recall; however, RF achieved results similar to those of the DNN for the same dataset.

To resolve this issue, they can be complemented with auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms, which decode the attention using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. State-of-the-art AAD algorithms employ a stimulus reconstruction approach, in which the envelope of the attended source is reconstructed from the EEG and correlated with the envelopes of the individual sources. This approach, however, performs poorly on short signal segments, while-longer segments yield impractically long detection delays when the user switches attention. Methods: We propose decoding the directional focus of attention using filter-bank common spatial pattern filters (FB-CSP) as an alternative AAD paradigm, whichdoes not require access to the clean source envelopes. Results: The proposed FB-CSP approach outperforms both the stimulus reconstruction approach on short signal segments, as well as a convolutional neural network approach on the same task. We achieve a high accuracy (80% for 1 s windows and 70% for quasi-instantaneous decisions), which is sufficient to reach minimal expected switch durations below 4 s. We also demonstrate that the decoder can adapt to unlabeled data from anunseen subject and works with only a subset of EEG channels located around the ear to emulate a wearable EEG setup. Conclusion: The proposed FB-CSP method provides fast and accurate decoding of the directional focus of auditory attention. Significance: The high accuracy on very short data segments is a major step forward towards practical neuro-steered hearing devices.

An aspect that can affect the learning process but is not taken into consideration by traditional ITS is the affective state of the learner. In this work, we propose the use of physiological signals and machine learning for the task of detecting a learner's affective state during test taking. To this end, wearable physiological sensors were used to record electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electromyography (EMG) signals from 27 individuals while participating in a computerised English language test. Features extracted from the acquired signals were used in order to train machine learning models for the prediction of the self-reported difficulty level of the test's questions, as well as for the prediction of whether the questions would be answered correctly. Supervised classification experiments showed that there is a relation between the acquired signals and the examined tasks, reaching a classification F1-score of 74.21% for the prediction of the self-reported question difficulty level, and a classification F1-score of 59.14% for predicting whether a question was answered correctly. The acquired results demonstrate the potential of the examined approach for enhancing ITS with information relating to the affective state of the learners.

However, most of the previous studies have empirically selected a window size of Is to extract the CSP-features and did not employ any post-processing technique such as the majority voting technique. The aim of this study is to classify hand and foot movement tasks using EEG data from fourteen healthy subjects (20-30 years) and four machine-learning (ML) algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). The CSP features were extracted from various window sizes ranging between 0.3s to 2s. In the post-processing stage, the number of votes was varied between 1 and 9. The results show that the KNN can achieve 78.9% accuracy using 2s window sizes with 9 votes. However, the ranking analysis using both accuracy and area under the curve values reveals that the RF algorithm can consistently perform well using different window sizes and number of votes. The prediction accuracy was higher for foot MI compared to hand MI; however, the difference was not significant (p>0.05). The overall mean accuracy could be improved by 13.7% using LDA, 8.2% using SVM, 13.7% using KNN, and 6.6% using RF while varying window size and number of votes. The results of this study are valuable for improving MI task classification as well as in developing control function for prosthetics and exoskeleton devices. Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.

Despite careful screening, it remains difficult to determine severity of alpha-synucleinopathy involvement which influences the risk of postoperative complications including cognitive deterioration. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) reflects cognitive dysfunction in PD and may provide biomarkers of postoperative cognitive decline. Objective To develop an automated machine learning model based on preoperative EEG data to predict cognitive deterioration 1 year after STN DBS. Methods Sixty DBS candidates were included; 42 patients had available preoperative EEGs to compute a fully automated machine learning model. Movement Disorder Society criteria classified patients as cognitively stable or deteriorated at 1-year follow-up. A total of 16,674 EEG-features were extracted per patient; a Boruta algorithm selected EEG-features to reflect representative neurophysiological signatures for each class. A random forest classifier with 10-fold cross-validation with Bayesian optimization provided class-differentiation. Results Tweny-five patients were classified as cognitively stable and 17 patients demonstrated cognitive decline. The model differentiated classes with a mean (SD) accuracy of 0.88 (0.05), with a positive predictive value of 91.4% (95% CI 82.9, 95.9) and negative predictive value of 85.0% (95% CI 81.9, 91.4). Predicted probabilities between classes were highly differential (hazard ratio 11.14 [95% CI 7.25, 17.12]); the risk of cognitive decline in patients with high probabilities of being prognosticated as cognitively stable (>0.5) was very limited. Conclusions Preoperative EEGs can predict cognitive deterioration after STN DBS with high accuracy. Cortical neurophysiological alterations may indicate future cognitive decline and can be used as biomarkers during the DBS screening. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Central to the utility of EEG-fMRI neuroimaging systems are the methods for fusing the two data streams, with machine learning playing a key role. These methods can be dichotomized into those that are symmetric and asymmetric in terms of how the two modalities inform the fusion. Studies using these methods have shown that fusion yields new insights into brain function that are not possible when each modality is acquired separately. As technology improves and methods for fusion become more sophisticated, the future of EEG-fMRI for noninvasive measurement of brain dynamics includes mesoscale mapping at ultrahigh magnetic resonance fields, targeted perturbation-based neuroimaging, and using deep learning to uncover nonlinear representations that link the electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements.

J	Anuragi, A; Sisodia, DS; Pachori, RB				Anuragi, Arti; Sisodia, Dilip Singh; Pachori, Ram Bilas			Automated FBSE-EWT based learning framework for detection of epileptic seizures using time-segmented EEG signals	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Accumulated features; Epilepsy; CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset; EEG signals; FBSE-EWT; LS-SVM classifier	LINE LENGTH FEATURE; LEAST-SQUARES; PHASE-SPACE; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; PATTERN	Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that has severely affected many people's lives across the world. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used to characterize the brain's state and detect various disorders. The EEG signals are non-stationary and non-linear in nature. Therefore, it is challenging to accurately process and learn from the recorded EEG signals in order to detect disorders like epilepsy. This paper proposed an automated learning framework using the Fourier-Bessel series expansion-based empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) method for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG signals. The scale-space boundary detection method was adopted to segment the Fourier-Bessel series expansion (FBSE) spectrum of multiple frame-size time-segmented EEG signals. Multiple frame-size time-segmented EEG signal's analysis was done using four different frame sizes: full, half, quarter, and half-quarter length of recorded EEG signals. Two different time-segmentation approaches were investigated on EEG signals: 1) segmenting signals based on multiple frame-size and 2) segmenting signals based on multiple frame-size with zero-padding the remaining signal. The FBSE-EWT method was applied to decompose the EEG signals into narrow sub-band signals. Features such as line-length (LL), log-energy-entropy (LEnt), and norm-entropy (NEnt) were computed from various frequency range sub-band signals. The relief-F feature ranking method was employed to select the most significant features; this reduces the computational burden of the models. The top-ranked accumulated features were used for classification using least square support machine learning (LS-SVM), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and ensemble bagged tree classifiers. The proposed framework for epileptic seizure detection was evaluated on two publicly available benchmark EEG datasets: the Bonn EEG dataset and Children's Hospital Boston (CHB) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), well known as the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. Training and testing of the models were performed using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. The FBSE-EWT based learning framework was compared with other state-of-the-art methods using both datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework achieved 100 % classification accuracy on the Bonn EEG dataset, whereas 99.84 % classification accuracy on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset.

Although the linear model-based method has been widely used in AAD, the linear assumption was considered oversimplified and the decoding accuracy remained lower for shorter decoding windows. Recently, nonlinear models based on deep neural networks (DNN) have been proposed to solve this problem. However, these models did not fully utilize both the spatial and temporal features of EEG, and the interpretability of DNN models was rarely investigated. In this paper, we proposed novel convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) based regression model and classification model, and compared them with both the linear model and the state-of-the-art DNN models. Results showed that, our proposed CRNN-based classification model outperformed others for shorter decoding windows (around 90% for 2 s and 5 s). Although worse than classification models, the decoding accuracy of the proposed CRNN-based regression model was about 5% greater than other regression models. The interpretability of DNN models was also investigated by visualizing layers' weight.

Meta Learning is a way of training machine learning systems so they learn to learn. We apply here meta learning to a simple Deep Learning BCI architecture and compare it to transfer learning on the same architecture. Our Meta learning strategy operates by finding optimal parameters for the BCI decoder so that it can quickly generalise between different users and recording sessions thereby also generalising to new users or new sessions quickly. We tested our algorithm on the Physionet EEG motor imagery dataset. Our approach increased motor imagery classification accuracy between 60 to 80%, outperforming other algorithms under the little-data condition. We believe that establishing the meta learning or learning-to-learn approach will help neural engineering and human interfacing with the challenges of quickly setting up decoders of neural signals to make them more suitable for daily-life.

J	Ketu, S; Mishra, PK				Ketu, Shwet; Mishra, Pramod Kumar			Hybrid classification model for eye state detection using electroencephalogram signals	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Eye state detection; Machine learning; EEG signals; Health care; Prediction model	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; FEATURES; CHANNEL; SYSTEM	The electroencephalography (EEG) signal is an essential source of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology implementation. The BCI is nothing but a non-muscle communication medium among the external devices and the brain. The basic concept of BCI is to enable the interaction among the neurological ill patients to others with the help of brain signals. EEG signal classification is an essential requirement for various applications such as motor imagery classification, drug effects diagnosis, emotion classification, seizure prediction/detection, eye state prediction/detection, and so on. Thus, there is a need for an efficient classification model that can deal with the EEG datasets more adequately with better classification accuracy, which will further help in developing the automatic solution for the medical domain. In this paper, we have introduced a hybrid classification model for eye state detection using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This hybrid classification model has been evaluated with the other traditional machine learning models, eight classification models (Prepossessed + Hypertuned) and six state-of-the-art methods to assess its appropriateness and correctness. This proposed classification model establishes a machine learning-based hybrid model for the classification of eye state using EEG signals with greater exactness. It is also capable of solving the issue of outlier detection and removal to address the class imbalance problem, which will offer the solution toward building the robotic or smart machine-based solution for social well-being.

We have performed an experiment in which a 32 channel industry-standard electroencephalography (EEG) device was used to record 26 imagined English alphabets from 13 subjects. We denoised the imagined signals by discrete wavelet transform and extracted the spatial filters by common spatial pattern method, and time-domain features. Spatial features when classified with linear support vector machine, and time-domain features classified by random forest gave the best results. Alpha, beta, and theta bands could classify imagined alphabets better than other bands and had average classification accuracies of 88.59%, 87.39%, and 88.97%, respectively by using spatial features and 81.88%, 76.72%, and 79.25%, respectively, by time-domain features. The grand average accuracies of all the 26 alphabets in six EEG frequency bands was found to be 77.97% in a subject independent binary classification framework.

This study aims to develop a machine learning model to classify children with ADHD and Healthy Controls. In this study, EEG signals captured under cognitive tasks were obtained from an open-access database of 60 children with ADHD and 60 Healthy Controls children of similar age. The regional contributions towards attaining higher accuracy are identified and further tested using three classifiers: AdaBoost, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The EEG data from 19 channels is taken as input features in individual and combinatorial sets to classifiers. Evaluating all the classifiers' overall performance, the highest accuracy of 84% is obtained with the AdaBoost classifier when all the Right Hemisphere channels are taken into consideration. The higher sensitivity of 96% indicates a better true positive detection rate of the model created with the Right Hemisphere features. This study highlights the intrinsic physiological contrast prevalent in brain activity of ADHD and healthy children, which can be effectively utilized for diagnostic purposes.

Our understanding of this has advanced substantially with the development of multivariate decoding analyses. However, conventional electroencephalography (EEG) decoding predominantly uses the mean neural activation within the analysis window to extract category information. Such temporal averaging overlooks the within-trial neural variability that is suggested to provide an additional channel for the encoding of information about the complexity and uncertainty of the sensory input. The richness of temporal variabilities, however, has not been systematically compared with the conventional mean activity. Here we compare the information content of 31 variability-sensitive features against the mean of activity, using three independent highly varied data sets. In whole-trial decoding, the classical event-related potential (ERP) components of P2a and P2b provided information comparable to those provided by original magnitude data (OMD) and wavelet coefficients (WC), the two most informative variability-sensitive features. In time-resolved decoding, the OMD and WC outperformed all the other features (including the mean), which were sensitive to limited and specific aspects of temporal variabilities, such as their phase or frequency. The information was more pronounced in the theta frequency band, previously suggested to support feedforward visual processing. We concluded that the brain might encode the information in multiple aspects of neural variabilities simultaneously such as phase, amplitude, and frequency rather than mean per se. In our active categorization data set, we found that more effective decoding of the neural codes corresponds to better prediction of behavioral performance. Therefore, the incorporation of temporal variabilities in time-resolved decoding can provide additional category information and improved prediction of behavior.

Physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) measure the neuronal and cardiac activities associated with different emotional states. The complex biological activities result in a highly nonstationary nature of the acquired physiological signals, requiring advanced signal processing and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify and classify hidden patterns. This paper proposes a three-step process for comprehensive analysis and classification of human emotional states. The first step comprises decomposing physiological signals into reconstructed components (RCs) using sliding mode singular spectrum analysis (SM-SSA). In the second step, the discriminatory features such as information potential (IP) and centered correntropy (CEC) were computed from the extracted RCs. Afterward, the extracted features were considered input to various ML classifiers to discriminate human emotional states in the third step. The proposed method was studied over two publicly available databases, DREAMER and AMIGOS, for emotion analysis and achieved the highest classification accuracy of 92.38% in classifying human emotions. The obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed method can identify different human emotional states and yield better performance than existing emotion recognition methods.

Rajendra			Automated identification of insomnia using optimal bi-orthogonal wavelet transform technique with single-channel EEG signals	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						EEG (electroencephalography); PSG (polysomnographic); Sleep disorders; Insomnia; Machine learning; Classification; EBDT (ensemble bagged decision trees); Sleep stages	FILTER BANKS; SLEEP EEG; DESIGN; DIAGNOSIS; BASES	Nowadays, sleep studies have gained a lot of attention from researchers due to the immense importance of quality sleep. Human beings spend nearly one-third of their lives in sleep. Therefore, adequate quality sleep is indispensable for a healthy life. The sleep pattern may not be the same for every individual as one may either suffer from various sleep ailments such as insomnia, apnea, bruxism, epilepsy, narcolepsy, or maybe healthy with no sleep disorder. Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder that can lead to many health-related issues in human beings. Usually, polysomnogram (PSG) signals are used to detect the sleep stages and sleep disorders. The PSG signals are difficult to handle, time-consuming, and not convenient for patients. Hence, in this work, we have used single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect insomnia automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on automated insomnia identification using the CAP database and EEG alone. We have used the single-channel EEG channel and created eight different subsets based on sleep-stages annotations according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines for sleep stage scoring. The classification task is performed on each subset for the automated identification of insomnia. A new class of an optimal bi-orthogonal filter bank is used for wavelet decomposition. The wavelet-based norm features are extracted using the optimal filter bank. Then these features are fed to various machine learning algorithms. The proposed model has attained the highest classification performance with the area under receivers' operating characteristic curve (AROC) of 0.97, F1-score of 0.9645, the accuracy of 95.60%, and Cohen's Kappa value of 0.9067 using an ensemble bagged decision trees (EBDT) classifier. Our developed model can be used to detect insomnia using sleep EEG signals accurately and provide early treatment. The method is simple and computationally fast. The proposed system can be used at home as well as at sleep labs to monitor insomnia. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Changes in system dynamics caused by user actions, such as picking up a weight, can greatly affect control stability; hence, detecting these changes can lead to improved system performance. It is difficult to integrate conventional sensing technologies for completing this task into a wearable device in an unobtrusive way, therefore an alternative solution using bioelectrical signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), to detect task weight is proposed. In this study, EEG and EMG signals were collected during dynamic elbow flexion-extension motion at different speeds, while holding different weights. These biosignals were used to develop different EEG-EMG fusion models to classify the weight the user was holding while moving. It was found that using a Weighted Average fusion method, and incorporating speed information into the model, provided the best performance, with an accuracy of 83.01 +/- 6.04% when classifying three task weights. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using EEG-EMG fusion for classification of task weight during dynamic motion, which can be used to improve the adaptability and robustness of wearable mechatronic rehabilitation devices.

Most of those systems rely on motor imagery that generates different patterns of the electroencephalography signals. However, those phenomenon produce signals with low quality which makes their recognition a troublesome job. Thus, we come up with a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is constructed specially for this application. A multi-branch system is used to preserve and deal with each band separably, which will grant a better classification. By using the dataset BCI IV-2a, we demonstrate that our method achieves better training time compared with the existing CNNs, and better classification compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of the parallel pipelines on the performances by adding them gradually, and we show that adding features extracted from different scales has indeed a positive influence on diverse metrics. Further, we compared the training time of the network with and without Separable and Depthwise convolutional layers, we conclude that they permit the reduction of the training time thanks to their low computational requirement along with the positive impact on the accuracy. We note that there is some benefit in the tasks that provides the weakest patterns. To further clarify the results, we carry out an extensive analysis of the network based on the relevance of the input feature, which explained the failed classification.

Robust Subject-Independent P300 Waveform Classification via Signal Pre-Processing and Deep Learning	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Brain modeling; Electroencephalography; Computational modeling; Deep learning; Machine learning; Electrodes; Feature extraction; Brain-computer interface; deep learning; EEG; P300; machine learning; signal processing	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; TIME	Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are capable of processing neural stimuli using electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements to aid communication capabilities. Yet, BCIs often require extensive calibration steps in order to be tuned to specific users. In this work, we develop a subject independent P300 classification framework, which eliminates the need for user-specific calibration. We begin by employing a series of pre-processing steps, where, among other steps, we consider different trial averaging methodologies and various EEG electrode configurations. We then consider three distinct deep learning architectures and two linear machine learning models as P300 signal classifiers. Through evaluation on three datasets, and in comparison to three benchmark P300 classification frameworks, we find that averaging up to seven trials while using eight specific electrode channels on a two-layered convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to robust subject independent P300 classification. In this capacity, our method achieves greater than a 0.20 gain in AUC in comparison to prior P300 classification methods. In addition, our proposed framework is computationally efficient with training time gains of greater than 3x, compared to linear machine learning models, and online evaluation time speedups of up to 2x compared to benchmark methods.

The selection of time windows and frequency bands prominently affects the performance of CSP algorithms. Concerning the joint optimization of these two parameters, several studies have utilized a unified framework based on different feature selection strategies and achieved considerable improvement. However, during the feature selection process, useful information could be discarded inevitably and the underlying internal structure of features could be neglected. New method: In this paper, we proposed a novel framework termed time window filter bank common spatial pattern with multi-view optimization (TWFBCSP-MVO) to further boost the decoding of MI tasks. Concretely, after extracting CSP features from different time-frequency decompositions of EEG signals, a preliminary screening strategy based on variance ratio was devised to filter out the unrelated spatial patterns. We then introduced a multi-view learning strategy for the simultaneous optimization of time windows and frequency bands. A support vector machine classifier was trained to determine the output of the brain. Results: An experimental study was conducted on two public datasets to verify the effectiveness of TWFBCSPMVO. Results showed that the proposed TWFBCSP-MVO could help improve the performance of MI classification. Comparison with existing methods: In comparison to other competing methods, the proposed method performed significantly better (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The proposed method is a promising contestant to improve the performance of practical MI-based BCIs.

The novelty of the solution proposed relies on employing the one-dimensional Local Binary Pattern (1D-LBP) algorithm for feature extraction from pre-processed EEG data. From the resulting feature vector, the classification is done according to three vigilance classes: awake, tired and drowsy. The claim is that the class transitions can be detected by describing the variations of the micro-patterns' occurrences along the EEG signal. The 1D-LBP is able to describe them by detecting mutual variations of the signal temporarily "close" as a short bit-code. Our analysis allows to conclude that the 1D-LBP adoption has led to significant performance improvement. Moreover, capturing the class transitions from the EEG signal is effective, although the overall performance is not yet good enough to develop a BCI for assessing the driver's vigilance in real environments.

Recently sparse representation-based classification (SRC) methods have achieved the good performance in EEG signal automatic detection, by which the EEG signals are sparsely represented using a few active coefficients in the dictionary and classified according to the reconstruction criteria. However, most of SRC learn a linear dictionary for encoding, and cannot extract enough information and nonlinear relationship of data for classification. To solve this problem, a hierarchical discriminative sparse representation classification model (called HD-SRC) for EEG signal detection is proposed. Based on the framework of neural network, HD-SRC learns the hierarchical nonlinear transformation and maps the signal data into the nonlinear transformed space. Through incorporating this idea into label consistent K singular value decomposition (LC-KSVD) at the top layer of neural network, HD-SRC seeks discriminative representation together with dictionary, while minimizing errors of classification, reconstruction and discriminative sparse-code for pattern classification. By learning the hierarchical feature mapping and discriminative dictionary simultaneously, more discriminative information of data can be exploited. In the experiment the proposed model is evaluated on the Bonn EEG database, and the results show it obtains satisfactory classification performance in multiple EEG signal detection tasks.

However, it is difficult to decode FC by the current machine learning techniques because of a lack of physiological understanding. To investigate the suitability of FC in BCIs for the elderly, we propose the decoding of lower- and higher-order FC using a convolutional neural network (CNN) in six cognitive-motor tasks. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method describes how age-related changes in FCs impact BCI applications for the elderly compared to younger adults. A total of 17 young adults 24.5 & PLUSMN;2.7 years and 12 older 72.5 & PLUSMN;3.2 years adults were recruited to perform tasks related to hand-force control with or without mental calculation. The CNN yielded a six-class classification accuracy of 75.3% in the elderly, exceeding the 70.7% accuracy for the younger adults. In the elderly, the proposed method increased the classification accuracy by 88.3% compared to the filter-bank common spatial pattern. The LRP results revealed that both lower- and higher-order FCs were dominantly overactivated in the prefrontal lobe, depending on the task type. These findings suggest a promising application of multi-order FC with deep learning on BCI systems for the elderly.

The objective of this study is to validate the feasibility of a novel electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor-hotspot-identification approach using a machine learning technique as a potential alternative to TMS. Methods EEG data were measured using 63 channels from thirty subjects as they performed a simple finger tapping task. Power spectral densities of the EEG data were extracted from six frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and full) and were independently used to train and test an artificial neural network for motor hotspot identification. The 3D coordinate information of individual motor hotspots identified by TMS were quantitatively compared with those estimated by our EEG-based motor-hotspot-identification approach to assess its feasibility. Results The minimum mean error distance between the motor hotspot locations identified by TMS and our proposed motor-hotspot-identification approach was 0.22 +/- 0.03 cm, demonstrating the proof-of-concept of our proposed EEG-based approach. A mean error distance of 1.32 +/- 0.15 cm was measured when using only nine channels attached to the middle of the motor cortex, showing the possibility of practically using the proposed motor-hotspot-identification approach based on a relatively small number of EEG channels. Conclusion We demonstrated the feasibility of our novel EEG-based motor-hotspot-identification method. It is expected that our approach can be used as an alternative to TMS for motor hotspot identification. In particular, its usability would significantly increase when using a recently developed portable tES device integrated with an EEG device.

Electroencephalography-derived functional connectivity (EEG-FC) provides relevant characteristic information about individual differences in cognitive tasks and personality traits. However, it remains unclear whether these individual-dependent EEG-FCs remain relatively permanent across long-term sessions. This manuscript utilizes machine learning algorithms to explore the individual specificity and permanence of resting-state EEG connectivity patterns. We performed six recordings at different intervals during a six-month period to examine the variation and permanence of resting-state EEG-FC over a long period. The results indicated that the EEG-FC networks are quite subject-specific with a high-precision identification accuracy of greater than 90%. Meanwhile, the individual specificity remained stable and only varied slightly after six months. Furthermore, the specificity is mainly derived from the internal connectivity of the frontal lobe. Our work demonstrates the existence of specific and permanent EEG-FC patterns in the brain, providing potential information for biometric applications.

One of the new technologies to monitor drivers is by using the EEG signals, which provides vital signs monitoring of fatigue and distraction. However, monitoring systems involving full-head scalp EEG are time-consuming and uncomfortable for the driver. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of recently introduced forehead EEG for train driver fatigue and distraction detection. We first constructed a unique dataset with experienced train drivers driving in a simulated train driving environment. The EEG signals were collected from an EEG recording device placed on the driver's forehead, and numerous features including energy, entropy, rhythmic energy ratio and frontal asymmetry ratio were extracted from the EEG signals. Therefore, a time-series ensemble learning method was proposed to perform fatigue and distraction detection based on the extracted feature. The proposed method outperforms other popular machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree(DT), and Long short-term memory(LSTM). The proposed method is stable and convenient to meet the real-time requirement of train driver monitoring.

J	Narayanan, AM; Zink, R; Bertrand, A				Narayanan, Abhijith Mundanad; Zink, Rob; Bertrand, Alexander			EEG miniaturization limits for stimulus decoding with EEG sensor networks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; auditory attention decoding; miniaturization; neural decoding; neural signal processing	SELECTION; SPEECH; BRAIN	Objective. Unobtrusive electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring in everyday life requires the availability of highly miniaturized EEG devices (mini-EEGs), which ideally consist of a wireless node with a small scalp area footprint, in which the electrodes, amplifier and wireless radio are embedded. By attaching a multitude of mini-EEGs at relevant positions on the scalp, a wireless 'EEG sensor network' (WESN) can be formed. However, each mini-EEG in the network only has access to its own local electrodes, thereby recording local scalp potentials with short inter-electrode distances. This is unlike using traditional cap-EEG, which by the virtue of re-referencing can measure EEG across arbitrarily large distances on the scalp. We evaluate the implications and limitations of such far-driven miniaturization on neural decoding performance. Approach. We collected 255-channel EEG data in an auditory attention decoding (AAD) task. As opposed to previous studies with a lower channel density, this new high-density dataset allows emulation of mini-EEGs with inter-electrode distances down to 1 cm in order to identify and quantify the lower bound on miniaturization for EEG-based stimulus decoding. Main results. We demonstrate that the performance remains reasonably stable for inter-electrode distances down to 3 cm, but decreases quickly for shorter distances if the mini-EEG nodes can be placed at optimal scalp locations and orientations selected by a data-driven algorithm. Significance. The results indicate the potential for the use of mini-EEGs in a WESN context for AAD applications and provide guidance on inter-electrode distances while designing such devices for neuro-steered hearing devices.

One of the key objectives in healthcare is the early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. Here we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques in early prediction of seizures using EEG signals. We will identify the gaps, challenges, and pitfalls in the current research and recommend future directions.

With the ever advancing machine learning and neural network computational power, several models have been proposed for classifying the emotion states. Training an efficient classifier requires selection of appropriate features demanding complex computations. The present article investigates whether dense convolutional neural networks can extract the features from just pre-processed raw EEG signals enabling a suitability for online classification. The article presents a fully connected multi-channel neural network model comprising of dense convolutional layers coupled with sparse autoencoder and dense perceptron layers for classifying emotions from 62-channel EEG data. The proposed model uses the dense convolution layers to learn emotion features directly from each channel. The cascaded SAE layer coupled with dense perceptron network learns correlations between the channels for efficient classification. In addition, different methods exist to generate training and testing sets for validating classifier models. In this light, the article discusses three most recent methods to generate training and testing sets employed in emotion classification. The proposed model achieves a best testing accuracy of 97.42 %.

We included 304 cognitively normal individuals from the INSIGHT-preAD cohort. Amyloid and neurodegeneration were assessed on F-18-florbetapir and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, respectively. We used a nested cross-validation approach with non-invasive features (electroencephalography [EEG], APOE4 genotype, demographic, neuropsychological and MRI data) to predict: 1/ amyloid status; 2/ neurodegeneration status; 3/ decline to prodromal AD at 5-year follow-up. Importantly, EEG was most strongly predictive of neurodegeneration, even when reducing the number of channels from 224 down to 4, as 4-channel EEG best predicted neurodegeneration (negative predictive value [NPV] = 82%, positive predictive value [PPV] = 38%, 77% specificity, 45% sensitivity).

The difference among patients impacts the drug choice as well as the surgery procedure. With the advance in machine learning, automatic seizure detection could ease the manual time-consuming and labour-intensive procedure for diagnose seizure in the clinical setting. In this paper, we propose a electroencephalography frequency bands selection method that exploits Natural Language Processing (NLP) features from individual's condition and patients with same seizure types. We used Temple University Hospital (TUH) EEG seizure corpus and conducted experiments with various input data for different seizure types classified using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results show that with reduced frequency bands the performance slightly deviates from the whole frequency bands, thus leading to possible resource-efficient implementation for seizure detection.

EEG data is mostly recorded with higher number of electrodes that can lead to data redundancy and longer experimental setup time. The question "whether the configuration with lesser number of electrodes is common amongst different stimuli presentation paradigms" remains unanswered. There are publicly available datasets for EEG based human emotional states recognition. Since this work is focused towards classifying emotions while subjects are experiencing different stimuli, therefore we need to perform new experiments. Keeping aforementioned issues in consideration, this work presents a novel experimental study that records EEG data for three different human emotional states evoked with four different stimuli presentation paradigms. A methodology based on iterative Genetic Algorithm in combination with majority voting has been used to achieve configuration with reduced number of EEG electrodes keeping in consideration minimum loss of classification accuracy. The results obtained are comparable with recent studies. Stimulus independent configurations with lesser number of electrodes lead towards low computational complexity as well as reduced set up time for future EEG based smart systems for emotions recognition	[Masood, Naveen] Bahria Univ, Elect Engn Dept, 13 Natl Stadium Rd, Karachi, Pakistan; [Farooq, Humera] Bahria Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Karachi, Pakistan		Masood, N (corresponding author), Bahria Univ, Elect Engn Dept, 13 Natl Stadium Rd, Karachi, Pakistan.	navinza@hotmail.com			Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan	Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan)	This work is funded by Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan and is being conducted and supervised under the 'Intelligent Systems and Robotics' research group at Computer Science (CS) Department, Bahria University, Karachi, Pakistan.

EEG is a method of (non-)invasive recording of the electrical activity of the brain. This can be used to build BCIs. From the last decade, EEG has grasped researchers' attention to distinguish human activities. However, temporal information has rarely been retained to incorporate temporal information for multi-class (more than two classes) motor imagery classification. This research proposes a long-short-term-memory-based deep learning model to learn the hidden sequential patterns. Two types of features are used to feed the proposed model, including Fourier Transform Energy Maps (FTEMs) and Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) filters. Multiple experiments have been conducted on a publicly available dataset. Extraction of spatial and spectro-temporal features using CSP filters and FTEM allow the sequence-to-sequence based proposed model to learn the hidden sequential features. The proposed method is trained, evaluated, and optimized for a publicly available benchmark data set and resulted in 0.81 mean kappa value. Obtained results depict the model robustness for the artifacts and suitable for real-life applications with comparable classification accuracy.

PLP has been often investigated with the use of functional MRI focusing on the changes that take place in the sensorimotor cortex after amputation. In the present study, we investigated whether a different type of data, namely electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, can be used to study the condition. We acquired resting state EEG data from people with and without PLP and then used machine learning for a binary classification task that differentiates the two. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) decomposition was used as the feature extraction method and two validation schemes were followed for the classification task. Six classifiers (LDA, Log, QDA, LinearSVC, SVC and RF) were optimized through grid search and their performance compared. Two validation approaches, namely all-subjects validation and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), resulted in high classification accuracy. Most notably, the 93.7% accuracy achieved with SVC in LOOCV holds promise for good diagnostic capabilities using EEG biomarkers. In conclusion, our findings indicate that EEG data is a promising target for future research aiming at elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying PLP and its diagnosis.

Accurate Decoding of Imagined and Heard Melodies	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; cortical; TRF; neural tracking; pitch; music; signal processing; decoding	CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; NEURAL RESPONSES; SPEECH; MUSIC	Music perception requires the human brain to process a variety of acoustic and music-related properties. Recent research used encoding models to tease apart and study the various cortical contributors to music perception. To do so, such approaches study temporal response functions that summarise the neural activity over several minutes of data. Here we tested the possibility of assessing the neural processing of individual musical units (bars) with electroencephalography (EEG). We devised a decoding methodology based on a maximum correlation metric across EEG segments (maxCorr) and used it to decode melodies from EEG based on an experiment where professional musicians listened and imagined four Bach melodies multiple times. We demonstrate here that accurate decoding of melodies in single-subjects and at the level of individual musical units is possible, both from EEG signals recorded during listening and imagination. Furthermore, we find that greater decoding accuracies are measured for the maxCorr method than for an envelope reconstruction approach based on backward temporal response functions (bTRF(env)). These results indicate that low-frequency neural signals encode information beyond note timing, especially with respect to low-frequency cortical signals below 1 Hz, which are shown to encode pitch-related information. Along with the theoretical implications of these results, we discuss the potential applications of this decoding methodology in the context of novel brain-computer interface solutions.

The results raise expectations for improving the decodability of decisions in a broader context because the decision is an inherent part of the learning strategies. In this study, we investigated this possibility using various information theory-based methods. First, we trained a simple deep neural network to decode learning strategies from EEG signals collected while human subjects perform a strategy learning task with context changes. We then evaluated the ability of the model to decode subjective decision signals from EEG signals in another decision-making scenario that was not used during training. This zero-training scheme allows us to investigate whether the learning strategy decoder gleans information generalizable to various decision-making scenarios. Notably, we found that the decoder contains a significant amount of mutual information between input, hidden, and output for the new data (decision-making task; p<5e-2), as well as the original training data (strategy learning task; p<1e-2). In subsequent analyses of the neural representations of the model's hidden layers, we found informative features for decoding decisions in its deep layers. The results suggest that decoding learning strategies will help design generalizable EEG decoders.

In the last decade, deep learning has become the state-of-the-art method in many machine learning tasks ranging from speech recognition to image segmentation. The success of deep networks in other domains has led to a new wave of applications in neuroscience. In this article, we review deep learning approaches to neural decoding. We describe the architectures used for extracting useful features from neural recording modalities ranging from spikes to functional magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, we explore how deep learning has been leveraged to predict common outputs including movement, speech and vision, with a focus on how pretrained deep networks can be incorporated as priors for complex decoding targets like acoustic speech or images. Deep learning has been shown to be a useful tool for improving the accuracy and flexibility of neural decoding across a wide range of tasks, and we point out areas for future scientific development.

Every year, a significant number of publications that are related to new improvements, challenges, and breakthrough in MI-BCI are made. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the electroencephalogram (EEG) based MI-BCI system. It describes the current state of the art in different stages of the MI-BCI (data acquisition, MI training, preprocessing, feature extraction, channel and feature selection, and classification) pipeline. Although MI-BCI research has been going for many years, this technology is mostly confined to controlled lab environments. We discuss recent developments and critical algorithmic issues in MI-based BCI for commercial deployment.

Owing to its practicality, electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most widely used measurements for BCI. However, EEG has complex patterns and EEG-based BCIs mostly involve a cost/time-consuming calibration phase; thus, acquiring sufficient EEG data is rarely possible. Recently, deep learning (DL) has had a theoretical/practical impact on BCI research because of its use in learning representations of complex patterns inherent in EEG. Moreover, algorithmic advances in DL facilitate short/zero-calibration in BCI, thereby suppressing the data acquisition phase. Those advancements include data augmentation (DA), increasing the number of training samples without acquiring additional data, and transfer learning (TL), taking advantage of representative knowledge obtained from one dataset to address the so-called data insufficiency problem in other datasets. In this study, we review DL-based short/zero-calibration methods for BCI. Further, we elaborate methodological/algorithmic trends, highlight intriguing approaches in the literature, and discuss directions for further research. In particular, we search for generative model-based and geometric manipulation-based DA methods. Additionally, we categorize TL techniques in DL-based BCIs into explicit and implicit methods. Our systematization reveals advances in the DA and TL methods. Among the studies reviewed herein, similar to 45% of DA studies used generative model-based techniques, whereas similar to 45% of TL studies used explicit knowledge transferring strategy. Moreover, based on our literature review, we recommend an appropriate DA strategy for DL-based BCIs and discuss trends of TLs used in DL-based BCIs.

J	Tiwari, A; Chaturvedi, A				Tiwari, Anurag; Chaturvedi, Amrita			A Novel Channel Selection Method for BCI Classification Using Dynamic Channel Relevance	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Task analysis; Redundancy; Support vector machines; Classification algorithms; Electrodes; Brain-Computer interface; electroencephalography; dynamic channel relevance; multivariate empirical mode decomposition; support vector machine	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; MOTOR IMAGERY; SVM CLASSIFICATION; EEG; MULTICLASS; DIAGNOSIS	Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides a direct communicating pathway between the human brain and the external environment. In the BCI systems, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are used to represent different cognitive patterns corresponding to various limb movements or motor imagery (MI) activities. However, EEG signals are multichannel in nature that require explicit information processing to alleviate the computational complexity of the BCI system. This paper represents a novel channel selection method to find effective EEG channels using Dynamic Channel Relevance (DCR) score. The proposed approach explores the minimum redundancy maximum relevance paradigm for selecting pertinent channels from raw ones. Firstly, the EEG signals are preprocessed using the Savitzky-Golay filter, and a sliding window approach is used to decompose them into chunks of fixed length. Further, three priorly known channels are used as candidate solutions for detecting new correlated channels. The selected channels are used to extract spatial-temporal features using the Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) method. The extracted features are used to discriminate four MI tasks (left hand, right hand, tongue, and foot) using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experiment is validated on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition IV- 2008 - IIA, BCI Competition IV- dataset 1, BCI competition III - dataset IVa). The results show that the proposed method achieved a superior classification accuracy (85.4% on dataset 1, 80.33% on dataset 2, and 85.20% on dataset 3) with a lesser number of channels compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our method significantly reduced the computation time compared to other published results without compromising the classification accuracy. Topographical mapping between the selected channels and cognitive regions showed that the central, frontal, and parietal lobe contributes to the execution of various MI tasks during physical activities.

Conventional electroencephalography (EEG) for motor imagery requires a hair cap with multiple wired electrodes and messy gels, causing motion artifacts. Here, a wireless scalp electronic system with virtual reality for real-time, continuous classification of motor imagery brain signals is introduced. This low-profile, portable system integrates imperceptible microneedle electrodes and soft wireless circuits. Virtual reality addresses subject variance in detectable EEG response to motor imagery by providing clear, consistent visuals and instant biofeedback. The wearable soft system offers advantageous contact surface area and reduced electrode impedance density, resulting in significantly enhanced EEG signals and classification accuracy. The combination with convolutional neural network-machine learning provides a real-time, continuous motor imagery-based brain-machine interface. With four human subjects, the scalp electronic system offers a high classification accuracy (93.22 +/- 1.33% for four classes), allowing wireless, real-time control of a virtual reality game.

Although adaptation operates within individual movements on a trial-to trial basis, it can also undergo learning when adaptive responses improve over the course of many trials. Brain oscillatory activities related to these "adaptation " and "learning " processes remain unclear. The main reason for this is that previous studies principally focused on the beta band, which confined the outcome message to trial-to-trial adaptation. To provide a wider understanding of adaptive learning, we decoded visuomotor tasks with constant, random or no perturbation from EEG recordings in different bandwidths and brain regions using a multiple kernel learning approach. These different experimental tasks were intended to separate trial-to-trial adaptation from the formation of the new visuomotor mapping across trials. We found changes in EEG power in the post-movement period during the course of the visuomotor-constant rotation task, in particular an increased (i) theta power in prefrontal region, (ii) beta power in supplementary motor area, and (iii) gamma power in motor regions. Classifying the visuomotor task with constant rotation versus those with random or no rotation, we were able to relate power changes in beta band mainly to trial-to-trial adaptation to error while changes in theta band would relate rather to the learning of the new mapping. Altogether, this suggested that there is a tight relationship between modulation of the synchronization of low (theta) and higher (essentially beta) frequency oscillations in prefrontal and sensorimotor regions, respectively, and adaptive learning.

High-pass filtering artifacts in multivariate classification of neural time series data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; MEG; High-pass filtering; Preprocessing; Multivariate pattern classification; MVPA; Decoding; Robust detrending		Background: Traditionally, EEG/MEG data are high-pass filtered and baseline-corrected to remove slow drifts. Minor deleterious effects of high-pass filtering in traditional time-series analysis have been well-documented, including temporal displacements. However, its effects on time-resolved multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) are largely unknown. New method: To prevent potential displacement effects, we extend an alternative method of removing slow drift noise ? robust detrending ? with a procedure in which we mask out all cortical events from each trial. We refer to this method as trial-masked robust detrending. Results: In both real and simulated EEG data of a working memory experiment, we show that both high-pass filtering and standard robust detrending create artifacts that result in the displacement of multivariate patterns into activity silent periods, particularly apparent in temporal generalization analyses, and especially in combination with baseline correction. We show that trial-masked robust detrending is free from such displacements. Comparison with existing method(s): Temporal displacement may emerge even with modest filter cut-off settings such as 0.05 Hz, and even in regular robust detrending. However, trial-masked robust detrending results in artifact-free decoding without displacements. Baseline correction may unwittingly obfuscate spurious decoding effects and displace them to the rest of the trial. Conclusions: Decoding analyses benefit from trial-masked robust detrending, without the unwanted side effects introduced by filtering or regular robust detrending. However, for sufficiently clean data sets and sufficiently strong signals, no filtering or detrending at all may work adequately. Implications for other types of data are discussed, followed by a number of recommendations.	[van Driel, Joram; Olivers, Christian N.

Classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals with high accuracy using short recording intervals has been a challenging problem in developing brain computer interfaces (BCIs). This paper presents a novel feature extraction method for EEG recordings to tackle this problem. Approach. The proposed approach is based on the concept that the brain functions in a dynamic manner, and utilizes dynamic functional connectivity graphs. The EEG data is first segmented into intervals during which functional networks sustain their connectivity. Functional connectivity networks for each identified segment are then localized, and graphs are constructed, which will be used as features. To take advantage of the dynamic nature of the generated graphs, a long short term memory classifier is employed for classification. Main results. Features extracted from various durations of post-stimulus EEG data associated with motor execution and imagery tasks are used to test the performance of the classifier. Results show an average accuracy of 85.32% about only 500 ms after stimulus presentation. Significance. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that using the proposed feature extraction method, it is possible to classify motor tasks from EEG recordings using a short interval of the data in the order of hundreds of milliseconds (e.g. 500 ms). This duration is considerably shorter than what has been reported before. These results will have significant implications for improving the effectiveness and the speed of BCIs, particularly for those used in assistive technologies.

Temporal ordering information is important to predict eye state because EEG is a time sequence dataset. In this research, we keep the temporal ordering of the data in place. We create multiple CNN network models and select optimal filters and depth. Our CNN feature models are effective on both subject dependent and subject independent eye state EEG classifications.

The variety of protocol designs and the growing interest in physiological computing require parallel improvements in processing and classification of both EEG signals and bio signals, such as electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR) or breathing. If some EEG-based analysis tools are already available for online BCIs with a number of online BCI platforms (e.g., BCI2000 or OpenViBE), it remains crucial to perform offline analyses in order to design, select, tune, validate and test algorithms before using them online. Moreover, studying and comparing those algorithms usually requires expertise in programming, signal processing and machine learning, whereas numerous BCI researchers come from other backgrounds with limited or no training in such skills. Finally, existing BCI toolboxes are focused on EEG and other brain signals but usually do not include processing tools for other bio signals. Therefore, in this paper, we describe BioPyC, a free, open-source and easy-to-use Python platform for offline EEG and biosignal processing and classification. Based on an intuitive and well-guided graphical interface, four main modules allow the user to follow the standard steps of the BCI process without any programming skills: (1) reading different neurophysiological signal data formats, (2) filtering and representing EEG and bio signals, (3) classifying them, and (4) visualizing and performing statistical tests on the results. We illustrate BioPyC use on four studies, namely classifying mental tasks, the cognitive workload, emotions and attention states from EEG signals.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are one of the ways to represent human brain activity. It has been shown, that different brain networks correspond to processes corresponding to varieties of emotional stimuli. In this paper, we demonstrate a deep learning architecture for the movie identification task from the EEG response using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset includes nine movie clips that span across different emotional states. The EEG time series data has been collected for 20 participants. Given one second EEG response of particular participant, we tried to predict its corresponding movie ID. We have also discussed the various pre-processing steps for data cleaning and data augmentation process. All the participants have been considered in both train and test data. We obtained 80.22% test accuracy for this movie classification task. We also tried cross participant testing using the same model and the performance was poor for the unseen participants. Our result gives insight toward the creation of identifiable patterns in the brain during audiovisual perception.

However, low spatial resolution is regarded as the deficiency of EEG signified from researches, which can fortunately be made up by synthetic analysis of data from different channels. In order to efficiently obtain subspace features with discriminant characteristics from EEG channel information, a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Networks (MC-CNN) model is proposed for MI-EEG decoding. Firstly input data is pre-processed form selected multi-channel signals, then the time-spatial features are extracted using a novel 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Finally, these features are transformed to discriminant sub-space of information with Auto-Encoder (AE) to guide the identification network. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-channel spatial feature extraction method has certain advantages in recognition performance and efficiency.

In this study, two sliding window techniques are proposed to enhance the binary classification of MI. The first one calculates the longest consecutive repetition (LCR) of the sequence of prediction of all the sliding windows and is named SW-LCR. The second calculates the mode of the sequence of prediction of all the sliding windows and is named SW-Mode. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is used for extracting features with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) used for classification of each time window. Both the SW-LCR and SW-Mode are applied on publicly available BCI Competition IV-2a data set of healthy individuals and on a stroke patients' data set. Compared with the existing state of the art, the SW-LCR performed better in the case of healthy individuals and SW-Mode performed better on stroke patients' data set for left- versus right-hand MI with lower standard deviation. For both the data sets, the classification accuracy (CA) was approximately 80% and kappa (kappa) was 0.6. The results show that the sliding window-based prediction of MI using SW-LCR and SW-Mode is robust against intertrial and intersession inconsistencies in the time of activation within a trial and thus can lead to a reliable performance in a neurorehabilitative BCI setting.

This work aims at exploring the capability of empirical wavelet transform in decoding the brain wave pattern acquired in response to a thought process and visual stimuli. Empirical wavelet transform (EWT), when combined with the wavelet scattering coefficients is found to efficiently decode the brain wave using recurrent neural network (RNN) based classifier. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) are the two modalities considered in this work. The proposed framework is assessed using three different RNN architectures namely long short term memory (LSTM), bi-directional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU). The experimental results show that wavelet scattering coefficients extracted from the dominant mode of EWT decomposition record better performance of 90.23 % and 84.25 % for EEG and MEG signals using GRU as classifier. Furthermore, the wavelet scattering network which involves no learning process achieves better classification at reduced time and computational complexities.	[Priya, B.

Motor-imagery (MI) classification base on electroencephalography (EEG) has been long studied in neuroscience and more recently widely used in healthcare applications such as mobile assistive robots and neurorehabilitation. In particular, EEG-based MI classification methods that rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved relatively high classification accuracy. However, naively training CNNs to classify raw EEG data from all channels, especially for high-density EEG, is computationally demanding and requires huge training sets. It often also introduces many irrelevant input features, making it difficult for the CNN to extract the informative ones. This problem is compounded by a dearth of training data, which is particularly acute for MI tasks, because these are cognitively demanding and thus fatigue inducing. Approach. To address these issues, we proposed an end-to-end CNN-based neural network with attentional mechanism together with different data augmentation (DA) techniques. We tested it on two benchmark MI datasets, brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV 2a and 2b. In addition, we collected a new dataset, recorded using high-density EEG, and containing both MI and motor execution (ME) tasks, which we share with the community. Main results. Our proposed neural-network architecture outperformed all state-of-the-art methods that we found in the literature, with and without DA, reaching an average classification accuracy of 93.6% and 87.83% on BCI 2a and 2b, respectively. We also directly compare decoding of MI and ME tasks. Focusing on MI classification, we find optimal channel configurations and the best DA techniques as well as investigate combining data across participants and the role of transfer learning. Significance. Our proposed approach improves the classification accuracy for MI in the benchmark datasets. In addition, collecting our own dataset enables us to compare MI and ME and investigate various aspects of EEG decoding critical for neuroscience and BCI.

We propose a novel approach called time-frequency common spatial patterns (TFCSP) to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification. The proposed approach decomposes the EEG signal into time stages and frequency components to find the most robust and discriminative features. Common spatial patterns (CSP) are extracted from every decomposed time-frequency cell and unreliable features are removed while remaining features are weighted and regularized for the classifi-cation. Comparison on three publicly available datasets from BCI competition III and IV shows that the proposed TFCSP outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This demonstrates that adopting subject reaction time paradigm is useful to enhance the classification performance. It also shows that the complex CSP in the frequency domain significantly effective than the commonly used bandpass-filters in time domain. Finally, this work proves that weighting and regularizing CSP features are better techniques than selecting the leading CSP features because the former alleviates information loss.

J	Narayanan, AM; Patrinos, P; Bertrand, A				Narayanan, Abhijith Mundanad; Patrinos, Panagiotis; Bertrand, Alexander			Optimal Versus Approximate Channel Selection Methods for EEG Decoding With Application to Topology-Constrained Neuro-Sensor Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Decoding; Electroencephalography; Electrodes; Topology; Iterative decoding; Scalp; Channel selection; EEG processing; EEG sensor networks; auditory attention detection; brain-computer interface	WIRELESS EEG; SPEECH	Channel selection or electrode placement for neural decoding is a commonly encountered problem in electroencephalography (EEG). Since evaluating all possible channel combinations is usually infeasible, one usually has to settle for heuristic methods or convex approximations without optimality guarantees. To date, it remains unclear how large the gap is between the selection made by these approximate methods and the truly optimal selection. The goal of this paper is to quantify this optimality gap for several state-of-the-art channel selection methods in the context of least-squares based neural decoding. To this end, we reformulate the channel selection problem as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP), which allows the use of efficient MIQP solvers to find the optimal channel combination in a feasible computation time for up to 100 candidate channels. As this reveals the exact solution to the combinatorial problem, it allows to quantify the performance losses when using state-of-the-art sub-optimal (yet faster) channel selection methods. In a context of auditory attention decoding, we find that a greedy channel selection based on the utility metric does not show a significant optimality gap compared to optimal channel selection, whereas other state-of-the-art greedy or l(1)-norm penalized methods do show a significant loss in performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MIQP formulation also provides a natural way to incorporate topology constraints in the selection, e.g., for electrode placement in neuro-sensor networks with galvanic separation constraints. Furthermore, a combination of this utility-based greedy selection with an MIQP solver allows to perform a topology constrained electrode placement, even in large scale problems with more than 100 candidate positions.

This results in certain malfunctioning of neurons that can be detected by an electroencephalogram (EEG) using several electrodes on a human skull at appropriate positions. It is of great interest to be able to classify an EEG activity as that of a normal person or an alcoholic person using data from the minimum possible electrodes (or channels). Due to the complex nature of EEG signals, accurate classification of alcoholism using only a small dataset is a challenging task. Artificial neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), provide efficient and accurate results in various pattern-based classification problems. In this work, we apply CNN on raw EEG data and demonstrate how we achieved 98% average accuracy by optimizing a baseline CNN model and outperforming its results in a range of performance evaluation metrics on the University of California at Irvine Machine Learning (UCI-ML) EEG dataset. This article explains the stepwise improvement of the baseline model using the dropout, batch normalization, and kernel regularization techniques and provides a comparison of the two models that can be beneficial for aspiring practitioners who aim to develop similar classification models in CNN. A performance comparison is also provided with other approaches using the same dataset.

In the first part of the document, we describe the economic and social implications of the disease, traditional diagnosis techniques, and the fundaments of automated AD detection. Then, we present electroencephalography (EEG) as an appropriate alternative for the early detection of AD, owing to its reduced cost, portability, and non-invasiveness. We also describe the main time and frequency domain EEG features that are employed in AD detection. Subsequently, we examine some of the main studies of the last decade that aim to provide an automatic detection of AD and its previous stages by means of SP and ML. In these studies, brain data was acquired using multiple medical techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and EEG. The main aspects of each approach, namely feature extraction, classification model, validation approach, and performance metrics, are compiled and discussed. Lastly, a set of conclusions and recommendations for future research on AD automatic detection are drawn in the final section of the paper.

However, so far, the applications of deep learning methods for the electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery classification is very limited. In this study, a pre-processing algorithm is proposed for the EEG signals representation. Then, a parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN) architecture is proposed to classify motor imagery signals. For the raw EEG signals representation, a new form of the images is created to combine spatial filtering and frequency bands extracting together. By feeding the represented images into the PCNN, it stacks three unique sub-models together aiming to optimize the performance of classification. The average accuracy of the proposed method achieves 83.0 +/- 3.4% on BCI Competition IV dataset 2b, which outperforms the compared methods at least 5.2%. The average Kappa value of the proposed method achieves 0.659 +/- 0.067 on dataset 2b, providing at least 20.5% improvement with respect to the compared algorithms. The results show that the proposed method performs better in EEG motor imagery signals classification.

Typically, artifacts such as blinking and a falling-off in user's attention caused by a long experiment period have a great effect on the small quantity and the low quality of the EEG training data. To address this problem, in this work, we introduce a novel classification method based on data augmentation method and DL framework for motor imagery (MI) EEGs classification. The proposed framework generates input EEG images with distinct MI features from a small amount of EEG training data. Experimental results using a public BCI dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the predecessors which use a simple DL model.

Features are extracted simultaneously from multiple EEG channels, rather than separately from individual channels. This helps in capturing the interrelationships between the cortical regions. To alleviate the problem of lack of enough data for training deep networks, sliding window-based data augmentation is performed. Mean phase coherence and magnitude-squared coherence, two popular measures used in EEG connectivity analysis, are used as features. These features are compactly arranged, exploiting their symmetry, to obtain a three dimensional "image-like" representation. The three dimensions of this matrix correspond to the alpha, beta and gamma EEG frequency bands. A deep network with ResNet50 as the base model is used for classifying the imagined prompts. The proposed method is tested on the publicly available ASU dataset of imagined speech EEG, comprising four different types of prompts. The accuracy of decoding the imagined prompt varies from a minimum of 79.7% for vowels to a maximum of 95.5% for short-long words across the various subjects. The accuracies obtained are better than the state-of-the-art methods, and the technique is good in decoding prompts of different complexities.

Automated detection is important for patient care and to enable research. However, training accurate detectors requires a large labeled dataset. Active Learning (AL) may help select informative examples to label, but the optimal AL approach remains unclear. Methods: We assembled >200,000 h of EEG from 1,454 hospitalized patients. From these, we collected 9,808 labeled and 120,000 unlabeled 10-second EEG segments. Labels included 6 IIIC patterns. In each AL iteration, a Dense-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) learned vector representations for EEG segments using available labels, which were used to create a 2D embedding map. Nearest-neighbor label spreading within the embedding map was used to create additional pseudo-labeled data. A second Dense-Net was trained using real- and pseudo-labels. We evaluated several strategies for selecting candidate points for experts to label next. Finally, we compared two methods for class balancing within queries: standard balanced-based querying (SBBQ), and high confidence spread-based balanced querying (HCSBBQ). Results: Our results show: 1) Label spreading increased convergence speed for AL. 2) All query criteria produced similar results to random sampling. 3) HCSBBQ query balancing performed best. Using label spreading and HCSBBQ query balancing, we were able to train models approaching expert-level performance across all pattern categories after obtaining similar to 7000 expert labels. Conclusion: Our results provide guidance regarding the use of AL to efficiently label large EEG datasets in critically ill patients.

J	Harpale, V; Bairagi, V				Harpale, Varsha; Bairagi, Vinayak			An adaptive method for feature selection and extraction for classification of epileptic EEG signal in significant states	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epilepsy; Fuzzy inference engine; Pattern adapted wavelet transform (PAWT)		Electroencephalography (EEG) is a measurement tool to measure the electrical activity of brain observed due to chemical variation in brain. The EEG analysis has important role in feature extraction and classification methods for detecting and predicting various brain diseases. Epilepsy is a major disease characterized by seizures and observed due to sudden abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. Mostly the research is carried out to classify the normal EEG signal from epileptic EEG signal. The objective of the paper is to identify pre-seizure state and seizure state of EEG signal using time and frequency features. Classifying these states of EEG signal using fuzzy classifier helps in predicting seizures. The methodology uses hypothetical testing to refine feature selection and pattern adapted wavelet transform to improve classification. The appropriate feature selection reduces computational complexity of the classifier. The artifacts are removed from the EEG signal using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The CHB-MIT EEG scalp dataset from Children's Hospital, Boston is used for experimentation.

J	Jiang, HP; Wu, DM; Jiao, R; Wang, ZN				Jiang, Huiping; Wu, Demeng; Jiao, Rui; Wang, Zongnan			Analytical Comparison of Two Emotion Classification Models Based on Convolutional Neural Networks	COMPLEXITY			English	Article								Electroencephalography (EEG) is the measurement of neuronal activity in different areas of the brain through the use of electrodes. As EEG signal technology has matured over the years, it has been applied in various methods to EEG emotion recognition, most significantly including the use of convolutional neural network (CNN). However, these methods are still not ideal, and shortcomings have been found in the results of some models of EEG feature extraction and classification. In this study, two CNN models were selected for the extraction and classification of preprocessed data, namely, common spatial patterns- (CSP-) CNN and wavelet transform- (WT-) CNN. Using the CSP-CNN, we first used the common space model to reduce dimensionality and then applied the CNN directly to extract and classify the features of the EEG; while, with the WT-CNN model, we used the wavelet transform to extract EEG features, thereafter applying the CNN for classification. The EEG classification results of these two classification models were subsequently analyzed and compared, with the average classification accuracy of the CSP-CNN model found to be 80.56%, and the average classification accuracy of the WT-CNN model measured to 86.90%. Thus, the findings of this study show that the average classification accuracy of the WT-CNN model was 6.34% higher than that of the CSP-CNN.

In this article, a novel complex network (CN) based broad learning system (CNBLS) is proposed to realize an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based fatigue detection. First, a simulated driving experiment was conducted to obtain EEG recordings in alert and fatigue state. Then, the CN theory is applied to facilitate the broad learning system (BLS) for realizing an EEG-based fatigue detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNBLS can accurately differentiate the fatigue state from an alert state with high stability. In addition, the performances of the four existing methods are compared with the results of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms these existing methods. In comparison to directly using EEG signals as the input of BLS, CNBLS can sharply improve the detection results. These results demonstrate that it is feasible to apply BLS in classifying EEG signals by means of CN theory. Also, the proposed method enriches the EEG analysis methods.

In this paper, we introduce haptic and sensory perception-based BCI systems called neurohaptics. It is a preliminary study for a variety of scenarios using actual touch and touch imagery paradigms. We designed a novel experimental environment and a device that could acquire brain signals under touching designated materials to generate natural touch and texture sensations. Through the experiment, we collected the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with respect to four different texture objects. Seven subjects were recruited for the experiment and evaluated classification performances using machine learning and deep learning approaches. Hence, we could confirm the feasibility of decoding actual touch and touch imagery on EEG signals to develop practical neurohaptics.

J	Farsi, L; Siuly, S; Kabir, E; Wang, H				Farsi, Leila; Siuly, Siuly; Kabir, Enamul; Wang, Hua			Classification of Alcoholic EEG Signals Using a Deep Learning Method	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Principal component analysis; Alcoholism; Classification algorithms; Artificial neural networks; Alcoholism; electroencephalogram (EEG); feature extraction; principal component analysis (PCA); artificial neural network (ANN); long short-term memory (LSTM) network; deep leaning method	NEUROTOXICITY; ETHANOL	Most of the traditional alcoholism detection methods are developed based on machine learning based methods that cannot extract the deep concealed characteristics of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from different layers. Hence, this study aims to introduce a deep leaning-based method that can automatically identify alcoholic EEG signals. It also explores if a hand-crafted feature extraction method is worth applying to deep learning techniques for classification of alcoholism. To investigate this, this paper presents two deep learning-based algorithms for classification of alcoholic EEG signals for comparison. In Algorithm 1, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based feature extraction technique has been applied to extract representative components and then the extracted features are used as input to Artificial neural network (ANN) for classification. In Algorithm 2, the raw EEG data are directly used as inputs to a deep learning method: 'long short-term memory (LSTM)' for detection of alcoholism. The proposed algorithms were tested on a publicly available UCI Alcoholic EEG dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed Algorithm 2 could achieve an average classification accuracy of 93% while this accuracy is 86% for the proposed Algorithm 1. The comparative evaluations with the state-of-the-art algorithms indicate that Algorithm 2 also outperforms other competing algorithms in the literature. Thus deep learning algorithm when applied to raw data, can produce better performance than the combination of the hand-crafted feature method and the deep leaning algorithm. Our proposed system can be used to determine the extent of alcoholism-related changes in EEG signals and the effectiveness of therapeutic plans.

J	Cura, OK; Akan, A				Cura, Ozlem Karabiber; Akan, Aydin			Classification of Epileptic EEG Signals Using Synchrosqueezing Transform and Machine Learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Synchrosqueezing transform (SST); electroencephalogram (EEG); epileptic seizure classification; machine learning	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; METHODOLOGY; EXTRACTION; IMAGE	Epilepsy is a neurological disease that is very common worldwide. Patient's electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for the detection of epileptic seizure segments. In this paper, a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation called Synchrosqueezing Transform (SST) is used to detect epileptic seizures. Two different EEG data sets, the IKCU data set we collected, and the publicly available CHB-MIT data set are analyzed to test the performance of the proposed model in seizure detection. The SST representations of seizure and nonseizure (pre-seizure or inter-seizure) EEG segments of epilepsy patients are calculated. Various features like higher-order joint TF (HOJ-TF) moments and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based features are calculated using the SST representation. By using single and ensemble machine learning methods such as k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Boosted Trees (BT), and Subspace kNN (S-kNN), EEG features are classified. The proposed SST-based approach achieved 95.1% ACC, 96.87% PRE, 95.54% REC values for the IKCU data set, and 95.13% ACC, 93.37% PRE, 90.30% REC values for the CHB-MIT data set in seizure detection. Results show that the proposed SST-based method utilizing novel TF features outperforms the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)-based approach, providing over 95% accuracy for most cases, and compares well with the existing methods.

Thus, there is an increasing demand for emotion analysis and recognition via EEG signals in real time. In this article, we proposed a new framework, emotion recognition-assisted deep learning framework from eeg signal (eRAD-Fe), to achieve the best recognition result from EEG signals. eRAD-Fe integrates three aspects by exploiting sliding-window segmentation method to enlarge the size of the training dataset, configuring the energy threshold-based multiclass common spatial patterns to extract the prominent features, and improving emotional state recognition performance based on a long short-term memory model. With our proposed recognitionassisted framework, the emotional classification accuracies were 82%, 72%, and 81% on three publicly available EEG datasets, such as SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER, respectively.

The performance of BCIs primarily depends on the efficacy of the feature extraction and feature selection techniques, as well as the classification algorithms employed. More often than not, high dimensional feature set contains redundant features that may degrade a given classifier's performance. In the present investigation, an ensemble learning-based classification algorithm, namely random subspace k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) has been proposed to classify the motor imagery (MI) data. The common spatial pattern (CSP) has been applied to extract the features from the MI response, and the effectiveness of random forest (RF)-based feature selection algorithm has also been investigated. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method, an experimental study has been implemented using four publicly available MI dataset (BCI Competition III dataset 1 (data-1), dataset IIIA (data-2), dataset IVA (data-3) and BCI Competition IV dataset II (data-4)). It was shown that the ensemble-based random subspace k-NN approach achieved the superior classification accuracy (CA) of 99.21%, 93.19%, 93.57% and 90.32% for data-1, data-2, data-3 and data-4, respectively against other models evaluated, namely linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, random forest, Naive Bayes and the conventional k-NN. In comparison with other classification approaches reported in the recent studies, the proposed method enhanced the accuracy by 2.09% for data-1, 1.29% for data-2, 4.95% for data-3 and 5.71% for data-4, respectively. Moreover, it is worth highlighting that the RF feature selection technique employed in the present study was able to significantly reduce the feature dimension without compromising the overall CA. The outcome from the present study implies that the proposed method may significantly enhance the accuracy of MI data classification.

J	Xu, SW; Zhu, L; Kong, WZ; Peng, Y; Hu, H; Cao, JT				Xu, Senwei; Zhu, Li; Kong, Wanzeng; Peng, Yong; Hu, Hua; Cao, Jianting			A novel classification method for EEG-based motor imagery with narrow band spatial filters and deep convolutional neural network	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Motor imagery; Narrow band; Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN); Feature fusion	PATTERNS; BCI	The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is the most widely used method for decoding Electroencephalography (EEG) signals from motor imagery (MI) paradigm. However, due to the inter-subject variability, the CSP algorithm heavily relies on the selection of filter bands and extensive analytical processing time required to build an effective model, which has been a challenge in current research. In this paper, we propose a narrow filter bank CSP (NFBCSP) algorithm, which automatically determines the optimal narrow band for two-class motor imagery by band search tree, and a high-performance classification model dedicated to each subject can be obtained in a short time for online processing or further offline analysis. The optimal narrow band is combined with the CSP algorithm to extract the dynamic features in the EEG signals. For the multi-class motor imagery task, it is first transformed into multiple One-Versus-Rest (OVR) tasks and determines the corresponding optimal narrow bands. After extracting the features of each optimal narrow band separately, the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is used for the fusion of band features and classification of multi-class motor imagery. Finally, we verified our method using two different motor imagery datasets, the BCI-VR dataset with two classes of motor imagery and the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a with four classes of motor imagery. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an average classification accuracy of 86.43% for the two-class motor imagery task, and 76.87% for the four-class motor imagery task, which outperforms other recent methods.

Improved epileptic seizure detection using singular spectrum empirical mode decomposition and machine learning approach	JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epilepsy; Machine learning classifier; Statistics; Functional analysis; Singular spectrum empirical mode decomposition (SSEMD); Wavelet transform (WT) and ANOVA analysis	CLASSIFICATION	Electroencephalography (EEG) is multi-channel electrical signal acquiring tool used to acquire the brain signals and used in various application such as neurological disorder detection and prediction, monitoring psychological condition, emotion analysis and Brain-Computer interface (BCI). Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological disorder caused by the occurrence of seizures. Epilepsy is a neurological condition of the brain where some neurons change its behaviours such as hyper-activeness and channel synchronization. The EEG signals recorded from epileptic patients are analysed for monitoring and extracting behaviour of signals during onset seizures. The Time and Frequency Domain (TFD), Wavelet Transform (WT) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) are well-proven feature extraction methods used for various applications. The objective of the paper is to propose a new effective method, Singular Spectrum Empirical Mode Decomposition (SSEMD) for effective classification of Normal and Epileptic EEG Signals. The high-performance machine learning classifiers are used for classification of EEG signal in normal and epileptic class. The performance observed with the proposed feature extraction method is 99.8 percent of detection accuracy with nearly zero false positive rates. The average dimensionality reduction of 70 percent of total feature space is observed due to the use of ANOVA.

Schizophrenia is a mental disorder which affects the functioning of brain. In this paper, we aim to determine quantitative significant EEG features which can be used to differentiate person having schizophrenia disorder and the healthy ones. Variational mode decomposition method (VMD) is used for feature extraction followed by statistical significance analysis of the extracted values. VMD is a popular decomposition method due to its adaptive nature. In this study, we also aim to examine the efficacy of the method in EEG signal analysis. Six different features were calculated and analyzed over the decomposed EEG signal. Analysis is done by performing statistical significance test on SPSS version 23 and by observing the p-values and error bar graphs. Results indicate that five out of six features turned out to be a very good indicator/markers. Hence, this method could be further extended by applying machine learning approach for the classification based on obtained feature set.

However, electroencephalography (EEG) signals evoked by motor imagery (MI) are sometimes limited in their amount due to invalid data caused by the subjects' fatigue, leading to a performance degradation. To this end, in this work we extend empirical mode decomposition into multivariate empirical mode decomposition and intrinsic time-scale decomposition, proposing a component-mixing strategy (CMS) for MI data augmentation. Compared to commonly used data augmentation methods such as generative adversarial networks, CMS can generate artificial trials from a few training samples without any required training. We claim that raw and artificial data generated by CMS are consistent with respect to the distribution and power spectral density. Experiments done on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2b show that CMS can achieve a considerable improvement on the binary classification accuracy and the area under the curve score using EEGNet, wavelet neural networks and a support vector machine.

Quantifying Signal Quality From Unimodal and Multimodal Sources: Application to EEG With Ocular and Motion Artifacts	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						signal quality; artifact detection; electroencephalography; quantitative EEG; machine learning		With prevalence of electrophysiological data collected outside of the laboratory from portable, non-invasive modalities growing at a rapid rate, the quality of these recorded data, if not adequate, could affect the effectiveness of medical devices that depend of them. In this work, we propose novel methods to evaluate electrophysiological signal quality to determine how much of the data represents the physiological source of interest. Data driven models are investigated through Bayesian decision and deep learning-based methods to score unimodal (signal and noise recorded on same device) and multimodal (signal and noise each recorded from different devices) data, respectively. We validate these methods and models on three electroencephalography (EEG) data sets (N = 60 subjects) to score EEG quality based on the presence of ocular artifacts with our unimodal method and motion artifacts with our multimodal method. Further, we apply our unimodal source method to compare the performance of two different artifact removal algorithms. Our results show we are able to effectively score EEG data using both methods and apply our method to evaluate the performance of other artifact removal algorithms that target ocular artifacts. Methods developed and validated here can be used to assess data quality and evaluate the effectiveness of certain noise-reduction algorithms.

Deep-Learning-Based Multivariate Pattern Analysis (dMVPA): A Tutorial and a Toolbox	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deep learning; cognitive neuroscience; machine learning; EEG; fMRI; neural networks; Python; MVPA		In recent years, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been hugely beneficial for cognitive neuroscience by making new experiment designs possible and by increasing the inferential power of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and other neuroimaging methodologies. In a similar time frame, "deep learning" (a term for the use of artificial neural networks with convolutional, recurrent, or similarly sophisticated architectures) has produced a parallel revolution in the field of machine learning and has been employed across a wide variety of applications. Traditional MVPA also uses a form of machine learning, but most commonly with much simpler techniques based on linear calculations; a number of studies have applied deep learning techniques to neuroimaging data, but we believe that those have barely scratched the surface of the potential deep learning holds for the field. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to deep learning for those new to the technique, explore the logistical pros and cons of using deep learning to analyze neuroimaging data - which we term "deep MVPA," or dMVPA - and introduce a new software toolbox (the "Deep Learning In Neuroimaging: Exploration, Analysis, Tools, and Education" package, DeLINEATE for short) intended to facilitate dMVPA for neuroscientists (and indeed, scientists more broadly) everywhere.

The vigilance states were induced on nine healthy subjects while performing 30 min in-congruent Stroop color-word task (I-SCWT). We measured brain activity using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals with 64-channels. We quantified the regional network connectivity using the phase-locking value (PLV) with graph theory analysis (GTA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Results showed that the vigilance decrement state was associated with impaired information processing within the frontal and central regions in delta and theta frequency bands. Meanwhile, the hemispheric asymmetry results showed that the laterality shifted to the right-temporal in delta, right-central, parietal, and left frontal in theta, right-frontal and left-central, temporal and parietal in alpha, and right-parietal and left temporal in beta frequency bands. These findings represent the first demonstration of intra-regional connectivity and hemispheric asymmetry changes as a function of cognitive vigilance states. The overall results showed that vigilance decrement is region and frequency band-specific. Our SVM model achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.73% in differentiating between the two vigilance states based on the frontal and central connectivity networks measures.

Compared to the classical approaches combined with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are primarily investigated during the past decade, the number of studies that employ Deep Learning methods on BCI applications is relatively limited. In this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive comparison between traditional classification methods and suggests the significance of Deep Learning-based BCI techniques, especially Multi-Layered Perceptron. In summary, with Electroencephalography (EEG) signals during motor imagery tasks, Support Vector Machine (SVM) showed the shortest training time and prediction speed with comparable accuracy among traditional ML-based algorithms. Notably, our subject-independent generalized MLP model succsfully classified the signals with approximate to 90% accuracy and half the classification time compared to traditional ML-based models. (1) This result suggests that this standard MLP model can become a bridging wireframe for further advanced subject-independent BCI with sophisticated optimization. (2) This result suggests the possibility of a much accurate and robust generalized BCI (subject independent) if this model integrates sophisticated optimization.

An Interpretable Machine Learning Method for the Detection of Schizophrenia Using EEG Signals	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; machine learning; random forest; schizophrenia; connectivity; direct directed transfer function; generalized partial directed coherence	CAUSAL RELATIONS; OCCIPITAL LOBE; CLASSIFICATION	In this work we propose a machine learning (ML) method to aid in the diagnosis of schizophrenia using electroencephalograms (EEGs) as input data. The computational algorithm not only yields a proposal of diagnostic but, even more importantly, it provides additional information that admits clinical interpretation. It is based on an ML model called random forest that operates on connectivity metrics extracted from the EEG signals. Specifically, we use measures of generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC) and direct directed transfer function (dDTF) to construct the input features to the ML model. The latter allows the identification of the most performance-wise relevant features which, in turn, provide some insights about EEG signals and frequency bands that are associated with schizophrenia. Our preliminary results on real data show that signals associated with the occipital region seem to play a significant role in the diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, although every frequency band might yield useful information for the diagnosis, the beta and theta (frequency) bands provide features that are ultimately more relevant for the ML classifier that we have implemented.

The public DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI databases are used. Just one EEG electrode channel is selected for the feature extraction process. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is then utilized to extract the proposed gray-scale image (GSI) feature which describes the EEG brain activation in both time and frequency domains. Finally, the new BLS is constructed for the emotion classification process, which successfully upgrades the efficiency of emotion classification based on EEG brain signals. The experiment results show that the proposed work produces a robust system with high accuracy of approximately 93.1% and training process time of approximately 0.7 s for the DEAP database, as well as, the high average accuracy of approximately 94.4% and training process time of approximately 0.6 s for MAHNOB-HCI database.

Spatial filtering is commonly used to improve the SNR yet the individual differences in the underlying temporal or frequency information is often ignored. This paper investigates motor imagery signals via orthogonal wavelet decomposition, by which the raw signals are decomposed into multiple unrelated sub-band components. Furthermore, channel-wise spectral filtering via weighting the sub-band components are implemented jointly with spatial filtering to improve the discriminability of EEG signals, with an l(2)-norm regularization term embedded in the objective function to address the underlying over-fitting issue. Finally, sparse Bayesian learning with Gaussian prior is applied to the extracted power features, yielding an RVM classifier. The classification performance of SEOWADE is significantly better than those of several competing algorithms (CSP, FBCSP, CSSP, CSSSP, and shallow ConvNet). Moreover, scalp weight maps of the spatial filters optimized by SEOWADE are more neurophysiologically meaningful. In summary, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of SEOWADE in extracting relevant spatio-temporal information for single-trial EEG classification.

Many MI EEG classification systems segment EEG into windows for classification. However, a comprehensive analysis of decision fusion based on the segmented EEG data, within the context of different classifiers, has not been carried out. This study presents a multi-segment majority voting (MSMV) decision fusion approach in which an EEG trial is segmented using overlapping windows. Segments are labelled and a final classification label for the trial is derived through majority voting, using the common spatial pattern (CSP) features. The impact of the MSMV approach on the classification accuracy of six classifiers was investigated. The effects of window size and overlap were analysed. Results were generated using five different subsets of EEG channels, and channel subsets for static EEG analysis are also proposed. The BCI Competition III dataset IVa was used. The MSMV decision fusion approach was found to significantly improve the classification accuracy for linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), naive-Bayes (NB) and random forest (RF) classifiers. The classification accuracy was improved by 5.02%, 4.41%, 1.25% and 3.62% for the SVM, LDA, NB and RF classifiers, respectively. The channel analysis indicated the importance of central-parietal and central-frontal electrode regions for MI EEG classification. MSMV decision fusion improved MI EEG classification performance and could be considered for future studies, particularly in online systems that deal with buffered data.

Although accurate, this method comes at a high cost of invasive surgery and experts trained to score EEG/EMG data. Here, we leverage modern computer vision methods to directly classify sleep substages from video data. This bypasses the need for surgery and expert scoring, provides a path to high-throughput studies of sleep in mice. Methods We collected synchronized high-resolution video and EEG/EMG data in 16 male C57BL/6J mice. We extracted features from the video that are time and frequency-based and used the human expert-scored EEG/EMG data to train a visual classifier. We investigated several classifiers and data augmentation methods. Results Our visual sleep classifier proved to be highly accurate in classifying wake, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) states, and achieves an overall accuracy of 0.92 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD). We discover and genetically validate video features that correlate with breathing rates, and show low and high variability in NREM and REM sleep, respectively. Finally, we apply our methods to noninvasively detect that sleep stage disturbances induced by amphetamine administration. Conclusions We conclude that machine learning-based visual classification of sleep is a viable alternative to EEG/EMG based scoring. Our results will enable noninvasive high-throughput sleep studies and will greatly reduce the barrier to screening mutant mice for abnormalities in sleep.

Presently, there is no cure for AD. Developing a convenient method of screening for AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) could enable early intervention, thus slowing down the progress of the disease and enabling better overall disease management. Methods: In the current study, resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data were acquired from 113 normal cognition (NC) subjects, 116 amnestic MCI patients, and 72 probable AD patients. After preprocessing by an automatic algorithm, features including spectral power, complexity, and functional connectivity were extracted, and machine-learning classifiers were built to differentiate among the 3 groups. The classification performance was evaluated from multiple perspectives, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals, and compared to the empirical chance level by permutation tests. Results: The analysis of variance results (P<0.05 with false discovery rate correction) confirmed the tendency to slow brain activity, reduced complexity, and connectivity with AD progress. By combining the features, the ability of the machine-learning classifiers, especially the ensemble trees, to differentiate among the 3 groups, was significantly better than that of the empirical chance level of the permutation test. The AUC of the classifier with the best performance was 80.08% for AD vs. NC, 70.82% for AD vs. MCI, and 63.95% for MCI vs. NC. Conclusions: The current study presented a fully automatic procedure that could significantly distinguish NC, MCI, and AD subjects via resting-state EEG signals. The study was based on a large data set with evidence-based medical diagnosis and provided further evidence that resting-state EEG data could assist in the discrimination of AD patients.

Recently, there has been increasing work on using neural networks to classify individuals with concussion using electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, to date the need for research grade equipment has limited the applications to clinical environments. We recently developed a deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network to classify concussion using raw, resting state data using 64 EEG channels and achieved high accuracy in classifying concussion. Here, we report on our efforts to develop a clinically practical system using a minimal subset of EEG sensors. EEG data from 23 athletes who had suffered a sport-related concussion and 35 non-concussed, control athletes were used for this study. We tested and ranked each of the original 64 channels based on its contribution toward the concussion classification performed by the original LSTM network. The top scoring channels were used to train and test a network with the same architecture as the previously trained network. We found that with only six of the top scoring channels the classifier identified concussions with an accuracy of 94%. These results show that it is possible to classify concussion using raw, resting state data from a small number of EEG sensors, constituting a first step toward developing portable, easy to use EEG systems that can be used in a clinical setting.

People with normal hearing perform remarkably well in such situations. Analysis of the cortical signals using electroencephalography (EEG) has revealed that the EEG signals track the envelope of the attended speech stronger than that of the interfering speech. This has enabled the development of algorithms that can decode the selective attention of a listener in controlled experimental settings. However, often these algorithms require longer trial duration and computationally expensive calibration to obtain a reliable inference of attention. In this paper, we present a novel framework to decode the attention of a listener within trial durations of the order of two seconds. It comprises of three modules: 1) Dynamic estimation of the temporal response functions (TRF) in every trial using a sequential linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator, 2) Extract the N1-P2 peak of the estimated TRF that serves as a marker related to the attentional state, and 3) Obtain a probabilistic measure of the attentional state using a support vector machine followed by a logistic regression. The efficacy of the proposed decoding framework was evaluated using EEG data collected from 27 subjects. The total number of electrodes required to infer the attention was four: One for the signal estimation, one for the noise estimation and the other two being the reference and the ground electrodes. Our results make further progress towards the realization of neurosteered hearing aids.

We analyze the potential predictive performance of event-related potential analysis in this high gamma band, provide evidence that detection algorithms should take into account the varying strength of a patient's common frequency extremes, and provide evidence that patient-specific approaches to machine learning algorithms may be more successful in the detection of pediatric seizures as they are more difficult to detect than adult seizures. Using these results, machine learning detection algorithm performance on pediatric patient data, which is prone to issues from limitations within the algorithms, may be significantly improved by incorporating high gamma band signal processing at the locations identified by this process.

Stress is traditionally measured using questionnaires with the help of psychologists. Due to shortage of health facilities and stigma associated with mental checkup, stress measurement process needs to be automated. This paper presents the results of an experiment to predict the perceived stress scores from electroencephalography (EEG) using a linear regression model. EEG signals are recorded using a five channel EEG headband for a duration of three minutes, with dry electrodes. In the first step, we acquire data by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire and in the second step, we record EEG using muse headband and apply linear regression algorithm. The values of the PSS score serve as ground truth, which is then predicted by linear regression model. From the results, it is shown that the value of root mean squared error is as low as 2.36. This shows that PSS scores can be predicted with considerable accuracy by applying linear regression model on EEG signals. Our research suggests that perceived stress can be estimated from EEG signals using a low-channel headset once the system is trained.

J	Gao, M; Mao, J				Gao, Ming; Mao, Jie			A Novel Active Rehabilitation Model for Stroke Patients Using Electroencephalography Signals and Deep Learning Technology	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						stroke; rehabilitation model; deep learning technology; deep neural network model; EEG recognition	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; EEG; RISK	The main clinical manifestations of stroke are motor, language, sensory, and mental disorders. After treatment, in addition to being conscious, other symptoms will still remain in varying degrees. This is the sequelae of stroke, including numbness, facial paralysis, central paralysis, and central paralysis. If the sequelae of stroke are not treated effectively, they can easily develop into permanent sequelae. Most of the affected people have sequelae, and most of them have symptoms of upper limb paralysis. Therefore, it is of great significance to study how to carry out effective rehabilitation training for stroke patients to reduce the disease and even restore their motor function. Based on this background, this research aims to use deep learning technology to design a stroke rehabilitation model based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. First, the patient's EEG signal will be preprocessed. Then, an improved deep neural network model (IDNN) is used to get the EEG classification results. The traditional DNN model construction process is simple and suitable for scenarios where there is no special requirement for the data format, but the generalization of a single DNN model is usually poor. Large margin support vector machine (LM_SVM) is an extension method of support vector machine (SVM), suitable for any occasion. By optimizing the edge distribution, better generalization performance can be obtained. Taking into account the advantages of DNN and LM_SVM and the high aliasing characteristics of stroke data, an improved DNN model is proposed. Finally, based on the EEG recognition result of the model, the rehabilitation equipment is controlled to assist the patient in rehabilitation treatment. The experimental results verify the superiority of the EEG classification model used, and further prove that this research has good practical value.</p>	[Gao, Ming] Wuhan Sports Univ, Coll Sports Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Mao, Jie] Wuhan Sports Univ, Coll Sports Engn & Informat Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China		Mao, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Sports Univ, Coll Sports Engn & Informat Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.	maojie@whsu.edu.cn		Mao, Jie/0000-0002-7244-4749	Scientific Research Program of Education Department of Hubei Province, China [D20184101]; Higher Education Reform Project of Hubei Province, China [201707]; East Lake Scholar of Wuhan Sports University Fund, China; Hubei Provincial University Specialty subject group construction Special fund, China	Scientific Research Program of Education Department of Hubei Province, China; Higher Education Reform Project of Hubei Province, China; East Lake Scholar of Wuhan Sports University Fund, China; Hubei Provincial University Specialty subject group construction Special fund, China	This work was supported by the Scientific Research Program of Education Department of Hubei Province, China (D20184101), Higher Education Reform Project of Hubei Province, China (201707), East Lake Scholar of Wuhan Sports University Fund, China, and Hubei Provincial University Specialty subject group construction Special fund, China.		32	5	5	7	8	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		1662-453X		FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ	Front.

Sleep disorders are medical disorders of a subject's sleep architecture and based on their severity, they can interfere with mental, emotional and physical functioning. The most common ones are insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, bruxism, etc. There is an increased risk of developing sleep disorders in elderly like insomnia, periodic leg movements, rapid eye movement behavior disorders, sleep disorder breathing, etc. Consequently, their accurate diagnosis and classification are important steps towards an early stage treatment that could save the life of a patient. Approach. The electroencephalographic (EEG) signal is the most sensitive and important biosignal, which is able to capture the brain sleep activity that is sensitive to sleep. In this study, we attempt to analyze EEG sleep activity via complementary cross-frequency coupling (CFC) estimates, which further feed a classifier, aiming to discriminate sleep disorders. We adopted an open EEG database with recordings that were grouped into seven sleep disorders and a healthy control. The EEG brain activity from common sensors has been analyzed with two basic types of CFC. Main results. Finally, a random forest (RF) classification model was built on CFC patterns, which were extracted from non-cyclic alternating pattern epochs. Our RFCFC model achieved a 74% multiclass accuracy. Both types of CFC, phase-to-amplitude and amplitude-amplitude coupling patterns contribute to the accuracy of the RF model, thus supporting their complementary information. Significance. CFC patterns, in conjunction with the RF classifier proved a valuable biomarker for the classification of sleep disorders.

Due to the availability of multiple learning options, evaluating each option and judging the best use case plays a vital role. One of the most important characteristics that a human brain utilizes during process of learning is cognition that involves attention and retention. Student's attention span and situational interests during learning have always been a subject matter of research. Apart from classroom learning, e-learning (MOOC based learning) is the other most preferred way of learning. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess attention levels of a learner in MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) learning environments and compare it with conventional classroom learning using brain signals. The proposed method captures electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands of different subjects while going through a short lecture in MOOC/e-learning environment and classroom environment. The captured data points were annotated for attentiveness manually by referring to the subject's feedback and video clips. Machine learning classification model of support vector machines (SVM) was used to classify student's mental state as attentive or nonattentive. Promising results were obtained and experiments revealed that higher attention levels were maintained during MOOC learning environment in comparison to traditional learning approach.

We test HemCNN's decoding capabilities to decode in a streaming way the hand, left or right, from fNIRS data. HemCNN learned to detect which hand executed a grasp at a naturalistic hand action speed of 1 Hz, outperforming standard methods. Since HemCNN does not require baseline correction and the convolution operation is invariant to time translations, our method can help to unlock fNIRS for a variety of real-time tasks. Mobile brain imaging and mobile brain machine interfacing can benefit from this to develop real-world neuroscience and practical human neural interfacing based on BOLD-like signals for the evaluation, assistance and rehabilitation of force generation, such as fusion of fNIRS with EEG signals.

The proposed method takes the standard common spatial pattern (CSP) filter as an input and produces an optimal electrode set as output for effective classification of different cognitive tasks. The standard CSP algorithms are highly prone to the inclusion of noise in the EEG data and may select noisy electrodes/signal sources that are redundant for a specific cognitive task which, in turn, may lead to a lower classification accuracy. A lot of literature exists in this area of research, most of which deals with adding the regularization term in the standard CSP algorithm. However, all of these methods lack capturing the uncertainty present in the EEG responses due to intrasession and intersession variations of subjective brain response. The novelty of this article lies in designing the fuzzy signaling game-based approach for optimal electrode selection using an interval type-2 fuzzy set, which can capture both the intrasession and intersession variability of EEG responses acquired from a subject's scalp. Experiments are undertaken over a wide variety of possible cognitive task classification problems which reveal that the proposed method yields superior results in electrode selection with respect to classification accuracy. Statistical tests undertaken using the Friedman test also confirm the superiority of the proposed method over its competitors.

The electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used for motor imagery based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) due to non-invasive, cost-effective, and portable manner. For the analysis of the EEG signals, there are several machine learning and deep learning methods. However, the majority of those methods have limitations of not considering the distinct frequency bands for subject-specific manner. Therefore, we propose the method that pays attention to the significant frequency bands for each subject and also extracts the spatio-temporal-spectral features simultaneously. We utilize filter bank, sliding window segmentation, and the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract the spatio-temporal features with consideration of multiple frequency bands. Then, we employ the sub-band attention to determine the significant information of each frequency band. Finally, the attention-based Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is implemented to extract the temporal dynamic features. Our proposed method is evaluated on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset by using two classes in the subject-specific manner. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is effective to focus on the significant frequency band for each subject.

This study aims to quantify EEG features to understand task-induced neurological declines due to stroke and evaluate the biomarkers to distinguish the ischemic stroke group and the healthy adult group. We investigated forty-eight stroke patients (average age 72.2 years, 62% male) admitted to the rehabilitation center and seventy-five healthy adults (average age 77 years, 31% male) with no history of known neurological diseases. EEG was recorded through frontal, central, temporal, and occipital cortical electrodes (Fz, C1, C2, T7, T8, Oz) using wireless EEG devices and a newly developed data acquisition platform within three months after the appearance of symptoms of ischemic stroke (clinically confirmed). Continuous EEG data were recorded during the consecutive resting, motor (walking and working activities), and cognitive reading tasks. The statistical results showed that alpha, theta, and delta activities are biomarkers classifying the stroke patients and the healthy adults in the motor and cognitive states. DAR and DTR of the stroke group differed significantly from those of the healthy control group during the resting, motor, and cognitive tasks. Using the machine-learning approach, the C5.0 model showed 78% accuracy for the resting state, 89% accuracy in the functional motor walking condition, 84% accuracy in the working condition, and 85% accuracy in the cognitive reading state for classification the stroke group and the control group. This study is expected to be helpful for post-stroke treatment and post-stroke recovery.

The traditional methods employ some representative features while losing too much information. Deep learning methods have achieved good results, but subject to the insufficient ability of extracting discriminative features from EEG. In this paper, we propose a novel decoding framework that effectively uses spatial and temporal information by time-contained spatial filtering and spatial-temporal analysis network (TSF-STAN) for EEG multi-classification tasks. Firstly, the TSF with the joint oneversus-rest (Joint-OVR) strategy is given to map the signal to a new space, where each category can be more easily distinguished, while preserving the time-domain characteristics. Next, the STAN is designed to extract discriminative spatial and temporal features further with convolutional layers, and then perform classification. Detailed experiments have been carried out to verify the effectiveness of our framework on BCI competition IV2a and IV-2b datasets of motor imagery (MI) EEG. The results show that our method has outperformed recent outstanding algorithms, with the average accuracy of 83.0% on IV-2a and 88.0% on IV-2b. Spatial and temporal information is well used to obtain better performance, which has a good potential of EEG decoding for application of BCI.

Recently, various deep learning-based methods have been proposed to improve the performance of P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) for BCI. However, during the detection of P300 ERP signals, even electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the same person are inconsistent and may be significantly distorted, resulting in impaired classification accuracy in many deep learning methods. Here, we propose a machine learning model based on a one-dimensional convolutional capsule network (1D-CapsNet). This network topology can effectively detect P300 ERP signals in the time domain, thereby achieving a better detection performance than can the current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods. Two classifiers based on the 1D-CapsNet model are proposed, namely, 1D-CapsNet-64 and 1D-CapsNet-8, which are used for classifying EEG data with 64 and 8 electrodes, respectively. These two classifiers are tested and compared on dataset II of the third BCI competition. The results show that the 1D-CapsNet-64 classifier obtains the best character recognition rate result (96%). The proposed method is superior to both state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and various traditional machine learning methods. The experimental results reveal the feasibility of our proposed method for detecting P300 ERP signals. The proposed method is expected to expand the concept of EEG signal recognition pattern and improve BCI design and applications.

EEG patterns are generated through electrical activity over the human scalp, but the collected data from these sensors are quite complex due to noise and artifacts. Given the complex nature of human brain signals, emotion recognition and regulation are still challenging problems. By emphasizing and aiming to improve the human living, how could be possible to prevent emotional or behavioral disorder in children in their early age? Therefore, it is essential to investigate the children's emotions. In this study, we present a mechanism to regulate children's emotions. Over 40 subjects' EEG data were collected and performed a late-positive-potential (LPP) analysis in EEGLAB. By investigating late positive potential during emotion regulatory analysis, we find a significant difference in modulation and amplitude between control/special subjects that may help in early detection of mood disruption problems.

J	Huang, CX; Xiao, YT; Xu, GW				Huang, Chenxi; Xiao, Yutian; Xu, Gaowei			Predicting Human Intention-Behavior Through EEG Signal Analysis Using Multi-Scale CNN	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Task analysis; Time-frequency analysis; Pattern classification; Image segmentation; Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification; human intention-behavior; short time fourier transform (STFT); multi-scale convolutional neural networks	CLASSIFICATION; COHERENCE	At present, the application of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification to human intention-behavior prediction has become a hot topic in the brain computer interface (BCI) research field. In recent studies, the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN) has contributed to substantial improvements in the EEG signal classification performance. However, there is still a key challenge with the existing CNN-based EEG signal classification methods, the accuracy of them is not very satisfying. This is because most of the existing methods only utilize the feature maps in the last layer of CNN for EEG signal classification, which might miss some local and detailed information for accurate classification. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-scale CNN model-based EEG signal classification method. In this method, first, the EEG signals are preprocessed and converted to time-frequency images using the short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) technique. Then, a multi-scale CNN model is designed for EEG signal classification, which takes the converted time-frequency image as the input. Especially, in the designed multi-scale CNN model, both the local and global information is taken into consideration. The performance of the proposed method is verified on the benchmark data set 2b used in the BCI contest IV. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed method is 73.9 percent, which improves the classification accuracy of 10.4, 5.5, 16.2 percent compared with the traditional methods including artificial neural network, support vector machine, and stacked auto-encoder.

The electromagnetic signals are generated inside the brain due to a mental or physical task performed. These signals excite a bunch of neurons within a particular lobe depending upon the nature of the task performed. To localize this activity, certain machine learning (ML) techniques in conjunction with a neuroimaging technique (M/EEG, fMRI, PET) are developed. Different ML techniques are provided in the literature for brain source localization. Among them, the most common are: minimum norm estimation (MNE), low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and Bayesian framework based multiple sparse priors (MSP). Aims: In this research work, EEG is used as a neuroimaging technique. Methods: EEG data is synthetically generated at SNR=5dB. Afterwards, ML techniques are applied to estimate the active sources. Each dataset is run for multiple trials (>40). The performance is analyzed using free energy and localization error as performance indicators. Furthermore, MSP is applied with a variant number of patches to observe the impact of patches on source localization. Results: It is observed that with an increased number of patches, the sources are localized with more precision and accuracy as expressed in terms of free energy and localization error, respectively. Conclusion: The patches optimization within the Bayesian Framework produces improved results in terms of free energy and localization error.

The main clinical characteristic of depression is significant and persistent low mood. As reported, depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Moreover, the rate of recognition and treatment for depression is low. Therefore, the detection and treatment of depression are urgent. Multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which reflect the working status of the human brain, can be used to develop an objective and promising tool for augmenting the clinical effects in the diagnosis and detection of depression. However, when a large number of EEG channels are acquired, the information redundancy and computational complexity of the EEG signals increase; thus, effective channel selection algorithms are required not only for machine learning feasibility, but also for practicality in clinical depression detection. Consequently, we propose an optimal channel selection method for EEG-based depression detection via kernel-target alignment (KTA) to effectively resolve the abovementioned issues. In this method, we consider a modified version KTA that can measure the similarity between the kernel matrix for channel selection and the target matrix as an objective function and optimize the objective function by a proposed optimal channel selection strategy. Experimental results on two EEG datasets show that channel selection can effectively increase the classification performance and that even if we rely only on a small subset of channels, the results are still acceptable.

They often cause critical problems especially in medical and healthcare application since they can lead to incorrect diagnosis or even cause system failure. Many of recent imputation techniques have adopted machine learning-based generative methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) to deal with missing values in medical data. They are, however, incapable of reproducing realistic time-series signals preserving important latent features such as sleep stages that are important context in many medical applications using electroencephalogram (EEG). In this study, we propose a novel GAN-based technique generating realistic EEG signal sequences which are not only shown natural but also correctly classified with sleep stages by implanting the latent features in the synthetic sequence. By experiments, we confirm that our model generates not only more realistic EEG signals than a recent GAN-based model but also preserve auxiliary information such as sleep stages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing machine learning methods based on EEG data still work well without sacrificing performance using the imputed data by using our method.

These limitations lead to continuous interests of researchers and clinicians toward the automatic sleep stages classification of EEG signals. This paper proposes a scheme for automatic classification of sleep stages using edge strength of visibility graph technique from single-channel EEG signals. To discover the validity of the proposed study with noise, we perform simulation analysis with two different time series named Lorenz and Rossler time series. The proposed technique accomplishes better performance than other related work for the two standard groups of sleep stages: Rechtschaffen and Kales standard and American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

This work proposes a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic EEG data. Another objective of our study is to use transfer-learning (TL) for evaluating the performance of four well-known deep-learning (DL) models to predict epileptic seizure. Methods: We proposed an algorithm that generate synthetic data using DCGAN trained on real EEG data in a patient-specific manner. We validate quality of generated data using one-class SVM and a new proposal namely convolutional epileptic seizure predictor (CESP). We evaluate performance of VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3 trained on augmented data using TL with average time of 10 min between true prediction and seizure onset samples. Results: The CESP model achieves sensitivity of 78.11% and 88.21%, and false prediction rate of 0.27/h and 0.14/h for training on synthesized and testing on real Epilepsyecosystem and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Using TL and augmented data, Inceptionv3 achieved highest accuracy with sensitivity of 90.03% and 0.03 FPR/h. With the proposed data augmentation method prediction results of CESP model and Inceptionv3 increased by 4-5% as compared to state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. Conclusion: The performance of CESP shows that synthetic data acquired association between features and labels very well and by using the augmented data CESP predicted better than chance level for both datasets. Significance: The proposed DCGAN can be used to generate synthetic data to increase the prediction performance and to overcome good quality data scarcity issue.

Rajendra			Automated Identification of Sleep Disorder Types Using Triplet Half-Band Filter and Ensemble Machine Learning Techniques with EEG Signals	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						sleep; sleep stages; polysomnography (PSG); classification; ensemble boosted trees	WAVELET; BEHAVIOR; QUESTIONNAIRE; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES; DISEASE; DESIGN	A sleep disorder is a medical condition that affects an individual's regular sleeping pattern and routine, hence negatively affecting the individual's health. The traditional procedures of identifying sleep disorders by clinicians involve questionnaires and polysomnography (PSG), which are subjective, time-consuming, and inconvenient. Hence, an automated sleep disorder identification is required to overcome these limitations. In the proposed study, we have proposed a method using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for the automated identification of six sleep disorders, namely insomnia, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE), narcolepsy, rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD), periodic leg movement disorder (PLM), and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). To the best of our belief, this is one of the first studies ever undertaken to identify sleep disorders using EEG signals employing cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) sleep database. After sleep-scoring EEG epochs, we have created eight different data subsets of EEG epochs to develop the proposed model. A novel optimal triplet half-band filter bank (THFB) is used to obtain the subbands of EEG signals. We have extracted Hjorth parameters from subbands of EEG epochs. The selected features are fed to various supervised machine learning algorithms for the automated classification of sleep disorders. Our proposed system has obtained the highest accuracy of 99.2%, 98.2%, 96.2%, 98.3%, 98.8%, and 98.8% for insomnia, narcolepsy, NFLE, PLM, RBD, and SDB classes against normal healthy subjects, respectively, applying ensemble boosted trees classifier. As a result, we have attained the highest accuracy of 91.3% to identify the type of sleep disorder. The proposed method is simple, fast, efficient, and may reduce the challenges faced by medical practitioners during the diagnosis of various sleep disorders accurately in less time at sleep clinics and homes.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are one of the most widely used for such BCI systems. Over the past decade or so, electrooculography (EOG) signals have shown tremendous potential to complement EEG based BCI systems. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of a hybrid BCI system, combining the EEG and EOG signals, for remotely controlling a vehicle, such as a wheelchair, using machine learning technique. Motor Imagery (MI) EEG signals and EOG signals are combined to design this robust and computationally faster system. The proposed system is trained and tested on 13 in-house subject's data and it is able to achieve an average accuracy of 87.3%, where, 3 of the subjects produced more than 90% accuracy.

The combination of VR with electroencephalography (EEG) presents further opportunities to improve therapeutic efficacy by personalizing the paradigm. Specifically, the idea is to synchronize the choice and timing of stimuli in the perceived virtual world with fluctuating brain states relevant to motor behavior. Here, we present an open source EEG single-trial based classification pipeline that is designed to identify ongoing brain states predictive of the planning and execution of movements. 9 healthy volunteers each performed 1080 trials of a repetitive reaching task with an implicit two-alternative forced choice, i.e., use of the right or left hand, in response to the appearance of a visual target. The performance of the EEG decoding pipeline was assessed with respect to classification accuracy of right vs. left arm use, based on the EEG signal at the time of the stimulus. Different features, feature extraction methods, and classifiers were compared at different time windows; the number and location of informative EEG channels and the number of calibration trials needed were also quantified, as well as any benefits from individual-level optimization of pipeline parameters. This resulted in a set of recommended parameters that achieved an average 83.3% correct prediction on never-before-seen testing data, and a state-of-the-art 77.1% in a real-time simulation. Neurophysiological plausibility of the resulting classifiers was assessed by time-frequency and event-related potential analyses, as well as by Independent Component Analysis topographies and cortical source localization. We expect that this pipeline will facilitate the identification of relevant brain states as prospective therapeutic targets in closed-loop EEG-VR motor neurorehabilitation.

This paper presents EEC-based machine learning models involving 30 healthy subjects and 33 major depressive disorder (MDD) subjects to diagnose MDD. The model with the best performance has been evaluated on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework for smart healthcare. The main idea behind this study is to recognize features and classifiers which can best discriminate the healthy and depressive subjects. This study has three main steps of analysis: 1) Linear, non-linear, fractal dimension, statistical, time, coherence features have been extracted from EEG signals. Their effects are investigated, and quality features are identified. 2) Three feature selection methods, Principle component analysis (PCA), Neighbourhood component analysis (NBA), and Relief-based algorithm (RBA), are utilized for the selection of most relevant features, and their performance is compared. 3) For discriminating normal and depressed subjects, radial-basis function (RBF) based support vector machine (SVM), K- nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes classification (NBC), bagged tree (BT) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier are used. This paper concludes that non-linear features with an RBF-SVM classifier achieve the best classification accuracy of 98.90%. The findings in this study are utilized to develop a model to detect depression in remote applications and smart healthcare.

However, the time costs of human experts are very high, and the examination of EEGs by such experts, therefore, accounts for a plethora of medical resources. In this study, an improved one-dimensional CNN-only system of 25 layers has been proposed to identify abnormal and normal adult EEG signals using a single EEG montage without using any explicit feature extraction technique. Most of the previous systems based on deep learning, that have been proposed to solve this problem, use extremely deep architectures containing very large numbers of layers. This study also presents an independent preprocessing module that has been exhaustively evaluated for optimal parameters with the target of adult EEG signal classification. The achieved accuracy of the proposed classifier as a part of the decision support system is 82.24%, which is a substantial improvement of similar to 3% over the previous best reported classifier of comparable depth. The system also exhibits significantly higher F1-score and sensitivity as well as lower loss. The proposed system is intended to be a part of an expert system for overall brain health evaluation.

Twenty-one participants wore an OpenBCI headset and JINS MEME eyewear while playing the Whack-a-Mole game at three levels of difficulty. We used a variety of classifiers [i.e., a support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and ensemble classifier (EC)] to classify the participants' emotional states based on their EEG, EOG, and kinematic motion data. The classifiers were trained using the International Affective Picture System (LAPS). The EC and RF showed the best results in terms of their overall performance. Using tenfold cross-validation for all the subjects, the accuracies obtained were 73% for Arousal and 80% for Valence. Our results suggest that EEG and EOG biosignals, as well as kinematic motion data acquired using off-the-shelf wearable sensors in combination with machine-learning techniques such as EC, can be used to classify emotional states, while the individuals were playing the Whack-a-Mole game.

The primary attempts of BCI research are to decoding human speech from brain signals, implementing creativity by imagination, and controlling neuro-psychological patterns by utilizing billion of neural activities that would significantly benefit people suffering from neurological disorders. In this study, we illustrate the progress of BCI research and present scores of unveiled contemporary approaches. First, we explore a decoding natural speech approach that is designed to decode human speech directly from the human brain onto a digital screen introduced by Facebook Reality Lab and University of California San Francisco. Then, we study a recently presented visionary project to control the human brain using Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI) approach. We also investigate well-known electroencephalography (EEG) based Emotiv Epoc+ Neuroheadset to identify six emotional parameters including engagement, excitement, focus, stress, relaxation, and interest using brain signals by experimenting the neuroheadset among three human subjects where we utilize two two supervised learning classifiers, Naive Bayes and Linear Regression to show the accuracy and competency of the Epoc+ device and its associated applications in neurotechnological research. We present experimental studies and the demonstration indicates 69 % and 62 % improved accuracy for the aforementioned classifiers respectively in reading the performance matrices of the participants. We envision that non-invasive, insertable, and low-cost BCI approaches shall be the focal point for not only an alternative for patients with physical paralysis but also understanding the brain that would pave us to access and control the memories and brain somewhere very near.

Individualized real-time prediction of working memory performance by classifying electroencephalography signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; event-related (de-)synchronization; N-back; single-trial classification; working memory	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; RIGHT FOOT MOVEMENTS; OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; TASK; SELECTION; LOAD	An individualized model that predicts trial-by-trial working memory performance is instrumental for personalized interventions. Here, we propose a single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) classification process predicting individuals' responses, that is, target correct versus target non-correct during a working memory task, N-back. We used event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD and ERS) prior to an anticipatory cue as features. The proposed comprehensive process addresses single-trial EEG classification challenges such as temporal overlap between training and testing datasets, feature selection's stability, and significance of the classification accuracy which have been often overlooked. Our model identified for the first time a few (ranged between 4 and 10) brain regions and oscillations where ERD and ERS predicted an individual's performance. Mean (SD) prediction accuracy across 50 participants (mean age [SD] = 28.56 [7.55]) was 69.51% (8.41). Accuracy was significantly above chance in 34 participants. This machine learning-based approach provides a proof of principle for individualizing EEG targets for potential interventions.

The system collects EEG signals using an eight-electrode placement on the scalp; two of these electrodes were placed in the frontal lobe, and the other six electrodes were placed in the temporal lobe. We performed experiments on eight subjects while they watched emotive videos. Six entropy measures were employed for extracting suitable features from the EEG signals. Next, we evaluated our proposed models using three popular classifiers: a support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for emotion classification; both subject-dependent and subject-independent strategies were used. Our experiment results showed that the highest average accuracies achieved in the subject-dependent and subject-independent cases were 85.81% and 78.52%, respectively; these accuracies were achieved using a combination of the sample entropy measure and 1D-CNN. Moreover, our study investigates the T8 position (above the right ear) in the temporal lobe as the most critical channel among the proposed measurement positions for emotion classification through electrode selection. Our results prove the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed EEG-based affective computing method for emotion recognition in real-world applications.

In this paper, we explore the multimodal prediction of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Analyses were carried out on a dataset comprised of EEG and MRI data collected from 89 patients diagnosed with minimal-mild AD. Three feature selection algorithms were assessed alongside four machine learning algorithms. Results showed that while MRI features alone outperformed EEG features, when both modalities were combined, improved results were achieved. The top-selected EEG features conveyed information about amplitude modulation rate-of-change, whereas top-MRI features comprised information about cortical area and white matter volume. Overall, a root mean square error between predicted MMSE values and true MMSE scores of 1.682 was achieved with a multimodal system and a random forest regression model.

J	Yang, L; Song, YH; Ma, K; Xie, LH				Yang, Lie; Song, Yonghao; Ma, Ke; Xie, Longhan			Motor Imagery EEG Decoding Method Based on a Discriminative Feature Learning Strategy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Decoding; Feature extraction; Task analysis; Classification algorithms; Deep learning; Data mining; Motor imagery electroencephalograph (EEG) decoding; central distance loss (CD-loss); central vector shift; central vector update; circular translation strategy	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; CONNECTIVITY	With the rapid development of deep learning, more and more deep learning-based motor imagery electroencephalograph (EEG) decoding methods have emerged in recent years. However, the existing deep learning-based methods usually only adopt the constraint of classification loss, which hardly obtains the features with high discrimination and limits the improvement of EEG decoding accuracy. In this paper, a discriminative feature learning strategy is proposed to improve the discrimination of features, which includes the central distance loss (CD-loss), the central vector shift strategy, and the central vector update process. First, the CD-loss is proposed to make the same class of samples converge to the corresponding central vector. Then, the central vector shift strategy extends the distance between different classes of samples in the feature space. Finally, the central vector update process is adopted to avoid the non-convergence of CD-loss and weaken the influence of the initial value of central vectors on the final results. In addition, overfitting is another severe challenge for deep learning-based EEG decoding methods. To deal with this problem, a data augmentation method based on circular translation strategy is proposed to expand the experimental datasets without introducing any extra noise or losing any information of the original data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct some experiments on two public motor imagery EEG datasets (BCI competition IV 2a and 2b dataset), respectively. The comparison with current state-of-the-art methods indicates that our method achieves the highest average accuracy and good stability on the two experimental datasets.

Machine learning for automated EEG-based biomarkers of cognitive impairment during Deep Brain Stimulation screening in patients with Parkinson?s Disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Machine learning; Quantitative EEG; Parkinson?s Disease; Deep Brain Stimulation; Cognition	DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; FLUCTUATIONS; DENSITY; MEMORY; SCALE	Objective: A downside of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's Disease (PD) is that cognitive function may deteriorate postoperatively. Electroencephalography (EEG) was explored as biomarker of cognition using a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline. Methods: A fully automated ML pipeline was applied to 112 PD patients, taking EEG time-series as input and predicted class-labels as output. The most extreme cognitive scores were selected for class differentiation, i.e. best vs. worst cognitive performance (n = 20 per group). 16,674 features were extracted per patient; feature-selection was performed using a Boruta algorithm. A random forest classifier was modelled; 10-fold cross-validation with Bayesian optimization was performed to ensure generalizability. The predicted class-probabilities of the entire cohort were compared to actual cognitive performance. Results: Both groups were differentiated with a mean accuracy of 0.92; using only occipital peak frequency yielded an accuracy of 0.67. Class-probabilities and actual cognitive performance were negatively linearly correlated (b =-0.23 (95% confidence interval (-0.29,-0.18))). Conclusions: Particularly high accuracies were achieved using a compound of automatically extracted EEG biomarkers to classify PD patients according to cognition, rather than a single spectral EEG feature.

A systematic mapping of feature extraction and feature selection methods of electroencephalogram signals for neurological diseases diagnostic assistance	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Visualization; Systematics; IEEE transactions; Neurological diseases; Monitoring; Diagnosis; EEG; electroencephalogram; feature extraction; feature selection; neural disease	EPILEPTIC SEIZURE DETECTION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION METHODS; AUTOMATIC DETECTION; EEG CLASSIFICATION; BINARY PATTERNS; MODEL	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive tool used to monitor the electrical activities of the brain. EEG signal analysis has several applications in the medical field. It is widely used for clinical diagnostics and for advances in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) area. In recent years, several studies about the automatic execution of this analysis have been proposed, motivated by the fact that the visual inspection demands a long time from an expert, besides being subject to a misdiagnosis. In order to extract and select relevant information from recordings of brain electrical activity, many computerized analysis methods have been developed based on different approaches. Although some proposed methods have achieved good performance, many of them are not suitable for real-world application due to their high computational cost. Thus, there is opportunity in the area to identify and categorize techniques in order to support studies about the influence of these techniques on diagnostic performance and to propose the optimization of this task. In this context, this Systematic Mapping evaluates the 144 primary studies identified according to the criteria defined in the protocol. The purpose is to highlight which neurological disorders have been studied in recent years and which techniques for feature extraction and feature selection have been applied during signal analysis, individually or jointly, to provide specifically an automatic diagnosis of a neurological disorder using a classifier.

Most existing research relies on experts' cognitive prediction, and studies based on machine learning and deep learning are either data-hungry or not well generalizable to new subjects. In this paper, we propose a robust, data-efficient model for distinguishing tinnitus from the healthy state based on EEG-based tinnitus neurofeedback. We propose trend descriptor, a feature extractor with lower fineness, to reduce the effect of electrode noises on EEG signals, and a siamese encoder-decoder network boosted in a supervised manner to learn accurate alignment and to acquire high-quality transferable mappings across subjects and EEG signal channels. Our experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms when analyzing subjects' EEG neurofeedback to 90dB and 100dB sound, achieving an accuracy of 91.67%-94.44% in predicting tinnitus and control subjects in a subject-independent setting. Our ablation studies on mixed subjects and parameters show the method's stability in performance.

The analysis of electroencephalography signals has gained notoriety in studying human emotions because of its non-invasive nature. This paper presents a two-stage deep learning model to recognize emotional states by correlating facial expressions and brain signals. Most of the works related to the analysis of emotional states are based on analyzing large segments of signals, generally as long as the evoked potential lasts, which could cause many other phenomena to be involved in the recognition process. Unlike with other phenomena, such as epilepsy, there is no clearly defined marker of when an event begins or ends. The novelty of the proposed model resides in the use of facial expressions as markers to improve the recognition process. This work uses a facial emotion recognition technique (FER) to create identifiers each time an emotional response is detected and uses them to extract segments of electroencephalography (EEG) records that a priori will be considered relevant for the analysis. The proposed model was tested on the DEAP dataset.

Moreover, the spectral characteristics of cortical activity showed significant differences in different walking conditions. However, whether brain connectivity presents a significant difference during rats walking under different behavior conditions has yet to be verified. Similarly, whether brain connectivity can be used in locomotion detection remains unknown. To address those concerns, we recorded locomotion and implanted electroencephalography signals in freely moving rats performing two kinds of task conditions (upslope and downslope walking). The Granger causality method was used to determine brain functional directed connectivity in rats during these processes. Machine learning algorithms were then used to categorize the two walking states, based on functional directed connectivity. We found significant differences in brain functional directed connectivity varied between upslope and downslope walking. Moreover, locomotion detection based on brain connectivity achieved the highest accuracy (91.45%), sensitivity (90.93%), specificity (91.3%), and F1-score (91.43%). Specifically, the classification results indicated that connectivity features in the high gamma band contained the most discriminative information with respect to locomotion detection in rats, with the support vector machine classifier exhibiting the most efficient performance. Our study not only suggests that brain functional directed connectivity in rats showed significant differences in various behavioral contexts but also proposed a method for classifying the locomotion states of rat walking, based on brain functional directed connectivity. These findings elucidate the characteristics of neural information interaction between various cortical areas in freely walking rats.

This study aims to improve the BCI performance by integrating electroencephalographic and cerebral hemodynamic patterns. Sixteen volunteers participated in a seven-session motor imagery (MI) based visual-haptic neurofeedback training (NFT) experiment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals were synchronously recorded during the transient NFT. Time-frequency and topology analysis demonstrated that repetitive and continuous visual-haptic NFT conditions could induce an enhancement on cortical activations. Additionally, a classifier calibration strategy was proposed by integrating both the EEG and NIRS information into a strong classifier. The results revealed that the classifier constructed on integrating EEG and NIRS patterns was significantly superior to that only with independent information, achieving similar to 14% and 5% improvement respectively and reaching 84.5% in mean classification accuracy. Therefore, integrating EEG and NIRS patterns is an effective classifier calibration strategy to improve the MI-BCI performance, and could also be applied to other BCI paradigms.

This paper proposes the acquisition and processing of surface Electromyography (sEMG) on the facial muscles activated during the process of speaking and Electroencephalography (EEG), synchronized in time by means of an audio file. Data was collected in seven healthy volunteers and seven patients with dysarthria at the Physiotherapy Department of the Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital. The main objective is to classify the biosignals for verbal commands established by Support Vector Machine (SVM) method for the sEMG and Naive Bayes (NB) method for the EEG. Both methods were compared with the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method. Extracted features of sEMG signal were: standard deviation, arithmetic mean, skewness, kurtosis and RMS. For the EEG signal, characteristics were extracted in frequency domain such as: minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation, and skewness and kurtosis, in the time domain. As part of the processing method, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filters were employed in order to increase the discriminating activity between motion classes in the EEG signal. Mental task identification in healthy and dysarthric subjects reached an accuracy of 77.6-80.8%.

Predicting subclinical psychotic-like experiences on a continuum using machine learning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Schizotypy; Schizophrenia; Psychosis; Mismatch negativity; Regularity learning	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HIGH-RISK; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; SCHIZOTYPY; N100; VALIDATION; REGRESSION; PATTERNS; MODEL	Previous studies applying machine learning methods to psychosis have primarily been concerned with the binary classification of chronic schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. The aim of this study was to use elec-troencephalographic (EEG) data and pattern recognition to predict subclinical psychotic-like experiences on a continuum between these two extremes in otherwise healthy people. We applied two different approaches to an auditory oddball regularity learning task obtained from N = 73 participants: A feature extraction and selection routine incorporating behavioural measures, event-related potential compo-nents and effective connectivity parameters; Regularisation of spatiotemporal maps of event-related potentials. Using the latter approach, optimal performance was achieved using the response to frequent, predictable sounds. Features within the P50 and P200 time windows had the greatest contribution toward lower Prodromal Ques-tionnaire (PQ) scores and the N100 time window contributed most to higher PQ scores. As a proof-of-concept, these findings demonstrate that EEG data alone are predictive of individual psychotic-like experiences in healthy people. Our findings are in keeping with the mounting evidence for altered sensory responses in schizophrenia, as well as the notion that psychosis may exist on a continuum expanding into the non-clinical population.

Auditory oddball P300 have been found to be one of the most consistent markers of schizophrenia. The goal of this study is to find quantitative features that can objectively distinguish patients with schizophrenia (SCZs) from healthy controls (HCs) based on their recorded auditory odd-ball P300 electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Methods: Using EEG dataset, we develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm to distinguish 57 SCZs from 66 HCs. The proposed ML algorithm has three steps. In the first step, a brain source localization (BSL) procedure using the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming approach is employed on EEG signals to extract source waveforms from 30 specified brain regions. In the second step, a method for estimating effective connectivity, referred to as symbolic transfer entropy (STE), is applied to the source waveforms. In the third step the ML algorithm is applied to the STE connectivity matrix to determine whether a set of features can be found that successfully discriminate SCZ from HC. Results: The findings revealed that the SCZs have significantly higher effective connectivity compared to HCs and the selected STE features could achieve an accuracy of 92.68%, with a sensitivity of 92.98% and specificity of 92.42%. Conclusion: The findings imply that the extracted features are from the regions that are mainly affected by SCZ and can be used to distinguish SCZs from HCs. Significance: The proposed ML algorithm may prove to be a promising tool for the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.

EEG spectra have been analyzed with explainable machine learning and deep learning methods. However, as deep learning has developed, many studies have used raw EEG data, which is poorly suited for traditional explainability methods. Several studies have introduced methods for spectral insight into classifiers trained on raw EEG data. These studies have provided global insight into the frequency bands important to a classifier but not local insight into the frequency bands important to the classification of individual samples. Local explainability could be particularly helpful for EEG domains like sleep stage classification that feature multiple evolving states. We present a novel local spectral explainability approach and use it to explain a convolutional neural network trained for automated sleep stage classification. We use our approach to show how the importance of frequency bands varies over time and even within the same sleep stages. Also, to better understand how our approach compares to existing methods, we compare a global estimate of spectral importance generated from our local results with an existing global spectral importance approach. We find that the delta band is most important for most sleep stages, though beta is most important for the non-rapid eye movement 2 (NREM2) sleep stage. Additionally, theta is particularly important for identifying Awake and NREMI samples. Our study represents the first approach developed for local spectral insight into deep learning classifiers trained on raw EEG time series.

In this paper, we propose a new framework, which includes two parts, feature extraction and classification. Based on local mean decomposition (LMD), cloud model, and common spatial pattern (CSP), a feature extraction method called LMD-CSP is proposed to extract distinguishable features. In order to improve the classification results multi objective grey wolf optimization twin support vector machine (MOGWO-TWSVM) is applied to discriminate the extracted features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed framework on our laboratory data sets with three motor imagery (MI) tasks of the same joint (shoulder abduction, extension, and flexion), and the average classification accuracy was 91.27%. Further comparison with several widely used methods showed that the proposed method had better performance in feature extraction and pattern classification. Overall, this study can be used for developing highperformance BCI systems, enabling individuals to control external devices intuitively and naturally.

A neurophysiological approach to spatial filter selection for adaptive brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain&#8211; computer interface; EEG; sensorimotor rhythms; common spatial patterns	MOTOR-IMAGERY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; IDENTIFICATION; COMPONENTS; ARTIFACTS	Objective. The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is an effective method to extract discriminatory features from electroencephalography (EEG) to be used by a brain-computer interface (BCI). However, informed selection of CSP filters typically requires oversight from a BCI expert to accept or reject filters based on the neurophysiological plausibility of their activation patterns. Our goal was to identify, analyze and automatically classify prototypical CSP patterns to enhance the prediction of motor imagery states in a BCI. Approach. A data-driven approach that used four publicly available EEG datasets was adopted. Cluster analysis revealed recurring, visually similar CSP patterns and a convolutional neural network was developed to distinguish between established CSP pattern classes. Furthermore, adaptive spatial filtering schemes that utilize the categorization of CSP patterns were proposed and evaluated. Main results. Classes of common neurophysiologically probable and improbable CSP patterns were established. Analysis of the relationship between these categories of CSP patterns and classification performance revealed discarding neurophysiologically improbable filters can decrease decoder performance. Further analysis revealed that the spatial orientation of EEG modulations can evolve over time, and that the features extracted from the original CSP filters can become inseparable. Importantly, it was shown through a novel adaptive CSP technique that adaptation in response to these emerging patterns can restore feature separability. Significance. These findings highlight the importance of considering and reporting on spatial filter activation patterns in both online and offline studies. They also emphasize to researchers in the field the importance of spatial filter adaptation in BCI decoder design, particularly for online studies with a focus on training users to develop stable and suitable brain patterns.

One of the primary reasons for traffic accidents is driver fatigue, which can be identified by using EEG signals. This work aims to achieve a highly accurate and straightforward process to detect driving fatigue by using EEG signals. Two main problems, which are feature generation and feature selection, are defined to achieve this aim. This work solves these problems by using two different approaches. Deep networks are efficient feature generators and extract features in low, medium, and high levels. These features can be generated by using multileveled or multilayered feature extraction. Therefore, we proposed a multileveled feature generator that uses a one-dimensional binary pattern (BP) and statistical features together, and levels are created using a one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (1D-DWT). A five-level fused feature extractor is presented by using BP, statistical features of 1D-DWT together. Moreover, a 2-layered feature selection method is proposed using ReliefF and iterative neighborhood component analysis (RFINCA) to solve the feature selection problem. The goals of the RFINCA are to choose the optimal number of features automatically and use the effectiveness of ReliefF and neighborhood component analysis (NCA) together. A driving fatigue EEG dataset was used as a testbed to denote the effectiveness of eighteen conventional classifiers. According to the experimental results, a highly accurate EEG classification approach is presented. The proposed method also reached 100.0% classification accuracy by using a k-nearest neighborhood classifier.

Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is a very important tool to detect brain disorders. Neonatal seizure detection is a known, challenging problem. Under-resourced communities across the globe are particularly affected by the cost associated with EEG analysis and interpretation. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been successfully utilized to automate seizure detection in neonatal EEG, in order to assist a healthcare professional in visual analysis. Several usage scenarios are reviewed in this study. It is shown that both sonification and ML can be efficiently implemented on low-power edge platforms without any loss of accuracy. The developed platform can be easily expanded to address EEG analysis applications in neonatal and adult population.

This study investigates the efficacy of electroencephalography (EEG) centered around the user's ears (ear-EEG) for a speech-imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. Approach. A wearable ear-EEG acquisition tool was developed and its performance was directly compared to that of a conventional 32-channel scalp-EEG setup in a multi-class speech imagery classification task. Riemannian tangent space projections of EEG covariance matrices were used as input features to a multi-layer extreme learning machine classifier. Ten subjects participated in an experiment consisting of six sessions spanning three days. The experiment involves imagining four speech commands ('Left,' 'Right,' 'Forward,' and 'Go back') and staying in a rest condition. Main results. The classification accuracy of our system is significantly above the chance level (20%). The classification result averaged across all ten subjects is 38.2% and 43.1% with a maximum (max) of 43.8% and 55.0% for ear-EEG and scalp-EEG, respectively. According to an analysis of variance, seven out of ten subjects show no significant difference between the performance of ear-EEG and scalp-EEG. Significance. To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the performance of ear-EEG in a speech-imagery-based BCI. The results indicate that ear-EEG has great potential as an alternative to the scalp-EEG acquisition method for speech-imagery monitoring. We believe that the merits and feasibility of both speech imagery and ear-EEG acquisition in the proposed system will accelerate the development of the BCI system for daily-life use.

J	Zhou, J; Zhang, XT; Jiang, ZB				Zhou, Jie; Zhang, Xiongtao; Jiang, Zhibin			Recognition of Imbalanced Epileptic EEG Signals by a Graph-Based Extreme Learning Machine	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; APPROXIMATE; NETWORKS; ELM	Epileptic EEG signal recognition is an important method for epilepsy detection. In essence, epileptic EEG signal recognition is a typical imbalanced classification task. However, traditional machine learning methods used for imbalanced epileptic EEG signal recognition face many challenges: (1) traditional machine learning methods often ignore the imbalance of epileptic EEG signals, which leads to misclassification of positive samples and may cause serious consequences and (2) the existing imbalanced classification methods ignore the interrelationship between samples, resulting in poor classification performance. To overcome these challenges, a graph-based extreme learning machine method (G-ELM) is proposed for imbalanced epileptic EEG signal recognition. The proposed method uses graph theory to construct a relationship graph of samples according to data distribution. Then, a model combining the relationship graph and ELM is constructed; it inherits the rapid learning and good generalization capabilities of ELM and improves the classification performance. Experiments on a real imbalanced epileptic EEG dataset demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.

J	Zhao, H; Zheng, QQ; Ma, K; Li, HQ; Zheng, YF				Zhao, He; Zheng, Qingqing; Ma, Kai; Li, Huiqi; Zheng, Yefeng			Deep Representation-Based Domain Adaptation for Nonstationary EEG Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Electroencephalography; Brain modeling; Adaptation models; Task analysis; Data mining; Data models; Cross subject; deep neural network (DNN); domain adaptation; electroencephalography (EEG); motor imagery (MI)	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; COMPUTER; FILTERS	In the context of motor imagery, electroencephalography (EEG) data vary from subject to subject such that the performance of a classifier trained on data of multiple subjects from a specific domain typically degrades when applied to a different subject. While collecting enough samples from each subject would address this issue, it is often too time-consuming and impractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end deep domain adaptation method to improve the classification performance on a single subject (target domain) by taking the useful information from multiple subjects (source domain) into consideration. Especially, the proposed method jointly optimizes three modules, including a feature extractor, a classifier, and a domain discriminator. The feature extractor learns the discriminative latent features by mapping the raw EEG signals into a deep representation space. A center loss is further employed to constrain an invariant feature space and reduce the intrasubject nonstationarity. Furthermore, the domain discriminator matches the feature distribution shift between source and target domains by an adversarial learning strategy. Finally, based on the consistent deep features from both domains, the classifier is able to leverage the information from the source domain and accurately predict the label in the target domain at the test time. To evaluate our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two real public EEG data sets, data set IIa, and data set IIb of brain-computer interface (BCI) Competition IV. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our method. Therefore, our method is promising to reduce the calibration time for the use of BCI and promote the development of BCI.

The goal of this study was to compare an envelope-based (i.e. Amplitude Envelope Correlation, AEC) and a phase-based (i.e. weighted Phase Lag Index, wPLI) measure of FC in their classification of states of consciousness. Nine healthy participants underwent a three-hour experimental anesthetic protocol with propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance, in which five minutes of 128-channel electroencephalography were recorded before, during, and after anestheticinduced unconsciousness, at the following time points: Baseline; light sedation with propofol (Light Sedation); deep unconsciousness following three hours of surgical levels of anesthesia with isoflurane (Unconscious); five minutes prior to the recovery of consciousness (Pre-ROC); and three hours following the recovery of consciousness (Recovery). Support vector machine classification was applied to the source-localized EEG in the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency band in order to investigate the ability of AEC and wPLI (separately and together) to discriminate i) the four states from Baseline; ii) Unconscious ("deep" unconsciousness) vs. Pre-ROC ("light" unconsciousness); and iii) responsiveness (Baseline, Light Sedation, Recovery) vs. unresponsiveness (Unconscious, Pre-ROC). AEC and wPLI yielded different patterns of global connectivity across states of consciousness, with AEC showing the strongest network connectivity during the Unconscious epoch, and wPLI showing the strongest connectivity during full consciousness (i.e., Baseline and Recovery). Both measures also demonstrated differential predictive contributions across participants and used different brain regions for classification. AEC showed higher classification accuracy overall, particularly for distinguishing anesthetic-induced unconsciousness from Baseline (83.7 +/- 0.8%). AEC also showed stronger classification accuracy than wPLI when distinguishing Unconscious from Pre-ROC (i.e., "deep" from "light" unconsciousness) (AEC: 66.3 +/- 1.2%; wPLI: 56.2 +/- 1.3%), and when distinguishing between responsiveness and unresponsiveness (AEC: 76.0 +/- 1.3%; wPLI: 63.6 +/- 1.8%). Classification accuracy was not improved compared to AEC when both AEC and wPLI were combined. This analysis of source-localized EEG data demonstrates that envelope- and phase-based FC provide different information about states of consciousness but that, on a group level, AEC is better able to detect relative alterations in brain FC across levels of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness compared to wPLI.

Prediction of patient survival following postanoxic coma using EEG data and clinical features	2021 43RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE, Elsevier, Inst Engn & Technol				Electroencephalography (EEG) is an effective and non-invasive technique commonly used to monitor brain activity and assist in outcome prediction for comatose patients post cardiac arrest. EEG data may demonstrate patterns associated with poor neurological outcome for patients with hypoxic injury. Thus, both quantitative EEG (qEEG) and clinical data contain prognostic information for patient outcome. In this study we use machine learning (ML) techniques, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) to classify patient outcome post cardiac arrest using qEEG and clinical feature sets, individually and combined. Our ML experiments show RF and SVM perform better using the joint feature set. In addition, we extend our work by implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on time-frequency images derived from EEG to compare with our qEEG ML models. The results demonstrate significant performance improvement in outcome prediction using non-feature based CNN compared to our feature based ML models. Implementation of ML and DL methods in clinical practice have the potential to improve reliability of traditional qualitative assessments for postanoxic coma patients.

A wide variety of research has been done, which demonstrated the utility of audio, imagery, and electroencephalography (EEG) data for automatic emotion recognition. This paper presents a new automated emotion recognition framework, which utilizes electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The proposed method is lightweight, and it consists of four major phases, which include: a reprocessing phase, a feature extraction phase, a feature dimension reduction phase, and a classification phase. A discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) based noise reduction method, which is hereby named multi scale principal component analysis (MSPCA), is utilized during the pre-processing phase, where a Symlets-4 filter is utilized for noise reduction. A tunable Q wavelet transform (TQWT) is utilized as feature extractor. Six different statistical methods are used for dimension reduction. In the classification step, rotation forest ensemble (RFE) classifier is utilized with different classification algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and four different types of the decision tree (DT) algorithms. The proposed framework achieves over 93 % classification accuracy with RFE + SVM. The results clearly show that the proposed TQWT and RFE based emotion recognition framework is an effective approach for emotion recognition using EEG signals.

J	Shim, M; Lee, SH; Hwang, HJ				Shim, Miseon; Lee, Seung-Hwan; Hwang, Han-Jeong			Inflated prediction accuracy of neuropsychiatric biomarkers caused by data leakage in feature selection	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EEG; BIAS	In recent years, machine learning techniques have been frequently applied to uncovering neuropsychiatric biomarkers with the aim of accurately diagnosing neuropsychiatric diseases and predicting treatment prognosis. However, many studies did not perform cross validation (CV) when using machine learning techniques, or others performed CV in an incorrect manner, leading to significantly biased results due to overfitting problem. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of CV on the prediction performance of neuropsychiatric biomarkers, in particular, for feature selection performed with high-dimensional features. To this end, we evaluated prediction performances using both simulation data and actual electroencephalography (EEG) data. The overall prediction accuracies of the feature selection method performed outside of CV were considerably higher than those of the feature selection method performed within CV for both the simulation and actual EEG data. The differences between the prediction accuracies of the two feature selection approaches can be thought of as the amount of overfitting due to selection bias. Our results indicate the importance of correctly using CV to avoid biased results of prediction performance of neuropsychiatric biomarkers.

As the top three causes of death worldwide are all related to chronic disease, the importance of healthcare is increasing even more. Models that can predict real-time health conditions and diseases using various healthcare services are attracting increasing attention. Most diagnosis and prediction methods of stroke for the elderly involve imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is difficult to rapidly and accurately diagnose and predict stroke diseases due to the long testing times and high costs associated with MRI. Thus, in this paper, we design and implement a health monitoring system that can predict the precursors of stroke diseases in the elderly in real time during daily walking. First, raw electroencephalography (EEG) data from six channels were preprocessed via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The raw EEG power values were then extracted from the raw spectra: alpha (alpha), beta (beta), gamma (gamma), delta (delta), and theta (theta) as well as the low beta, high beta, and theta to beta ratio, respectively. The experiments in this paper confirm that the important features of EEG biometric signals alone during walking can accurately determine stroke precursors and occurrence in the elderly with more than 90% accuracy. Further, the Random Forest algorithm with quartiles and Z-score normalization validates the clinical significance and performance of the system proposed in this paper with a 92.51% stroke prediction accuracy. The proposed system can be implemented at a low cost, and it can be applied for early disease detection and prediction using the precursor symptoms of real-time stroke. Furthermore, it is expected that it will be able to detect other diseases such as cancer and heart disease in the future.

Emerging evidence suggests that although patients may not respond behaviorally to external stimuli during anesthesia, they may be aware of their surroundings. In this work, we investigated whether EEG based brain decoding could be used for detecting connected consciousness in the absence of behavioral responses during propofol infusion. A total of 14 subjects participated in our experiment. Subjects were asked to discriminate two types of auditory stimuli with a finger press during an ultraslow propofol infusion. We trained an EEG based brain decoding model using data collected in the awakened state using the same auditory stimuli and tested the model on data collected during the propofol infusion. The model provided a correct classification rate (CCR) of 78.74 +/- 11.15% when subjects were able to respond to the stimuli during the propofol infusion. The CCR dropped to 67.29 +/- 8.21% when subjects ceased responding and further decreased to 58.11 +/- 8.15% when we increased the propofol concentration by another 0.2 mu g/ml. After terminating the propofol infusion, we observed that the CCR rebounded to 65.31 +/- 7.11% before the subjects regained consciousness. With the classification results, we provided evidence that loss of consciousness is a gradual process and may progress from full consciousness to connected consciousness and then to disconnected consciousness.

J	Singanamalla, SKR; Lin, CT				Singanamalla, Sai Kalyan Ranga; Lin, Chin-Teng			Spiking Neural Network for Augmenting Electroencephalographic Data for Brain Computer Interfaces	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						spiking neural network; electroencephalography; brain computer interface; motor imagery; data augmentation		With the advent of advanced machine learning methods, the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has improved unprecedentedly. However, electroencephalography (EEG), a commonly used brain imaging method for BCI, is characterized by a tedious experimental setup, frequent data loss due to artifacts, and is time consuming for bulk trial recordings to take advantage of the capabilities of deep learning classifiers. Some studies have tried to address this issue by generating artificial EEG signals. However, a few of these methods are limited in retaining the prominent features or biomarker of the signal. And, other deep learning-based generative methods require a huge number of samples for training, and a majority of these models can handle data augmentation of one category or class of data at any training session. Therefore, there exists a necessity for a generative model that can generate synthetic EEG samples with as few available trials as possible and generate multi-class while retaining the biomarker of the signal. Since EEG signal represents an accumulation of action potentials from neuronal populations beneath the scalp surface and as spiking neural network (SNN), a biologically closer artificial neural network, communicates via spiking behavior, we propose an SNN-based approach using surrogate-gradient descent learning to reconstruct and generate multi-class artificial EEG signals from just a few original samples. The network was employed for augmenting motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) data. These artificial data are further validated through classification and correlation metrics to assess its resemblance with original data and in-turn enhanced the MI classification performance.

Previous emotion recognition methods almost ignored the correlation and interaction among multichannel EEG signals, which may provide salient information related to emotional states. This article proposes a novel approach based on rearranged EEG features and deep learning algorithm. In particular, each channel EEG signal is first processed in time domain to get time-domain features. Then, features of all channels are treated as a three-dimensional (3D) feature matrix, according to positions of electrode sensors. This makes the features closer to the real response of the cerebral cortex. Subsequently, an advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) designed with univariate convolution layer and multivariate convolution layer is employed to deal with the 3D feature matrix for emotion recognition. A benchmark dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signal is employed to evaluate this method. The experimental results proved that the 3D feature matrix can effectively represent the emotion-related features in multichannel EEG signals and the proposed CNN can efficaciously mine the unique features of each channel and the correlation among channels for emotion recognition.

Emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is still a challenging task in the context of developing an individual-independent recognition method. In our paper, from the perspective of spatial topology and temporal information of brain emotional patterns in an EEG, we exploit complex networks to characterize EEG signals to effectively extract EEG information for emotion recognition. First, we exploit visibility graphs to construct complex networks from EEG signals. Then, two kinds of network entropy measures (nodal degree entropy and clustering coefficient entropy) are calculated. By applying the AUC method, the effective features are input into the SVM classifier to perform emotion recognition across subjects. The experiment results showed that, for the EEG signals of 62 channels, the features of 18 channels selected by AUC were significant (p < 0.005). For the classification of positive and negative emotions, the average recognition rate was 87.26%; for the classification of positive, negative, and neutral emotions, the average recognition rate was 68.44%. Our method improves mean accuracy by an average of 2.28% compared with other existing methods. Our results fully demonstrate that a more accurate recognition of emotional EEG signals can be achieved relative to the available relevant studies, indicating that our method can provide more generalizability in practical use.

There is thus a need to design long-term reliable BCIs that can be used outside-of-the-lab by end-users, e.g., severely motor-impaired ones. Therefore, we propose and evaluate the design of a multi-class Mental Task (MT)-based BCI for longitudinal training (20 sessions over 3 months) of a tetraplegic user for the CYBATHLON BCI series 2019. In this BCI championship, tetraplegic pilots are mentally driving a virtual car in a racing video game. We aimed at combining a progressive user MT-BCI training with a newly designed machine learning pipeline based on adaptive Riemannian classifiers shown to be promising for real-life applications. We followed a two step training process: the first 11 sessions served to train the user to control a 2-class MT-BCI by performing either two cognitive tasks (REST and MENTAL SUBTRACTION) or two motor-imagery tasks (LEFT-HAND and RIGHT-HAND). The second training step (9 remaining sessions) applied an adaptive, session-independent Riemannian classifier that combined all 4 MT classes used before. Moreover, as our Riemannian classifier was incrementally updated in an unsupervised way it would capture both within and between-session non-stationarity. Experimental evidences confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Namely, the classification accuracy improved by about 30% at the end of the training compared to initial sessions. We also studied the neural correlates of this performance improvement. Using a newly proposed BCI user learning metric, we could show our user learned to improve his BCI control by producing EEG signals matching increasingly more the BCI classifier training data distribution, rather than by improving his EEG class discrimination. However, the resulting improvement was effective only on synchronous (cue-based) BCI and it did not translate into improved CYBATHLON BCI game performances. For the sake of overcoming this in the future, we unveil possible reasons for these limited gaming performances and identify a number of promising future research directions. Importantly, we also report on the evolution of the user's neurophysiological patterns and user experience throughout the BCI training and competition.

Since eye movements and electroencephalography (EEG) signals as the features of eye and brain activities have complex patterns, we utilized fractal theory and sample entropy to decode the correlation between them. In the experiment, subjects looked at a dot that moved on different random paths (dynamic visual stimuli) on the screen of a computer in front of them while we recorded their EEG signals and eye movements simultaneously. The results indicated that the changes in the complexity of eye movements and EEG signals are coupled (r = -0.8043 in case of fractal dimension and r = -0.9259 in case of sample entropy), which reflects the coupling between the brain and eye activities. This analysis could be extended to evaluate the correlation between the activities of other organs versus the brain.

EEG functional connectivity contributes to outcome prediction of postanoxic coma	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG functional connectivity; Machine learning; Postanoxic coma; Intensive care; Outcome prediction	CARDIAC-ARREST; PROGNOSTICATION; RESUSCITATION; PATTERNS; DAMAGE	Objective: To investigate the additional value of EEG functional connectivity features, in addition to non-coupling EEG features, for outcome prediction of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Methods: Prospective, multicenter cohort study. Coherence, phase locking value, and mutual information were calculated in 19-channel EEGs at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after cardiac arrest. Three sets of machine learning classification models were trained and validated with functional connectivity, EEG non-coupling features, and a combination of these. Neurological outcome was assessed at six months and cat-egorized as "good" (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] 1-2) or "poor" (CPC 3-5). Results: We included 594 patients (46% good outcome). A sensitivity of 51% (95% CI: 34-56%) at 100% specificity in predicting poor outcome was achieved by the best functional connectivity-based classifier at 12 h after cardiac arrest, while the best non-coupling-based model reached a sensitivity of 32% (0-54%) at 100% specificity using data at 12 h and 48 h. Combination of both sets of features achieved a sensitivity of 73% (50-77%) at 100% specificity. Conclusion: Functional connectivity measures improve EEG based prediction models for poor outcome of postanoxic coma. Significance: Functional connectivity features derived from early EEG hold potential to improve outcome prediction of coma after cardiac arrest.

An EEG channel selection method for motor imagery based brain-computer interface and neurofeedback using Granger causality	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Motor imagery (MI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); EEG channel selection; Granger causality; Neurofeedback; Brain-computer interface (BCI)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS; CONNECTIVITY	Motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) and neurofeedback (NF) with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are commonly used for motor function improvement in healthy subjects and to restore neurological functions in stroke patients. Generally, in order to decrease noisy and redundant information in unrelated EEG channels, channel selection methods are used which provide feasible BCI and NF implementations with better performances. Our assumption is that there are causal interactions between the channels of EEG signal in MI tasks that are repeated in different trials of a BCI and NF experiment. Therefore, a novel method for EEG channel selection is proposed which is based on Granger causality (GC) analysis. Additionally, the machine-learning approach is used to cluster independent component analysis (ICA) components of the EEG signal into artifact and normal EEG clusters. After channel selection, using the common spatial pattern (CSP) and regularized CSP (RCSP), features are extracted and with the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers, MI tasks are classified into left and right hand MI. The goal of this study is to achieve a method resulting in lower EEG channels with higher classification performance in MI-based BCI and NF by causal constraint. The proposed method based on GC, with only eight selected channels, results in 93.03% accuracy, 92.93% sensitivity, and 93.12% specificity, with RCSP feature extractor and best classifier for each subject, after being applied on Physionet MI dataset, which is increased by 3.95%, 3.73%, and 4.13%, in comparison with correlation-based channel selection method.

Because the collected EEG is a type of nonstationary signal with strong randomness, effective feature extraction and data mining techniques are urgently required for EEG classification of BCI. In this paper, the new bionic whale optimization algorithms (WOA) are proposed to promote the improved extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms for EEG classification of BCI. Two improved WOA-ELM algorithms are designed to compensate for the deficiency of random weight initialization for basic ELM. Firstly, the top several best individuals are selected and voted to make decisions to avoid misjudgment on the best individual. Secondly, the initial connection weights and bias between the input layer nodes and hidden layer nodes are optimized by WOA through bubble-net attacking strategy (BNAS) and shrinking encircling mechanism (SEM), and different regularization mechanisms are introduced in different layers to generate appropriate sparse weight matrix to promote the generalization performance of the algorithm.As shown in the contrast results, the average accuracy of the proposed method can reach 93.67%, which is better than other methods on BCI dataset.

The high-precision classification of MI is a challenging task in which the process of feature extraction is crucial step. In this work, we propose a tensor model of a dynamic brain functional network (DBFN) to decode motion intentions. First, we construct the brain functional network in each small window. Then, the BFN of each time window is superimposed into a DBFN tensor with time as the axis. A tensor decomposition method with orthogonal and partial symmetric constraints is used to analyze the DBFN. Finally, the core tensor features are used as an input of the extreme learning machine (ELM) for classification. The results show that the proposed method is better than the degree, clustering coefficient of network, and principal component analysis of DBFN matrix model and the average accuracies are improved by 17.33%, 12.91%, and 17.5% under ELM, respectively. Moreover, the classification accuracy of the proposed method has the lowest variance, i.e., 5.96, indicating that the core tensor features are more adaptable to the subjects. The proposed method has the highest accuracy of 95% under both ELM and support vector machine (SVM). The average accuracy rates of ELM and SVM are 87.08% and 85.83%, respectively. The proposed method effectively extracts the EEG signal characteristics of MI and has strong robustness. This provides a reference for further research on the feature extraction algorithm of BCI.

Thirty-four participants completed a self-reported measure of dialectical thinking, and their resting-state electroencephalography was recorded. After wave filtration and eye movement removal, time-frequency electroencephalography signals were converted into four frequency domains: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz). Functional principal component analysis with B-spline approximation was then applied for feature reduction. Five machine learning methods (support vector regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boosting decision tree) were applied to the reduced features for prediction. The model ensemble technique was used to create the best performing final model. The results showed that the alpha wave of the electroencephalography signal in the early period (12-15 s) contributed most to the prediction of dialectical thinking. With data-driven electrode selection (FC1, FCz, Fz, FC3, Cz, AFz), the prediction model achieved an average coefficient of determination of 0.45 on 200 random test sets. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between the alpha value of standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography activity in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dialectical self-scale score. The prefrontal and midline alpha oscillations of resting electroencephalography are good predictors of the dispositional level of dialectical thinking, possibly reflecting these brain structures' involvement in dialectical thinking.

However, the existing studies are mainly focused on normal or depression subjects, and few reports on hearing-impaired subjects. In this work, we have collected the EEG signals of 15 hearing-impaired subjects for categorizing three types of emotions (positive, neutral, and negative). To study the differences in functional connectivity between normal and hearing-impaired subjects under different emotional states, a novel brain network stacking ensemble learning framework was proposed. The phase-locking value (PLV) was utilized to calculate the correlation between EEG channels, and then we constructed a brain network using double thresholds. The spatial features of the brain network were extracted from the perspectives of local differentiation and global integration. In addition, the stacking ensemble learning framework was used to classify the fused features. To evaluate the proposed model, extensive experiments were carried out on the SEED dataset, and the result shows that the proposed method achieved superior performance than state-of-the-art models, in which the average classification accuracy is 0.955 (std: 0.052). In addition, the experimental results of hearing-impaired emotion recognition show that the average classification accuracy is 0.984 (std: 0.005). Finally, we investigated the activation patterns to reveal important brain regions and inter-channel relations about emotion recognition.

J	Malan, NS; Sharma, S				Malan, Nitesh Singh; Sharma, Shiru			Time window and frequency band optimization using regularized neighbourhood component analysis for Multi-View Motor Imagery EEG classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Electroencephalogram; Motor imagery; Neighbourhood component analysis	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SELECTION; FILTERS	Spatial features optimized at frequency bands have been widely used in motor imagery (MI) based braincomputer interface (BCI) systems. However, using a fixed time window of electroencephalogram (EEG) to extract discriminatory features results in suboptimal MI classification performance because time latency during MI tasks is inconsistent between different subjects. Thus, apart from frequency band optimization, time window optimization is equally important to develop a subject-specific MI-BCI. With time windows, extracted feature space becomes a higher-order tensor problem that requires multi-view learning approaches to optimize features. This study proposes a novel multi-view feature selection method based on regularized neighbourhood component analysis to simultaneously optimize time windows and frequency bands. In the experiment, we extracted spatial features using common spatial patterns (CSP) from MI related EEG data at multiple time windows and frequency bands and optimized them using the proposed feature selection method. A support vector machine is trained to classify optimized CSP features to identify MI tasks. The proposed method achieved classification accuracies on three public BCI datasets (BCI competition IV dataset 2a, BCI competition III dataset IIIa, and BCI competition IV dataset 2b), which are 82.1 %, 91.7 %, and 84.5 %, respectively. Obtained results are superior to those obtained using standard competing algorithms. Hence, the proposed multi-view learning approach for simultaneous optimization of time windows and frequency bands of MI signals shows the potential to enhance a practical MI BCI device?s performance.

Methods: The complexity and synchronization of the EEG were characterized using FuzzyEn and PLV in five frequency bands, respectively. By combining the two methods, the changes in the health of brain function were comprehensively analyzed. The extreme learning machine (ELM) method was used to classify aMCI patients based on a multi-dimensional index. Results: Compared with aMCI patients, the multiscale FuzzyEn and PLV of normal controls (NC) were higher and statistically significant (P < 0.05) in the Fp1 and Fp2 channels. Moreover, significant correlation existed between the multiscale FuzzyEn or PLV and the MoCA scores in the Fp1 and Fp2 channels. The classification accuracy and running time based on ELM in the prefrontal lobe were 83.34% and 0.003 s, respectively. Concludes: The multi-dimensional index based on prefrontal lobe could diagnosis cognitive decline of aMCI patients. Significance: The results showed that features integrated multiscale FuzzyEn and PLV could be used as a biomarker of cognitive decline and help realize the early diagnosis of aMCI patients.

In the field of machine learning, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has attracted more and more attention due to its intuitive and good learning performance for emotion recognition. However, the existing GSSL methods are sensitive or not robust enough to noise or outlier electroencephalogram (EEG)-based data since each individual subject may present noise or outlier EEG patterns in the same scenario. To address the problem, in this paper, we invent a Possibilistic Clustering-Promoting semi-supervised learning method for EEG-based Emotion Recognition. Specifically, it constrains each instance to have the same label membership value with its local weighted mean to improve the reliability of the recognition method. In addition, a regularization term about fuzzy entropy is introduced into the objective function, and the generalization ability of membership function is enhanced by increasing the amount of sample discrimination information, which improves the robustness of the method to noise and the outlier. A large number of experimental results on the three real datasets (i.e., DEAP, SEED, and SEED-IV) show that the proposed method improves the reliability and robustness of the EEG-based emotion recognition.

Since P300 wave is a cognitive response across multiple brain channels correlated between the measured electroencephalogram (EEG) and deviant stimulus in a specific period, it requires a suitable signal processing application for interpretation. Moreover, multiple steps of data processing under neuroscience criteria make the P300 reflection difficult to analyze by common methods. Therefore, this study proposes the processing model for brainwave applications based on P300 peak signal detection in multiple brain channels. This study applies 64 channels ERP datasets throughout bandpass filter in fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the specific ranges of signal processing while ERP averaging is applied as a feature extraction method. Furthermore, the experimental metadata is applied with the filtered P300 peak signals in channel classification via a machine learning method, the Decision Tree. The experimental results indicate the accurate mental reflection of P300 evoked potential in different brain channels with high classification accuracy relying on the contrast condition throughout the original data source averaged across the individual electrodes.

Because MI-based BCI offers a high degree of freedom, it helps people with motor disabilities communicate with the device by performing a sequence of MI tasks. Several techniques are being developed to improve the classification performance of the MI signals used in BCI. Most researches focused on improving methods for feature extraction and selection, but relied on linear classifiers for class prediction. In this paper, we investigate the use of ensemble learning methods to improve classification accuracy in a BCI paradigm based on 2-class MIs. We propose and compare eight combinations of classifiers on the BCI Competition III dataset IVb. The results obtained show that the combination of three classifiers: Radial Basis Function-Kernel Support Vector Machine (RBF-Kernel SVM), Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM) and Decision Tree, gives the best value of kappa which is equal to 0.783. This combination can be successfully applied to BCI systems where the amount of data stems largely from daily recording.

These patients are given an alternative from their neural path through Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems, which are the explicit use of brain impulses without any need for a computer's vocal muscle. Nowadays, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) modality offers a robust communication pathway to introduce a non-invasive BCI. There are some crucial constituents, including window length of SSVEP response, the number of electrodes in the acquisition device and system accuracy, which are the critical performance components in any BCI system based on SSVEP signal. In this study, a real-time hybrid BCI system consists of SSVEP and EMG has been proposed for the environmental control system. The feature in terms of the common spatial pattern (CSP) has been extracted from four classes of SSVEP response, and extracted feature has been classified using K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) based classification algorithm. The obtained classification accuracy of eight participants was 97.41%. Finally, a control mechanism that aims to apply for the environmental control system has also been developed. The proposed system can identify 18 commands (i.e., 16 control commands using SSVEP and two commands using EMG). This result represents very encouraging performance to handle real-time SSVEP based BCI system consists of a small number of electrodes. The proposed framework can offer a convenient user interface and a reliable control method for realistic BCI technology.

J	Masood, N; Farooq, H				Masood, Naveen; Farooq, Humera			Comparing Neural Correlates of Human Emotions across Multiple Stimulus Presentation Paradigms	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						classification; common spatial pattern (CSP); electroencephalography (EEG); emotional imagery; emotions; feature extraction	PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG ACTIVITY; CLASSIFICATION; ASYMMETRY; ALGORITHM; RESPONSES; SELECTION; MUSIC; FACES	Most electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition systems rely on a single stimulus to evoke emotions. These systems make use of videos, sounds, and images as stimuli. Few studies have been found for self-induced emotions. The question "if different stimulus presentation paradigms for same emotion, produce any subject and stimulus independent neural correlates" remains unanswered. Furthermore, we found that there are publicly available datasets that are used in a large number of studies targeting EEG-based human emotional state recognition. Since one of the major concerns and contributions of this work is towards classifying emotions while subjects experience different stimulus-presentation paradigms, we need to perform new experiments. This paper presents a novel experimental study that recorded EEG data for three different human emotional states evoked with four different stimuli presentation paradigms. Fear, neutral, and joy have been considered as three emotional states. In this work, features were extracted with common spatial pattern (CSP) from recorded EEG data and classified through linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The considered emotion-evoking paradigms included emotional imagery, pictures, sounds, and audio-video movie clips. Experiments were conducted with twenty-five participants. Classification performance in different paradigms was evaluated, considering different spectral bands. With a few exceptions, all paradigms showed the best emotion recognition for higher frequency spectral ranges. Interestingly, joy emotions were classified more strongly as compared to fear. The average neural patterns for fear vs. joy emotional states are presented with topographical maps based on spatial filters obtained with CSP for averaged band power changes for all four paradigms. With respect to the spectral bands, beta and alpha oscillation responses produced the highest number of significant results for the paradigms under consideration. With respect to brain region, the frontal lobe produced the most significant results irrespective of paradigms and spectral bands. The temporal site also played an effective role in generating statistically significant findings. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted for EEG emotion recognition while considering four different stimuli paradigms. This work provides a good contribution towards designing EEG-based system for human emotion recognition that could work effectively in different real-time scenarios.

Because the human brain is very complex and the EEG signal is greatly affected by the environment, EEG mental recognition can be attributed to domain adaptative problems. Our main work is as follows: (1) At present, most domain adaptation learning only learns the linear subspace of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), and RKHS itself does not. Given the complexity and nonlinearity of EEG mental recognition, we propose an EEG mental recognition algorithm based on two learning. The two learning is RKHS learning and RKHS subspace learning. The source dictionary regularized RKHS subspace learning we proposed applies to EEG mental recognition and is better than pure RKHS subspace learning, but not enough. To get satisfactory results, we learn RKHS before RKHS subspace. (2) According to Moore-Aronszajn theorem, RKHS can be uniquely generated by a kernel function. The existing RKHS is rarely learnable. It is difficult to find a kernel function that can be learned and optimized. In RKHS learning, this paper uses a learnable kernel function that we published, and the kernel function is easy to optimize. (3) In RKHS subspace learning, most of the existing methods adopt the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion, but it cannot make the spatial distribution of the same category of source and target domain data overlap as much as possible, and the label of the target domain data is unknown. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework of RKHS subspace learning based on source domain dictionary regularization. The experimental results on the brain-computer interface international competition data set (BCI competition IV 2a) show that the effect of the algorithm proposed in this paper is better than that of the other five advanced domain adaptation learning algorithms.

One primary research focus area is the identification of bio-markers that not only identify stress but also predict the conditions (or tasks) that cause stress. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been used for a long time to study and identify bio-markers. While these bio-markers have successfully predicted stress in EEG studies for binary conditions, their performance is suboptimal for multiple conditions of stress. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we propose using latent based representations of the bio-markers, which have been shown to significantly improve EEG performance compared to traditional bio-markers alone. We evaluated three commonly used EEG based bio-markers for stress, the brain load index (BLI), the spectral power values of EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta and theta), and the relative gamma (RG), with their respective latent representations using four commonly used classifiers. Results: The results show that spectral power value based bio-markers had a high performance with an accuracy of 83%, while the respective latent representations had an accuracy of 91%.

Most current EEG studies work in a task driven manner and explore the valid EEG features with a supervised model, which would be limited by the given labels to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a practical hybrid unsupervised deep convolutional recurrent generative adversarial network based EEG feature characterization and fusion model, which is termed as EEGFuseNet. EEGFuseNet is trained in an unsupervised manner, and deep EEG features covering both spatial and temporal dynamics are automatically characterized. Comparing to the existing features, the characterized deep EEG features could be considered to be more generic and independent of any specific EEG task. The performance of the extracted deep and low-dimensional features by EEGFuseNet is carefully evaluated in an unsupervised emotion recognition application based on three public emotion databases. The results demonstrate the proposed EEGFuseNet is a robust and reliable model, which is easy to train and performs efficiently in the representation and fusion of dynamic EEG features. In particular, EEGFuseNet is established as an optimal unsupervised fusion model with promising cross-subject emotion recognition performance. It proves EEGFuseNet is capable of characterizing and fusing deep features that imply comparative cortical dynamic significance corresponding to the changing of different emotion states, and also demonstrates the possibility of realizing EEG based cross-subject emotion recognition in a pure unsupervised manner.

We propose to use machine learning techniques and multiple continuously measured physiological signals to detect exposure, and to identify the chemical agent. Such detection and identification could be used to alert individuals to take appropriate medical counter measures in time. As a first step, we evaluated whether exposure to an opioid (fentanyl) or a nerve agent (VX) could be detected in freely moving guinea pigs using features from respiration, electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG), where machine learning models were trained and tested on different sets (across subject classification). Results showed this to be possible with close to perfect accuracy, where respiratory features were most relevant. Exposure detection accuracy rose steeply to over 95% correct during the first five minutes after exposure. Additional models were trained to correctly classify an exposed state as being induced either by fentanyl or VX. This was possible with an accuracy of almost 95%, where EEG features proved to be most relevant. Exposure detection models that were trained on subsets of animals generalized to subsets of animals that were exposed to other dosages of different chemicals. While future work is required to validate the principle in other species and to assess the robustness of the approach under different, realistic circumstances, our results indicate that utilizing different continuously measured physiological signals for early detection and identification of toxic agents is promising.

Therefore, in this work, the emotion classification problem is modelled as a sequence classification problem. The power band frequency based features of every time segment of EEG sequences generated from 32-channel EEG data are used to train three different models of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM1, LSTM2, and LSTM3). Four class (HVHA, HVLA, LVHA, and LVLA) classification experiments were performed based on the valence and arousal emotion models. The LSTM3 model with 128 memory cells achieved the highest classification accuracy of 90%, whereas LSTM1 (32 cells) and LSTM2 (64 cells) yielded classification accuracies of 85% and 89% respectively. Further, the impact of segment size on classification accuracy was also investigated in this work. Results obtained indicate that a smaller segment size leads to higher classification accuracy using LSTM models.

Low-Frequency Entrainment to Visual Motion Underlies Sign Language Comprehension	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Videos; Assistive technologies; Gesture recognition; Visualization; Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Coherence; EEG; sign language; perceptual sampling; vision; language comprehension	SPEECH; OSCILLATIONS	When people listen to speech, neural activity tracks the entropy fluctuation in the acoustic envelope of the signal. This signal-based entrainment has been shown to be the basis of speech parsing and comprehension. In this electroencephalography (EEG) study, we compute sign language users' cortical tracking of changes in visual dynamics of the communicative signal in the time-direct videos of sign language, and their time-reversed counterparts, and assess the relative contribution of response frequencies between.2 and 12.4 Hz to comprehension using a machine learning approach to brain state classification. Lower frequencies of EEG response (.2-4 Hz) yield 100% classification accuracy, while information about cortical tracking of the visual envelope in higher frequencies is less informative. This suggests that signers rely on lower visual frequency data, such as envelope of visual signal, for sign language comprehension. In the context of real-time language processing, given the speed of comprehension responses, this suggests that fluent signers employ a predictive processing heuristic based on sign language knowledge.

J	Lin, B; Deng, SG; Gao, HH; Yin, JW				Lin, Bo; Deng, Shuiguang; Gao, Honghao; Yin, Jianwei			A Multi-Scale Activity Transition Network for Data Translation in EEG Signals Decoding	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Convolution; Brain modeling; Recurrent neural networks; Decoding; Brain-computer interfaces; Electroencephalogram; convolutional neural networks; invariance; data translation; pyramid of activity states	DEEP; IMAGES; SYSTEM	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive collection method for brain signals. It has broad prospects in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Recent advances have shown the effectiveness of the widely used convolutional neural network (CNN) in EEG decoding. However, some studies reveal that a slight disturbance to the inputs, e.g., data translation, can change CNN's outputs. Such instability is dangerous for EEG-based BCI applications because signals in practice are different from training data. In this study, we propose a multi-scale activity transition network (MSATNet) to alleviate the influence of the translation problem in convolution-based models. MSATNet provides an activity state pyramid consisting of multi-scale recurrent neural networks to capture the relationship between brain activities, which is a translation-invariant feature. In the experiment, Kullback-Leibler divergence is applied to measure the degree of translation. The comprehensive results demonstrate that our method surpasses the AUC of 0.0080, 0.0254, 0.0393 in 1, 5, and 10 KL divergence compared to competitors with various convolution structures.

The simultaneous visibility of generated and natural objects often requires users to direct their selective attention to a specific target that is either real or virtual. In this study, we investigated whether this target is real or virtual by using machine learning techniques to classify electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye tracking data collected in augmented reality scenarios. A shallow convolutional neural net classified 3 second EEG data windows from 20 participants in a person-dependent manner with an average accuracy above 70% if the testing data and training data came from different trials. This accuracy could be significantly increased to 77% using a multimodal late fusion approach that included the recorded eye tracking data. Person-independent EEG classification was possible above chance level for 6 out of 20 participants. Thus, the reliability of such a brain-computer interface is high enough for it to be treated as a useful input mechanism for augmented reality applications.

J	Neeraj; Singhal, V; Mathew, J; Behera, RK				Neeraj; Singhal, Vatsal; Mathew, Jimson; Behera, Ranjan Kumar			Detection of alcoholism using EEG signals and a CNN-LSTM-ATTN network	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Time series; EEG; Alcoholism; FFT; Deep learning	CLASSIFICATION	Alcoholism is a serious disorder that poses a problem for modern society, but the detection of alcoholism has no widely accepted standard tests or procedures. If alcoholism goes undetected at its early stages, it can create havoc in the patient's life. An electroencephalography (EEG) is a method used to measure the brain's electrical activity and can detect alcoholism. EEG signals are complex and multi-channel and thus can be difficult to interpret manually. Several previous works have tried to classify a subject as alcoholic or control (non-alcoholic) based on EEG signals. Such works have mainly used machine learning or statistical techniques along with handcrafted features such as entropy, correlation dimension, Hurst exponent. With the growth in computational power and data volume worldwide, deep learning models have recently been gaining momentum in various fields. However, only a few studies are available on the application of deep learning models for the classification of alcoholism using EEG signals. This paper proposes a deep learning architecture that uses a combination of fast Fourier transform (FFT), a convolution neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and a recently proposed attention mechanism for extracting Spatio-temporal features from multi-channel EEG signals. The proposed architecture can classify a subject as an alcoholic or control with a high degree of accuracy by analyzing EEG signals of that subject and can be used for automating alcoholism detection. The analytical results using the proposed architecture show a 98.83% accuracy, making it better than most state-of-the-art algorithms.

However, only the amplitude information is utilized in most electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Few of the existing methods can simultaneously measure the amplitude and phase information required for classification. In this study, a novel common amplitude-phase measurement (CAPM) method is proposed. This method is capable of jointly measuring the phase and amplitude information of EEG signals on the Riemannian manifold. The proposed CAPM method comprises a two-step approach. First, a novel Riemannian graph embedding is proposed for dimensionality reduction while performing spatial-spectral filtering. The graph embedding is excellent in capturing the intrinsic features contained by the physiological signal. Second, to enhance robustness, a novel classifier is designed to incorporate the regularized linear regression in the computation of Riemannian distance. Experimental results on two BCI competition datasets demonstrate CAPM can yield high classification performance. The proposed CAPM method is a promising tool in analyzing EEG amplitude-phase characteristics and exhibits great potential in BCI applications.

Previous research based on hand movements Electroencephalogram (EEG) has shown limited success in precise and natural control. In this study, we explored the possibilities of decoding movement types and kinematic information for three reach-and-execute actions using movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs). EEG signals were acquired from 12 healthy subjects during the execution of pinch, palmar and precision disk rotation actions that involved two levels of speeds and forces. In the case of discrimination between hand movement types under each of four different kinematics conditions, we obtained the average peak accuracies of 83.44% and 73.83% for the binary and 3-class classification, respectively. In the case of discrimination between different movement kinematics for each of three actions, the average peak accuracies of 82.9% and 58.2% could be achieved for the two and 4-class scenario. In both cases, peak decoding performance was significantly higher than the subject-specific chance level. We found that hand movement types all could be classified when these actions were executed at four different kinematic parameters. Meanwhile, for each of three hand movements, we decoded movement parameters successfully. Furthermore, the feasibility of decoding hand movements during hand retraction process was also demonstrated. These findings are of great importance for controlling neuroprosthesis or other rehabilitation devices in a fine and natural way, which would drastically increase the acceptance of motor impaired users.

Wearable and portable brain-computer interface devices provide a powerful means for real-time monitoring of the vigilance level of drivers to help with avoiding distracted or impaired driving. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for in-vehicle vigilance estimation from Electroencephalogram and Electrooculogram. To enable the system to focus on the most salient parts of the learned multimodal representations, we propose an architecture composed of a capsule attention mechanism following a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Our model learns hierarchical dependencies in the data through the LSTM and capsule feature representation layers. To better explore the discriminative ability of the learned representations, we study the effect of the proposed capsule attention mechanism including the number of dynamic routing iterations as well as other parameters. Experiments show the robustness of our method by outperforming other solutions and baseline techniques, setting a new state-of-the-art. We then provide an analysis on different frequency bands and brain regions to evaluate their suitability for driver vigilance estimation. Lastly, an analysis on the role of capsule attention, multimodality, and robustness to noise is performed, highlighting the advantages of our approach.

However, long-time attention to repetitive visual stimuli could cause physical and psychological fatigue, resulting in weaker reliable response and stronger noise interference, which exacerbates the difficulty of Visual Evoked Potentials EEG decoding. In this state, subjects' attention could not be concentrated enough and the frequency response of their brains becomes less reliable. To solve these problems, we propose an attention-based parallel multiscale convolutional neural network (AMS-CNN). Specifically, the AMS-CNN first extract robust temporal representations via two parallel convolutional layers with small and large temporal filters respectively. Then, we employ two sequential convolution blocks for spatial fusion and temporal fusion to extract advanced feature representations. Further, we use attention mechanism to weight the features at different moments according to the output-related interest. Finally, we employ a full connected layer with softmax activation function for classification. Two fatigue datasets collected from our lab are implemented to validate the superior classification performance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

The present manuscript uses computational modeling and machine learning to test the hypothesis that alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations are involved in the updating of expectations based on experience. Participants learned that a visual cue predicted an aversive loud noise with a probability of 50%. The Rescorla-Wagner model of associative learning explained trial-wise changes in self-reported noise expectancy as well as alpha power changes. Experience in the past trial and self-reported expectancy for the subsequent trial were accurately decoded based on the topographical distribution of alpha power at specific latencies. Decodable information during initial association formation and contingency report recurred when viewing the conditioned cue. Findings support the idea that alpha oscillations have multiple, temporally specific, roles in the formation of associations between cues and outcomes.

Nowadays electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based machine learning methods have been proposed to help medical professionals. Materials and method: In this work, we have proposed a novel Collatz conjecture-based automated schizophrenia detection model using EEG signals. The objectives of the presented model are to show the feature generation ability of conjecture-based structure and present a highly accurate EEG-based schizophrenia detection model with low time burden. Our presented model comprises three stages. (i) New feature generation function is presented using Collatz Conjecture, and named as Collatz pattern. Combination of Collatz pattern and maximum absolute pooling decomposer, a new multilevel feature generation method is employed to extract both low-level and high-level features. (ii) The iterative neighborhood component analysis (INCA) is employed on the selected features to select the clinically significant features. (iii) The chosen features are fed to k nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for automated deetction of SZ. Results: Our developed Collatz conjecture-based automated SZ detection model is validated using two public schizophrenia databases with 19 and 10 channels corresponding to database-1 (DB1) and database-2 (DB2) datasets, respectively. We have obtained the classification accuracy of 99.47% and 93.58% for DB1 and DB2 datasets, respectively, with ten-fold cross-validation strategy. Conclusions: Our developed model is accurate and robust in detecting SZ using EEG signals. Our deevloped automated system is ready for clinical usage in hospitals and polyclinics to assist clinicians in their diagnosis as an adjunct tool.

EEG was recorded during methodologically similar tasks with different attentional loads: choice-reaction task (CRT) and simple-reaction task (SRT). This approach minimalizes the influence of other cognitive processes or motor preparation on classification results and thus shows the real discrimination of attentive states. We applied a Hilbert transformation to single trial EEG data to extract selected signal features and then compared the effectiveness of three classifiers: Extra Trees (ET), Support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression; as well as two methods of feature selection: an ANOVA-based method and Sequential backward floating selection (SBFS). ET and SVM classifiers and logistic regression yielded similar classification results. Classification accuracy was up to 100% for individual subjects and 89% was the average classification accuracy for all subjects after SBFS with the use of ET and logistic regression. ET achieved the highest precision (91%) and specificity (91%), whereas highest sensitivity (89%) was observed for LR.

This article proposes a novel EEG fusion method to examine the reliability and durability of EEG biometric markers across recording sessions. Our hypothesis is that models trained using EEG signals collected during various elicitation protocols can capture generalised brain patterns that pertain personalised information which can improve the durability of biometric systems. Different protocols are likely to produce different responses across brain regions, which can result in more identifiable responses from EEG. In our approach, an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) model is adopted for feature extraction and classification of raw EEG data. The proposed method is evaluated on two EEG datasets which were collected over two separate sessions on different days using multiple different EEG elicitation protocols. Within-session and across-session experiments were conducted. Results for within session experiments showed that CNN models with protocol fusion can achieve similar if not better results than models trained with single protocol. In across-session scenarios, models trained with the proposed protocol fusion approach significantly outperformed single protocol based models. The obtained results illustrate the durability and reliability capabilities of the proposed fusion approach.

Early detection of seizures can help to mitigate injuries, and can be used to aid the treatment of patients with epilepsy. The purpose of a seizure prediction system is to successfully identify the pre-ictal brain stage, which occurs before a seizure event. Patient-independent seizure prediction models are designed to offer accurate performance across multiple subjects within a dataset, and have been identified as a real-world solution to the seizure prediction problem. However, little attention has been given for designing such models to adapt to the high inter-subject variability in EEG data. We propose two patient-independent deep learning architectures with different learning strategies that can learn a global function utilizing data from multiple subjects. Proposed models achieve state-of-the-art performance for seizure prediction on the CHB-MIT-EEG dataset, demonstrating 88.81% and 91.54% accuracy respectively. In conclusion, the Siamese model trained on the proposed learning strategy is able to learn patterns related to patient variations in data while predicting seizures. Our models show superior performance for patient-independent seizure prediction, and the same architecture can be used as a patient-specific classifier after model adaptation. We are the first study that employs model interpretation to understand classifier behavior for the task for seizure prediction, and we also show that the MFCC feature map utilized by our models contains predictive biomarkers related to interictal and pre-ictal brain states.

Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms can provide this information by, for example, reconstructing the attended speech envelope from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, these stimulus reconstruction decoders are traditionally trained in a supervised manner, requiring a dedicated training stage during which the attended speaker is known. Pre-trained subject-independent decoders alleviate the need of having such a per-user training stage but perform substantially worse than supervised subject-specific decoders that are tailored to the user. This motivates the development of a new unsupervised self-adapting training/updating procedure for a subject-specific decoder, which iteratively improves itself on unlabeled EEG data using its own predicted labels. This iterative updating procedure enables a self-leveraging effect, of which we provide a mathematical analysis that reveals the underlying mechanics. The proposed unsupervised algorithm, starting from a random decoder, results in a decoder that outperforms a supervised subject-independent decoder. Starting from a subject-independent decoder, the unsupervised algorithm even closely approximates the performance of a supervised subject-specific decoder. The developed unsupervised AAD algorithm thus combines the two advantages of a supervised subject-specific and subject-independent decoder: it approximates the performance of the former while retaining the 'plug-and-play' character of the latter. As the proposed algorithm can be used to automatically adapt to new users, as well as over time when new EEG data is being recorded, it contributes to more practical neuro-steered hearing devices.

Meanwhile, machine learning is a promising approach for trial-based EEG data analysis. This work presents a model that can distinguish between passive and active kinesthetic interactions based on a single trial EEG data. An interactive task that involves hitting a ball using a racket is developed under passive and active kinesthetic settings using a haptic device and a computer screen. Temporal and frequency domain features are extracted from the motor and somatosensory cortices, and a proposed 2-D CNN model is trained on data extracted from 19 participants. The model achieves a mean accuracy of 84.56%, 93.96%, and 95.89% across 5-fold validation when using one, four, or six electrodes, respectively. The model mechanism is assessed using an explainable machine learning algorithm, LIME, which shows that the model utilizes sensible features from a neuroscience perspective towards its prediction. This work paves the way for a better understanding of the neural mechanisms associated with kinesthetic haptic interaction, which proves helpful in many applications such as motor rehabilitation and brain-computer interactions, in addition to modeling the haptic quality of experience objectively.

Considering that speech is a complex cognitive process which requires coordinated activity of a number of cortical structures of the large hemispheres, the EEG coherence values were studied. The values were recorded from 14 channels of 10 young men in the process of real verbalization (spoken speech) and during pronunciation of imagined words designating directions in space (up, down, right, left, forward, backward). It was shown that the level of EEG coherence is generally higher for real verbalization, most significantly at gamma-2-rhythm frequencies (55-70 Hz). Spatial coherence patterns specific to a number of words are formed in the left cerebral hemisphere during imagined utterance of words at gamma-2 frequencies. The application of machine learning and neural network classification has demonstrated a significant similarity of the generated spatial coherent patterns of spoken and inner (imagined) speech. The Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network classification method has shown the accuracy of word detection in the imagined speech according to brain activity patterns up to 49-61% for 3 classes and 33-40% for 7 classes, with a random recognition rate of 33,3 and 14,2% respectively.

The existing emotion recognition models, that use stimuli such as music and pictures in controlled lab settings and limited number of emotion classes, have low ecological validity. Moreover, for effective emotion recognition identifying significant EEG features and electrodes is important. In our proposed model, we use the DEAP dataset consisting of physiological signals collected from 32 participants as they watched 40 movie (each of 60 seconds) clips. The main objective of this study is to explore multi-domain (time, wavelet, and frequency) features and hence, identify the set of stable features which contribute towards emotion classification catering to a larger number of emotion classes. Our proposed model is able to identify nine classes of emotions including happy, pleased, relaxed, excited, neutral, calm, distressed, miserable, and depressed with an average accuracy of 65.92%. Towards this end, we use support vector machine as a classifier along with 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation techniques. We achieve a significant emotion classification accuracy which could be vital towards developing solutions for affective computing and deal with a larger number of emotional states.

However, due to the influence of nonstationary in electroencephalography (EEG) and inherent defects of the CSP objective function, the spatial filters, and their corresponding features are not necessarily optimal in the feature space used within CSP. In this work, we design a new feature selection method to address this issue by selecting features based on an improved objective function. Especially, improvements are made in suppressing outliers and discovering features with larger interclass distances. Moreover, a fusion algorithm based on the Dempster-Shafer theory is proposed, which takes into consideration the distribution of features. With two competition data sets, we first evaluate the performance of the improved objective functions in terms of classification accuracy, feature distribution, and embeddability. Then, a comparison with other feature selection methods is carried out in both accuracy and computational time. Experimental results show that the proposed methods consume less additional computational cost and result in a significant increase in the performance of MI-based BCI systems.

As EEG inherently suffers from a poor spatial resolution, features extracted from each EEG channel may not be efficiently used for the cognitive state assessment. In this paper, the EEG-based cognitive state assessment has been performed during the mental arithmetic experiment, which includes two cognitive states (task and rest) of a user. To obtain the temporal as well as the spatial resolution of the EEG signal, we combined the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) method and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep ensemble model for classifying the cognitive state of a user. Subject-wise data distribution has been performed due to the execution of a large volume of data in a low computing environment. In the FBCSP method, the input EEG is decomposed into multiple equal-sized frequency bands, and spatial features of each frequency bands are extracted using the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm. Next, a feature selection algorithm has been applied to identify the most informative features for classification. The proposed deep ensemble model consists of multiple similar structured LSTM networks that work in parallel. The output of the ensemble model (i.e., the cognitive state of a user) is computed using the average weighted combination of the individual model prediction. This proposed model achieves 87% classification accuracy, and it can also effectively estimate the cognitive state of a user in a low computing environment.

However, a long period of training is required to master brain rhythms' self-regulation, resulting in users with MI inefficiency. We introduce a parameter-based approach of cross-subject transfer-learning to improve the performances of poor-performing individuals in MI-based BCI systems, pooling data from labeled EEG measurements and psychological questionnaires via kernel-embedding. To this end, a Deep and Wide neural network for MI classification is implemented to pre-train the network from the source domain. Then, the parameter layers are transferred to initialize the target network within a fine-tuning procedure to recompute the Multilayer Perceptron-based accuracy. To perform data-fusion combining categorical features with the real-valued features, we implement stepwise kernel-matching via Gaussian-embedding. Finally, the paired source-target sets are selected for evaluation purposes according to the inefficiency-based clustering by subjects to consider their influence on BCI motor skills, exploring two choosing strategies of the best-performing subjects (source space): single-subject and multiple-subjects. Validation results achieved for discriminant MI tasks demonstrate that the introduced Deep and Wide neural network presents competitive performance of accuracy even after the inclusion of questionnaire data.

The non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are converted to networks by transforming the signals into a Correlation Matrix and analyzing the resulting networks. Here, four learning models, namely, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), are implemented on two different types of correlation matrices: Correlation Matrix (static connectivity) and Time-resolved Correlation Matrix (dynamic connectivity), to classify them either on their psychometric assessment or the effect of therapy. These correlation matrices are different from traditional learning techniques in the sense that they incorporate theory-based graph features into the learning models, thus providing novelty to this study. The EEG data used in this study is trail-based/event-related from five different experimental paradigms, of which can be broadly classified as working memory tasks and assessment of emotional states (depression, anxiety, and stress). The classifications based on RNN provided higher accuracy (74-88%) than the other three models (50-78%). Instead of using individual graph features, a Correlation Matrix provides an initial test of the data. When compared with the Time-resolved Correlation Matrix, it offered a 4-5% higher accuracy. The Time-resolved Correlation Matrix is better suited for dynamic studies here; it provides lower accuracy when compared to the Correlation Matrix, a static feature.

The identification of pain from brain activity as neural readout may effectively provide a neural code for pain, and further provide useful information for pain diagnosis and treatment. Advances in neuroimaging and large-scale electrophysiology have enabled us to examine neural activity with improved spatial and temporal resolution, providing opportunities to decode pain in humans and freely behaving animals. This topical review provides a systematical overview of state-of-the-art methods for decoding pain from brain signals, with special emphasis on electrophysiological and neuroimaging modalities. We show how pain decoding analyses can help pain diagnosis and discovery of neurobiomarkers for chronic pain. Finally, we discuss the challenges in the research field and point to several important future research directions.

J	Rivera, MJ; Teruel, MA; Mate, A; Trujillo, J				Rivera, Manuel J.; Teruel, Miguel A.; Mate, Alejandro; Trujillo, Juan			Diagnosis and prognosis of mental disorders by means of EEG and deep learning: a systematic mapping study	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW			English	Article						Deep learning; Diagnosis; Electroencephalogram; systematic mapping study; Mental disorder; Prognosis	EPILEPTIC SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; SLEEP; BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ALGORITHMS; PREDICTION; BIOMARKERS; DEMENTIA	Electroencephalography (EEG) is used in the diagnosis and prognosis of mental disorders because it provides brain biomarkers. However, only highly trained doctors can interpret EEG signals due to its complexity. Machine learning has been successfully trained with EEG signals for classifying mental disorders, but a time consuming and disorder-dependant feature engineering (FE) and subsampling process is required over raw EEG data. Deep Learning (DL) is positioned as a prominent research field to process EEG data because (i) it features automated FE by taking advantage of raw EEG signals improving results and (ii) it can be trained over the vast amount of data generated by EEG. In this work, a systematic mapping study has been performed with 46 carefully selected primary studies. Our goals were (i) to provide a clear view of which are the most prominent study topics in diagnosis and prognosis of mental disorders by using EEG with DL, and (ii) to give some recommendations for future works. Some results are: epilepsy was the predominant mental disorder present in around half of the studies, convolutional neural networks also appear in approximate 50% of the works. The main conclusions are (i) processing EEG with DL to detect mental disorders is a promising research field and (ii) to objectively compare performance between studies: public datasets, intra-subject validation, and standard metrics should be used. Additionally, we suggest to pay more attention to ease the reproducibility, and to use (when possible) an available framework to explain the results of the created DL models.

This technology holds big potential in various application domains, e.g. restoring communication abilities for handicapped people, or in settings where overtly spoken speech is not an option due to environmental conditions, e.g. noisy industrial or aerospace settings. However, one major drawback of this technology still is the limited number of words which can be distinguished at a time. This work therefore introduces the concept of Semantic Silent Speech BCIs, which adds a layer for semantic category classification prior to the actual word classification to multiply the number of classifiable words in Silent Speech BCIs many times over. We evaluated the possibilities of classifying 5 different semantic categories of words during a word imagination task by comparing various feature extraction and classification methods. Our results show remarkable classification accuracies of up to 95% for the single best subject with a Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and a best average classification accuracy of 60.44% for a combination of CSP and a Random Forrest (RF) classifier. Even a cross-subject analysis over the data of all subjects lead to results above the chance level of 20%, with a best performance of 43.54% for a self assembled feature vector and a RF classifier. Those results clearly indicate that the classification of the semantic category of an imagined word from EEG activity is possible and therefor lay the foundation for Semantic Silent Speech BCIs in the future.

Its impact on the human brain has been an exciting research topic for the past several decades. Electroen-cephalography (EEG) signal enables the non-invasive measurement of brain activity. Leveraging the recent advancements in deep learning, we proposed a novel approach for song identification using a Convolution Neural network given the electroencephalography (EEG) responses. We recorded the EEG signals from a group of 20 participants while listening to a set of 12 song clips, each of approximately 2 minutes, that were presented in random order. The repeating nature of Music is captured by a data slicing approach considering brain signals of 1 second duration as representative of each song clip. More specifically, we predict the song corresponding to one second of EEG data when given as input rather than a complete two-minute response. We have also discussed pre-processing steps to handle large dimensions of a dataset and various CNN architectures. For all the experiments, we have considered each participant's EEG response for each song in both train and test data. We have obtained 84.96% accuracy for the same at 0.3 train-test split ratio. Moreover, our model gave commendable results as compare to chance level probability when trained on only 10% of the total dataset. The performance observed gives appropriate implication towards the notion that listening to a song creates specific patterns in the brain, and these patterns vary from person to person.

J	Mehra, D; Tiwari, A; Joshi, D				Mehra, Dhruv; Tiwari, Ashutosh; Joshi, Deepak			Investigating neural correlates of locomotion transition via temporal relation of EEG and EOG-recorded eye movements	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EOG; EEG; Intention decoding; Neural machine interface (NMI)		The present study examines a temporal relation of walking behavior during locomotion transition (walking to stair ascent) to electrooculography (EOG) signals recorded from eye movement. Further, electroencephalography (EEG) signals from the occipital region of the brain are processed to understand the relative occurrence in EOG and EEG signals during the transition. The dipole sources in the occipital region with reference to EOG detection were estimated from independent components and then clustered using the k means algorithm. The dynamics of the dipoles in the occipital cluster in different frequency bands revealed significant desynchronization in the beta and low gamma bands, followed by resynchronization. This transitional behavior coincided with transient features suggesting possible saccadic movement of the eyes in the EOG signal. With the data from six able-bodied participants, the desynchronization in EEG from the occipital region was detected by nearly 2.2 +/- 0.5s before the transition. Using preprocessing techniques on the EOG signal followed by detecting saccades from the derivative of the EOG signal, the eye movements were detected by nearly 2.5 +/- 0.5s before the transition. The EOG decoded intention of transition appeared as early as 3.0 +/- 1.63s before desynchronization in the EEG. A paired t-test analysis showed that the EOG-based intent decoding of transition reflects significantly earlier than occipital EEG (p < 0.00001). This study could lead to a multi-modal neural-machine interface that may produce results superior to previous attempts involving only EEG and EMG signals.

However, human variability in the EEG activities hinders the development of practical applications of EEG-based BCI. To tackle this problem, many transfer-learning techniques perform supervised calibration. This kind of calibration approach requires task-relevant data, which is impractical in real-life scenarios such as drowsiness during driving. This study presents a transfer-learning framework for EEG decoding based on the low-dimensional representations of subjects learned from the pre-trial EEG. Tensor decomposition was applied to the pre-trial EEG of subjects to extract the underlying characteristics in subject, spatial, and spectral domains. Then, the proposed framework assessed the characteristics to obtain the low-dimensional subject representations such that the subjects with similar brain dynamics can be identified. This method can leverage the existing data from other users, and a small number of data from a rapid, non-task, unsupervised calibration from a new user to build an accurate BCI. Our results demonstrated that, in terms of prediction accuracy, the proposed low-dimensional subject representation-based transfer learning (LDSR-TL) framework outperformed the random selection, and the Riemannian manifold approach in cognitive-state tracking, while requiring fewer training data. The results can greatly improve the practicability, and usability of EEG-based BCI in the real world.

EEG Correlates of Difficulty Levels in Dynamical Transitions of Simulated Flying and Mapping Tasks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cognitive; difficulty; electroencephalography (EEG); EEG correlates; transitions; workload		Decoding the subjective perception of task difficulty may help improve operator performance, i.e., automatically optimize the task difficulty level. Here, we aim to decode a compound of cognitive states that covaries with the task difficulty level. We designed a protocol composed of two different subtasks, flying and visual recognition, to induce different difficulty levels. We first showed that electroencephalography (EEG) signals can be a reliable source for discriminating different compound states. To gain insight into the underlying components in the compound states, we examined the attentional index and engagement index as in our previous study. We showed that, first, attention and engagement are essential components but fail to provide the best accuracy, and, second, our model is consistent with our previous study, which means that lateralized modulations in the $\alpha$ bands are representative of the flying task. We also analyzed a practical issue in the design of adaptive human-machine interaction (HMI) systems, namely, the latency of changes in the user's compound state. We hypothesized that the EEG correlates of the task difficulty level do not instantaneously reflect the changes in the task difficulty. We validated the hypothesis by measuring the time required for our decoders to provide stable accuracy after the task changed. This amount of time, or latency, could be as high as ten seconds. The results suggest that the latency of changes in the user's compound state between different tasks is a factor that should be taken into account when building adaptive HMI systems.

Twenty five healthy subjects performed a three-level N-back test using a fully mobile setup including tablet-based presentation of the task and EEG data collection with a self-mounted mobile EEG device at two assessment time points. A two-fold analysis approach was chosen including a standard analysis of variance and an artificial neural network to distinguish the levels of cognitive load. Our findings indicate that the setup is feasible for detecting changes in cognitive load, as reflected by alterations across lobes in different frequency bands. In particular, we observed a decrease of occipital alpha and an increase in frontal, parietal and occipital theta with increasing cognitive load. The most distinct levels of cognitive load could be discriminated by the integrated machine learning models with an accuracy of 86%.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from children with autism have a common morphological pattern which makes them distinguishable from normal EEG. We have used this type of signal to design and implement an automated autism detection model. Materials and method: We propose a hybrid lightweight deep feature extractor to obtain high classification performance. The system was designed and tested with a big EEG dataset that contained signals from autism patients and normal controls. (i) A new signal to image conversion model is presented in this paper. In this work, features are extracted from EEG signal using one-dimensional local binary pattern (1D_LBP) and the generated features are utilized as input of the short time Fourier transform (STFT) to generate spectrogram images. (ii) The deep features of the generated spectrogram images are extracted using a combination of pre-trained MobileNetV2, ShuffleNet, and SqueezeNet models. This method is named hybrid deep lightweight feature generator. (iii) A two-layered ReliefF algorithm is used for feature ranking and feature selection. (iv) The most discriminative features are fed to various shallow classifiers, developed using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy for automated autism detection. Results: A support vector machine (SVM) classifier reached 96.44% accuracy based on features from the proposed model. Conclusions: The results strongly indicate that the proposed hybrid deep lightweight feature extractor is suitable for autism detection using EEG signals. The model is ready to serve as part of an adjunct tool that aids neurologists during autism diagnosis in medical centers.

A Deep Learning Strategy for Automatic Sleep Staging Based on Two-Channel EEG Headband Data	SENSORS			English	Article						deep learning; EEG headband; sleep staging; machine learning; neurodegenerative disease; sleep	NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM	Sleep disturbances are common in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, and together represent a potential therapeutic target for disease modification. A major barrier for studying sleep in patients with dementia is the requirement for overnight polysomnography (PSG) to achieve formal sleep staging. This is not only costly, but also spending a night in a hospital setting is not always advisable in this patient group. As an alternative to PSG, portable electroencephalography (EEG) headbands (HB) have been developed, which reduce cost, increase patient comfort, and allow sleep recordings in a person's home environment. However, naive applications of current automated sleep staging systems tend to perform inadequately with HB data, due to their relatively lower quality. Here we present a deep learning (DL) model for automated sleep staging of HB EEG data to overcome these critical limitations. The solution includes a simple band-pass filtering, a data augmentation step, and a model using convolutional (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. With this model, we have achieved 74% (+/- 10%) validation accuracy on low-quality two-channel EEG headband data and 77% (+/- 10%) on gold-standard PSG. Our results suggest that DL approaches achieve robust sleep staging of both portable and in-hospital EEG recordings, and may allow for more widespread use of ambulatory sleep assessments across clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders.

Leveraging Synthetic Subject Invariant EEG Signals for Zero Calibration BCI	2020 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION (ICPR)	International Conference on Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)	JAN 10-15, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, IEEE Comp Soc, Italian Assoc Comp Vis Pattern Recognit & Machine Learning				Recently, substantial progress has been made in the area of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) using modern machine learning techniques to decode and interpret brain signals. While Electroencephalography (EEC) has provided a non-invasive method of interfacing with a human brain, the acquired data is often heavily subject and session dependent. This makes the seamless incorporation of such data into realworld applications intractable as the subject and session data variance can lead to long and tedious calibration requirements and cross-subject generalisation issues. Focusing on a Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) classification systems, we propose a novel means of generating highly-realistic synthetic EEG data invariant to any subject, session or other environmental conditions. Our approach, entitled the Subject Invariant SSVEP Generative Adversarial Network (SIS-GAN), produces synthetic EEC data from multiple SSVEP classes using a single network. Additionally, by taking advantage of a fixed-weight pre-trained subject classification network, we ensure that our generative model remains agnostic to subject-specific features and thus produces subject-invariant data that can be applied to new previously unseen subjects. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our synthetic data, leading to superior performance, with improvements of up to 16 percentage points in zero-calibration classification tasks when trained using our subject-invariant synthetic EEC signals.

Nevertheless, the approach has suffered from imbalanced datasets. Hence, to get a reliable predictive model for predicting outcomes, specifically in a high proportion of moderate TBI with good outcomes, could be challenging. This work proposes an improved outcome predictive model that combines the absolute power spectral density (PSD) as input features for training random under-sampling boosting decision trees (RUSBoosted Trees) as a classifier. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data were obtained from 27 moderate TBI patients with follow-up visits. Patient outcome at 4-10 weeks to 12-month was dichotomized based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale as poor (GOS score <= 4) and good outcomes (GOS score = 5). The predictive values of absolute PSD from -ve frequency bands: delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-7Hz), alpha (7-13Hz), beta (13-30Hz) and gamma (30-100Hz) were evaluated to identify the most informative predictors for reliable prediction outcomes. RUSBoosted Trees performed best at discriminating patients into two outcomes categories (G-Mean D 92.95%, TPrate = 100%, TNrate = 86.4%) of absolute PSD in alpha and gamma bands, which was excellent compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. The highest area under the curve (AUC) of absolute PSD in delta (AUC(delta) = 0.97) and gamma (AUC(gamma) = 0.95) revealed their predictive values as robust prognostic markers for prediction outcomes. The RUSBoosted Trees presents a promising result in prognosis prediction of highly imbalanced data, making it an accessible prediction tool for clinical decision-making, unlike the black-box approaches.

These works typically use EEG-based features, like power spectral density (PSD), to develop stress classifiers. Nonetheless, these classifiers are usually limited to the discrimination of two (stress and no stress) or three (low, medium, and high) stress levels. In this study we propose an alternative for quantitative stress assessment based on EEG and regression algorithms. To this aim, we conducted a group of 23 participants (mean age 22.65 +/- 5.48) over a stress-relax experience while monitoring their EEG. First, we stressed the participants via the Montreal imaging stress task (MIST), and then we led them through a 360-degree virtual reality (VR) relaxation experience. Throughout the session, the participants reported their self-perceived stress level (SPSL) via surveys. Subsequently, we extracted spectral features from the EEG of the participants and we developed individual models based on regression algorithms to predict their SPSL. We evaluated stress regression performance in terms of the mean squared percentage error (MSPE) and the correlation coefficient (R-2). The results yielded from this evaluation (MSPE = 10.62 +/- 2.12, R-2 = 0.92 +/- 0.02) suggest that our approach predicted the stress level of the participants with remarkable performance. These results may have a positive impact in diverse areas that could benefit from stress level quantitative prediction. These areas include research fields like neuromarketing, and training of professionals such as surgeons, industrial workers, or firefighters, that often face stressful situations.

This work proposes a system based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) as a feature extraction method for the classification of human brain resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded signals. In the proposed system, the FFT method is applied on the resting-state EEG recordings and the corresponding band powers were calculated. The extracted relative power features are supplied to the classification methods (classifiers) as an input for the classification purpose as a measure of human tiredness through predicting lactate enzyme level, high or low. To validate the suggested method, we used an EEG dataset which has been recorded from a group of elite-level athletes consisting of two classes: not tired, the EEG signals were recorded during the resting-state task before performing acute exercise and tired, the EEG signals were recorded in the resting-state after performing an acute exercise. The performance of three different classifiers was evaluated with two performance measures, accuracy and precision values. The accuracy was achieved above 98% by the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The findings of this study indicated that the feature extraction scheme has the ability to classify the analyzed EEG signals accurately and predict the level of lactate enzyme high or low. Many studying fields, like the Internet of Things (IoT) and the brain computer interface (BCI), can utilize the findings of the proposed system in many crucial decision-making applications.

Unlike related literature studies using traditional machine learning algorithms, the features required for the training of the network are automatically extracted from the EEG records in our method. In order to obtain the time frequency features of the EEG signals, the signal was converted into 2D by using the Continuous Wavelet Transform method. This study has the highest accuracy performance in the relevant literature by using 2D time frequency features in automatic detection of SZ disease. It is trained with Visual Geometry Group-16 (VGG16), an advanced convolutional neural networks (CNN) deep learning network architecture, to extract key features found on scalogram images and train the network. The study shows a high success in classifying SZ patients and healthy individuals with a very satisfactory accuracy of 98% and 99.5%, respectively, using two different datasets consisting of individuals from different age groups. Using different techniques [Activization Maximization, Saliency Map, and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)] to visualize the learning outcomes of the CNN network, the relationship of frequency components between SZ and the healthy individual is clearly shown. Moreover, with these interpretable outcomes, the difference between SZ patients and healthy individuals can be distinguished very easily help for expert opinion.

We here evaluate whether a simplified 4-frontal electrode montage ((4-front)EEG) can detect EEG patterns associated with poor outcomes in adult patients under veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO).MethodsWe conducted a reanalysis of EEG data from a prospective cohort on 118 adult patients under VA-ECMO, in whom EEG was performed on admission to intensive care. EEG patterns of interest included background rhythm, discontinuity, reactivity, and the Synek's score. They were all reassessed by an intensivist on a (4-front)EEG montage, whose analysis was then compared to an expert's interpretation made on (std)EEG recordings. The main outcome measure was the degree of correlation between (4-front)EEG and (std)EEG montages to identify EEG patterns of interest. The performance of the Synek scores calculated on (4-front)EEG and (std)EEG montage to predict outcomes (i.e., 28-day mortality and 90-day Rankin score >= 4) was investigated in a secondary exploratory analysis.ResultsThe detection of EEG patterns using (4-front)EEG was statistically similar to that of (std)EEG for background rhythm (Spearman rank test, rho =0.66, p<0.001), discontinuity (Cohen's kappa, <kappa>=0.955), reactivity (kappa =0.739) and the Synek's score (rho =0.794, p<0.001). Using the Synek classification, we found similar performances between (4-front)EEG and (std)EEG montages in predicting 28-day mortality (AUC (4-front)EEG 0.71, AUC (std)EEG 0.68) and for 90-day poor neurologic outcome (AUC (4-front)EEG 0.71, AUC (std)EEG 0.66). An exploratory analysis confirmed that the Synek scores determined by 4 or 21 electrodes were independently associated with 28-day mortality and poor 90-day functional outcome.ConclusionIn adult patients under VA-ECMO, a simplified 4-frontal electrode EEG montage interpreted by an intensivist, detected common EEG patterns associated with poor outcomes, with a performance similar to that of a standard EEG montage interpreted by expert neurophysiologists. This simplified montage could be implemented as part of a multimodal evaluation for bedside prognostication.

User Adaptation to Closed-Loop Decoding of Motor Imagery Termination	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Decoding; Clocks; Electroencephalography; Microsoft Windows; Synchronization; Task analysis; Calibration; Brain&#8211; machine interface (BMI); EEG; motor imagery; motor termination; latency; decoding adaptation	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; FINGER MOVEMENT; CORTICAL AREAS; MU-RHYTHM; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ONSET; BAND	One of the most popular methods in non-invasive brain machine interfaces (BMI) relies on the decoding of sensorimotor rhythms associated to sustained motor imagery. Although motor imagery has been intensively studied, its termination is mostly neglected. Objective: Here, we provide insights in the decoding of motor imagery termination and investigate the use of such decoder in closed-loop BMI. Methods: Participants (N = 9) were asked to perform kinesthetic motor imagery of both hands simultaneously cued with a clock indicating the initiation and termination of the action. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, we built a decoder to detect the transition between event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization. Features for this decoder were correlates of motor termination in the upper mu and beta bands. Results: The decoder reached an accuracy of 76.2% (N = 9), revealing the high robustness of our approach. More importantly, this paper shows that the decoding of motor termination has an intrinsic latency mainly due to the delayed appearance of its correlates. Because the latency was consistent and thus predictable, users were able to compensate it after training. Conclusion: Using our decoding system, BMI users were able to adapt their behavior and modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to stop the device (clock) accurately on time. Significance: These results show the importance of closed-loop evaluations of BMI decoders and open new possibilities for BMI control using decoding of movement termination.

In this analysis, EEG signals are collected with the g.Nautilus headset and analyzed through Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the EEG Lab. The experiment setup includes six stages, in the first step an image of the object is presented to the user for a few seconds and in the second stage, an image with an object name is presented to the user for the next few seconds. These two steps are repeated for a total of three shapes. Multiple ML algorithms are applied and evaluated to classify visual and written images examined by the user. Moreover, it is concluded that feature engineering, principal component analysis, and parameter tuning are crucial steps in Machine Learning to gain higher performance. The final results prove the capabilities of developing an Image Classification System with K-Nearest Neighbors and Brain-Computer Interface.

Precise diagnosis prior to the onset of the symptoms can prevent the rapid progression of the emerging cognitive impairment. Recent progress has shown that electroencephalography (EEG) is the promising and cost-effective test to facilitate the detection of neurocognitive disorders. However, most of the existing works have been using only resting-state EEG. The efficiencies of EEG signals from various cognitive tasks, for DEM classification, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we designed four cognitive tasks that engage different cognitive performances: attention, working memory, and executive function. We investigated these tasks by using statistical analysis on both time and frequency domains of EEG signals from three classes of human subjects: DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC). We also further evaluated the classification performances of two features extraction methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and filter hank common spatial pattern (FBCSP). We found that the working memoryrelated tasks yielded good performances for DEM recognition in both cases using PCA and FBCSP. Moreover, FBCSP with features combination from four tasks revealed the best sensitivity of 0.87 and the specificity of 0.80. To our hest knowledge, this is the first work that concurrently investigated several cognitive tasks for DEM recognition using both statistical analysis and classification scores. Our results yielded essential information to design and aid in conducting further experimental tasks to early diagnose DEM patients.

This study provides various intelligent deep learning (DL)-based methods for automated SZ diagnosis via electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The obtained results are compared with those of conventional intelligent methods. To implement the proposed methods, the dataset of the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw, Poland, has been used. First, EEG signals were divided into 25 s time frames and then were normalized by z-score or norm L2. In the classification step, two different approaches were considered for SZ diagnosis via EEG signals. In this step, the classification of EEG signals was first carried out by conventional machine learning methods, e.g., support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, naive Bayes, random forest, extremely randomized trees, and bagging. Various proposed DL models, namely, long short-term memories (LSTMs), one-dimensional convolutional networks (1D-CNNs), and 1D-CNN-LSTMs, were used in the following. In this step, the DL models were implemented and compared with different activation functions. Among the proposed DL models, the CNN-LSTM architecture has had the best performance. In this architecture, the ReLU activation function with the z-score and L2-combined normalization was used. The proposed CNN-LSTM model has achieved an accuracy percentage of 99.25%, better than the results of most former studies in this field. It is worth mentioning that to perform all simulations, the k-fold cross-validation method with k = 5 has been used.

To prevent healthy people from developing an alcohol use disorder, early detection is achieved using different screening methods. However, these methods are mostly based on self-tests, which can be easily influenced by the subject. In order to prevent healthy people from developing an alcohol use disorder through their alcohol consumption, drinking behavior, and alcohol-related problems, we propose a novel machine learning approach. With this approach it is possible to classify healthy people with an accuracy of 69 percent based on EEG recordings in assessing the danger of developing an alcohol use disorder or not. To obtain this result, the frequency range of the EEG data used was divided into 99 fine bands. Using a machine learning algorithm, the five most important bands were identified.

White matter tissue takes up approximately 50% of the human brain volume and it is widely known as a messenger conducting information between areas of the central nervous system. However, the characteristics of white matter neural activity and whether white matter neural recordings can contribute to movement decoding are often ignored and still remain largely unknown. In this work, we make quantitative analyses to investigate these two important questions using invasive neural recordings. Approach. We recorded stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) data from 32 human subjects during a visually-cued motor task, where SEEG recordings can tap into gray and white matter electrical activity simultaneously. Using the proximal tissue density method, we identified the location (i.e. gray or white matter) of each SEEG contact. Focusing on alpha oscillatory and high gamma activities, we compared the activation patterns between gray matter and white matter. Then, we evaluated the performance of such white matter activation in movement decoding. Main results. The results show that white matter also presents activation under the task, in a similar way with the gray matter but at a significantly lower amplitude. Additionally, this work also demonstrates that combing white matter neural activities together with that of gray matter significantly promotes the movement decoding accuracy than using gray matter signals only. Significance. Taking advantage of SEEG recordings from a large number of subjects, we reveal the response characteristics of white matter neural signals under the task and demonstrate its enhancing function in movement decoding. This study highlights the importance of taking white matter activities into consideration in further scientific research and translational applications.

J	Singh, A; Gumaste, A				Singh, Abhiram; Gumaste, Ashwin			Decoding Imagined Speech and Computer Control using Brain Waves	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Imagined speech; Artificial neural network; Electroencephalogram; Finite state machine; Brain-computer interface	EEG; CLASSIFICATION; INTERNET	Background: In this work, we explore the possibility of decoding Imagined Speech (IS) brain waves using machine learning techniques. Approach: We design two finite state machines to create an interface for controlling a computer system using an IS-based brain-computer interface. To decode IS signals, we propose a covariance matrix of Electroencephalogram channels as input features, covariance matrices projection to tangent space for obtaining vectors from matrices, principal component analysis for dimension reduction of vectors, an artificial neural network (ANN) as a classification model, and bootstrap aggregation for creating an ensemble of ANN models. Result: Based on these findings, we are first to use an IS-based system to operate a computer and obtain an information transfer rate of 21-bits-per-minute. The proposed approach can decode the IS signal with a mean classification accuracy of 85% on classifying one long vs. short word. Our proposed approach can also differentiate between IS and rest state brain signals with a mean classification accuracy of 94%. Comparison: After comparison, we show that our approach performs equivalent to the state-of-the-art approach (SOTA) on decoding long vs. short word classification task. We also show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA significantly on decoding three short words and vowels with an average margin of 11% and 9%, respectively. Conclusion: These results show that the proposed approach can decode a wide variety of IS signals and is practically applicable in a real-time environment.

Existing feature extraction methods cannot extract the deep concealed characteristics of EEG signals from different layers for efficient classification scheme and also hard to select appropriate and effective feature extraction methods for different types of EEG data. Hence this study intends to develop an efficient deep feature extraction based method to automatically classify emotion status of people. In order to discover reliable deep features, five deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) models are considered: AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, SqueezeNet and MobilNetv2. Pre-processing, Wavelet Transform (WT), and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) are employed to convert the EEG signals into EEG rhythm images then five well-known pretrained CNN models are employed for feature extraction. Finally, the proposed method puts the obtained features as input to the support vector machine (SVM) method for classifying them into binary emotion classes: valence and arousal classes.

While deep learning approaches have progressed substantially in terms of decoding accuracy, their power consumption is relatively high for mobile applications. Neuromorphic hardware arises as a promising solution to tackle this problem since it can run massive spiking neural networks with energy consumption orders of magnitude lower than traditional hardware. Herein, we show the viability of directly mapping a continuous-valued convolutional neural network for motor imagery EEG classification to a spiking neural network. The converted network, able to run on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic chip, only shows a 1.91% decrease in accuracy after conversion. Thus, we take full advantage of the benefits of both deep learning accuracies and low-power neuro-inspired hardware, properties that are key for the development of wearable BCI devices.

The most prominent techniques thus far attempt to improve the stimulus-response correlations using linear methods. In this paper, we propose a neural network based correlation analysis framework that significantly improves over the linear methods for auditory stimuli. A deep model is proposed for intra-subject audio-EEG analysis based on directly optimizing the correlation loss. Further, a neural network model with a shared encoder architecture is proposed for improving the inter-subject stimulus response correlations. These models attempt to suppress the EEG artifacts while preserving the components related to the stimulus. Several experiments are performed using EEG recordings from subjects listening to speech and music stimuli. In these experiments, we show that the deep models improve the Pearson correlation significantly over the linear methods (average absolute improvements of 7.4% in speech tasks and 29.3% in music tasks). We also analyze the impact of several model parameters on the stimulus-response correlation.

In this paper, we develop a novel eye blink artifact detection algorithm based on optimally selected multi-dimensional EEG features. Specific efforts have been paid to filtering the frontal epileptiform discharges, where an unsupervised learning exploiting the EEG signal physiological characteristics and smooth nonlinear energy operator (SNEO) based on the K-means clustering has been firstly proposed. Multiple statistical EEG features derived from the frontal electrodes and other electrodes are then extracted to characterize eye blink artifacts. Discriminative feature selection scheme based on the variance filtering and Relief algorithms has been respectively studied, and the average correlation coefficient (ACC) is applied for feature optimization evaluation. The eye blink artifact detection is finally achieved based on the support vector machine (SVM) trained on the optimized EEG features. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by experiments carried out on the EEG database of 11 subjects recorded from the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (CHZU). Comparisons to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) eye blink artifact detection methods are also presented.

To accomplish this in real-time, a conventional Yule-Walker (YW)-based autoregressive (AR) model has been used. However, the brain state-dependent real-time implementation of a closed-loop system employing an adaptive method has not yet been explored. Our primary purpose was to investigate whether time-series forward prediction using an adaptive least mean square (LMS)-based AR model would be implementable in a real-time closed-loop system or not. EEG state-dependent triggers synchronized with the EEG peaks and troughs of alpha oscillations in both an open-eyes resting state and a visual task. For the resting and visual conditions, statistical results showed that the proposed method succeeded in giving triggers at a specific phase of EEG oscillations for all participants. These individual results showed that the LMS-based AR model was successfully implemented in a real-time closed-loop system targeting specific phases of alpha oscillations and can be used as an adaptive alternative to the conventional and machine-learning approaches with a low computational load.

In view of the characteristics of nonstationarity, time-variability, and individual diversity of EEG signals, a deep learning framework termed SSD-SE-convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for MI-EEG classification. The framework consists of three parts: 1) the sparse spectrotemporal decomposition (SSD) algorithm is proposed for feature extraction, overcoming the drawbacks of conventional time-frequency analysis methods and enhancing the robustness to noise; 2) a CNN is constructed to fully exploit the time-frequency features, thus outperforming traditional classification methods both in terms of accuracy and kappa value; and 3) the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks are adopted to adaptively recalibrate channelwise feature responses, which further improves the overall performance and offers a compelling classification solution for MI-EEG applications. Experimental results on two datasets reveal that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both classification quality and robustness. The advantages of SSD-SE-CNN include high accuracy, high efficiency, and robustness to cross-trial and cross-session variations, making it an ideal candidate for long-term MI-EEG applications. Note to Practitioners-Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) are widely used to allow a user to control a device using only his or her neural activity. This article proposed a new framework to classify two-class MI tasks based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this framework, a new sparse spectrotemporal decomposition method is used to extract time-frequency features from EEG signals. A convolutional neural network with squeeze-and-excitation blocks is then constructed to classify the MI tasks. We show the superiority of our method on two datasets and prove its feasibility for long-term MI-BCI applications.

Our dataset was recorded from 270 healthy subjects during silent speech of eight different Russia words (commands): 'forward', 'backward', 'up', 'down', 'help', 'take', 'stop', and 'release', and one pseudoword. We began by demonstrating that silent word distributions can be very close statistically and that there are words describing directed movements that share similar patterns of brain activity. However, after training one individual, we achieved 85% accuracy performing 9 words (including pseudoword) classification and 88% accuracy on binary classification on average. We show that a smaller dataset collected on one participant allows for building a more accurate classifier for a given subject than a larger dataset collected on a group of people. At the same time, we show that the learning outcomes on a limited sample of EEG-data are transferable to the general population. Thus, we demonstrate the possibility of using selected command-words to create an EEG-based input device for people on whom the neural network classifier has not been trained, which is particularly important for people with disabilities.

However, current manual sleep stage labeling by trained experts involves heavy labour intensity. Furthermore, previous models regarding the automation of sleep stage classification using machine learning are highly susceptible to class imbalance problem, which is prevalent in polysomnography recordings. This study proposes an automated sleep stage classification method based on data augmentation via spectral band blending to address class imbalance problem, and thereby improving the performance of machine learning models for sleep stage classification. In this endeavour, EEG recordings from 153 healthy subjects were utilized to develop the EEGNet-BiLSTM as the baseline model. When compared the performance of sleep stage classification between EEGNet-BiLSTM with and without data augmentation, EEGNet-BiLSTM without data augmentation yielded approximately 82% accuracy and 0.70 kappa-value, whereas the proposed method showed 87% accuracy and 0.73 kappa-value. Our proposed method, EEGNet-BiLSTM with data augmentation, is superior in terms of accuracy and consistency compared to the conventional baseline model.

In recent studies, MI-EEG has been used in the rehabilitation process of paralyzed patients, therefore, decoding MI-EEG signals accurately is an important task, and it is difficult task due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the variation of brain waves between subjects. Deep learning techniques such as the convolution neural network (CNN) have shown an impact in extracting meaningful features to improve the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we propose TCNet-Fusion, a fixed hyperparameter-based CNN model that utilizes multiple techniques, such as temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), separable convolution, depthwise convolution, and the fusion of layers. This model outperforms other fixed hyperparameter-based CNN models while remaining similar to those that utilize variable hyperparameter networks, which are networks that change their hyperparameters based on each subject, resulting in higher accuracy than fixed networks. It also uses less memory than variable networks. The EEG signal undergoes two successive 1D convolutions, first along with the time domain, then channel-wise. Then, we obtain an image-like representation, which is fed to the main TCN. During experimentation, the model achieved a classification accuracy of 83.73 % on the four-class MI of the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset, and an accuracy of 94.41 % on the High Gamma Dataset.

To enable an intuitive motor imagery (MI) paradigm of "left," "right," "push," and "pull," a driving simulator based EEG data recording and automatic labeling platform is built for dataset making. In the preprocessing stage, a wavelet and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) combined method is used for artifact removal and improving signal-to-noise ratio. An ensemble learning based training and testing framework is proposed for MI EEG data classification. The average classification accuracy of proposed framework is about 91.75%. This approach essentially takes advantage of the common spatial pattern (CSP) with ability of extracting the feature of event-related potentials and the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with powerful capacity of feature learning and classification. To convert the classification results of EEG data segments into motion control signals of ground vehicle, shared control strategy is used to realize the control command of "left-steering," "right-steering," "acceleration," and "stop" considering collision avoidance with obstacles detected by a single-line LIDAR. The online experimental results on a model vehicle platform validate the significant performance of the established BCI system and reveal the application potential of BCI on the vehicle control and automation.

J	Cho, JH; Jeong, JH; Lee, SW				Cho, Jeong-Hyun; Jeong, Ji-Hoon; Lee, Seong-Whan			NeuroGrasp: Real-Time EEG Classification of High-Level Motor Imagery Tasks Using a Dual-Stage Deep Learning Framework	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article; Early Access						Electroencephalography; Decoding; Task analysis; Deep learning; Protocols; Electromyography; Muscles; Brain-computer interface (BCI); deep learning; electroencephalogram; high-level tasks; motor imagery (MI); real-time classification	SUBJECT; ALGORITHMS; SYNERGIES; NETWORKS; ENSEMBLE	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been widely employed to identify and estimate a user's intention to trigger a robotic device by decoding motor imagery (MI) from an electroencephalogram (EEG). However, developing a BCI system driven by MI related to natural hand-grasp tasks is challenging due to its high complexity. Although numerous BCI studies have successfully decoded large body parts, such as the movement intention of both hands, arms, or legs, research on MI decoding of high-level behaviors such as hand grasping is essential to further expand the versatility of MI-based BCIs. In this study, we propose NeuroGrasp, a dual-stage deep learning framework that decodes multiple hand grasping from EEG signals under the MI paradigm. The proposed method effectively uses an EEG and electromyography (EMG)-based learning, such that EEG-based inference at test phase becomes possible. The EMG guidance during model training allows BCIs to predict hand grasp types from EEG signals accurately. Consequently, NeuroGrasp improved classification performance offline, and demonstrated a stable classification performance online. Across 12 subjects, we obtained an average offline classification accuracy of 0.68 (+/- 0.09) in four-grasp-type classifications and 0.86 (+/- 0.04) in two-grasp category classifications. In addition, we obtained an average online classification accuracy of 0.65 (+/- 0.09) and 0.79 (+/- 0.09) across six high-performance subjects. Because the proposed method has demonstrated a stable classification performance when evaluated either online or offline, in the future, we expect that the proposed method could contribute to different BCI applications, including robotic hands or neuroprosthetics for handling everyday objects.

The mental tasks are dominant area of investigations in BCI, which utmost interest as these system can be augmented life of people having severe disabilities. The performance of BCI model primarily depends on the construction of features from brain, electroencephalography (EEG), signal, and the size of feature vector, which are obtained through multiple channels. The availability of training samples to features are minimal for mental task classification. The feature selection is used to increase the ratio for the mental task classification by getting rid of irrelevant and superfluous features. This paper suggests an approach to augment the performance of a learning algorithm for the mental task classification on the utility of power spectral density (PSD) using feature selection. This paper also deals a comparative analysis of multivariate and univariate feature selection for mental task classification. After applying the above stated method, the findings demonstrate substantial improvements in the performance of learning model for mental task classification. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed approach is endorsed by carrying out a robust ranking algorithm and Friedman's statistical test for finding the best combinations and compare various combinations of PSD and feature selection methods.

Even though the brain activities during tasks (i.e., P300 activities) are considered as biomarkers to diagnose schizophrenia, brain activities at rest have the potential to show an inherent dysfunctionality in schizophrenia and can be used to understand the cognitive deficits in these patients. In this study, we developed a machine learning algorithm (MLA) based on eyes closed resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets, which record the neural activity in the absence of any tasks or external stimuli given to the subjects, aiming to distinguish schizophrenic patients (SCZs) from healthy controls (HCs). The MLA has two steps. In the first step, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), which is a measure of effective connectivity, is applied to resting-state EEG data. In the second step, the MLA uses the STE matrix to find a set of features that can successfully discriminate SCZ from HC. From the results, we found that the MLA could achieve a total accuracy of 96.92%, with a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 98.57%, precision of 98.33%, F1-score of 0.97, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.94 using only 10 out of 1900 STE features, which implies that the STE matrix extracted from resting-state EEG data may be a promising tool for the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia.

That the classification model should be retrained from scratch for a new subject often leads to unnecessary time consumption. In this paper, a "brain-ID" framework based on the hybrid deep neural network with transfer learning (HDNN-TL) is proposed to deal with individual differences of 4-class MI task. An end-to-end HDNN is developed to learn the common features of MI signal. HDNN consists of convolutional neural network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which are utilized to decode the spatial and temporal features of the MI signal simultaneously. To deal with the EEG individual differences problem, transfer learning technique is implemented to fine-tune the followed fully connected (FC) layer to accommodate new subject with fewer training data. The classification performance on BCI competition IV dataset 2a by the proposed HDNN-TL in terms of kappa value is 0.8. We compared HDNN-TL, HDNN and other state-of-art methods and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can get a satisfying result for new subjects with less time and fewer training data in MI task.

Combining the group sparsity and spatial smoothness of EEG signals, a new EEG classification model is proposed, which is an improvement of group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We call it fused group LASSO. First, group LASSO is used to model the group sparsity of EEG signals, the features of the same channel are assigned the same weights. Then, based on group LASSO, channel weights are regularized by total variation norm (TV-norm), which constrains the weights of adjacent channels to the same or similar, thereby the spatial smoothness modeling of EEG signals can be achieved. Using the primal-dual theory, an optimization algorithm for the new model is given. In order to verify the effectiveness of the new model, experiments were performed on two public brain-computer interface (BCI) competition data sets and one self-collected data set. Compared with the existing sparse optimization methods, the proposed method has achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 79.24%, 86.64% and 81.09%, respectively, and with better physiological interpretability. Compared with spatial filtering methods with smooth constraints, the proposed method realized global spatial smooth in a data-driver manner, and achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 84.96% in two competition data sets. All the experimental results showed that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of BCI systems.

J	Sharma, S; Khare, SK; Bajaj, V; Ansari, IA				Sharma, Sachin; Khare, Smith K.; Bajaj, Varun; Ansari, Irshad Ahmad			Improving the separability of drowsiness and alert EEG signals using analytic form of wavelet transform	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Decomposition; Flexible Analytic Wavelet Transform; Machine Learning; Drowsiness Detection	CLASSIFICATION	Drowsiness is a state in which individual decision-making ability is declined. Drowsy driving is one of the key factors for worldwide accidents which claim many lives, causing injuries and permanent disability. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the most common source used for the detection of drowsiness because of changes in neuron behavior. More hidden information can be obtained if it is decomposed into multi-components. Therefore, a flexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT) based drowsiness detection is explored in this paper. FAWT decomposes a signal in multi-frequency subbands. Multiple features are extracted from these subbands and selected using statistical analysis. Different classification techniques are employed to separate drowsy and alert signals. An accuracy of 95.6%, a sensitivity of 95.2%, a specificity of 98.6%, a precision of 99.1%, and 96.1% of area under the curve are achieved with an extreme learning machine classifier. This shows that our developed method can find more hidden information which is helpful for accurate detection of drowsiness. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Impacts of electrode montages and bandwidth are also reported. The perspective of this work is to improve the detection of intraoperative awareness during general anesthesia. Methods: Various architectures of EEGNet were investigated to optimize MI detection. They have been compared to the state-of-the-art classifiers in Brain-Computer Interfaces (based on Riemannian geometry, linear discriminant analysis), and other deep learning architectures (deep convolution network, shallow convolutional network). EEG data were measured from 22 participants performing motor imagery with and without median nerve stimulation. Results: The proposed architecture of EEGNet reaches the best classification accuracy (83.2%) and false-positive rate (FPR 19.0%) for a setup with only six electrodes over the motor cortex and frontal lobe and for an extended 4-38 Hz EEG frequency range while the subject is being stimulated via a median nerve. Configurations with a larger number of electrodes result in higher accuracy (94.5%) and FPR (6.1%) for 128 electrodes (and respectively 88.0% and 12.9% for 13 electrodes). Conclusion: The present work demonstrates that using an extended EEG frequency band and a modified EEGNet deep neural network increases the accuracy of MI detection when used with as few as 6 electrodes which include frontal channels. Significance: The proposed method contributes to the development of Brain-Computer Interface systems based on MI detection from EEG.

Action intention understanding EEG signal classification is indispensable for investigating human-computer interactions and intention understanding mechanisms. Numerous investigations on classification tasks extract classification features by using graph theory metrics; however, the classification results are usually not good. Method. To effectively implement the task of action intention understanding EEG signal classification, we proposed a new feature extraction method by improving discriminative spatial patterns. Results. The whole frequency band and fusion band achieved satisfactory classification accuracies. Compared with other authors' methods for action intention understanding EEG signal classification, the new method performs more satisfactorily in some aspects. Conclusions. The new feature extraction method not only effectively avoids complex values when solving the generalized eigenvalue problem but also perfectly realizes appreciable classification accuracies. Fusing the classification features of different frequency bands is a useful strategy for the classification task.

To the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of anxiety state is still based on some subjective questionnaires and there is no objective standard assessment yet. Unlike other methods, our approach focuses on study the neural changes to identify and classify the anxiety state using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Methods We designed a closed neurofeedback experiment that contains three experimental stages to adjust subjects' mental state. The EEG resting state signal was recorded from thirty-four subjects in the first and third stages while EEG-based mindfulness recording was recorded in the second stage. At the end of each stage, the subjects were asked to fill a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). According to their VAS score, the subjects were classified into three groups: non-anxiety, moderate or severe anxiety groups. Results After processing the EEG data of each group, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were able to classify and identify two mental states (non-anxiety and anxiety) using the Power Spectral Density (PSD) as patterns. The highest classification accuracies using Gaussian kernel function and polynomial kernel function are 92.48 +/- 1.20% and 88.60 +/- 1.32%, respectively. The highest average of the classification accuracies for healthy subjects is 95.31 +/- 1.97% and for anxiety subjects is 87.18 +/- 3.51%. Conclusions The results suggest that our proposed EEG neurofeedback-based classification approach is efficient for developing affective BCI system for detection and evaluation of anxiety disorder states.

Brain-computer Interface (BCI) systems rely on EEG analysis to identify the mental state of the user, change in cognitive state and response to the events. Motor Execution (ME) is a very important control paradigm. This paper introduces a robust and useful User-Independent Hybrid Brain-computer Interface (UIHBCI) model to classify signals from fourteen EEG channels that are used to record the reactions of the brain neurons of nine subjects. Through this study the researchers identified relevant multisensory features of multi-channel EEG that represent the specific mental processes depending on two different evaluation models (Audio/Video) and (Male/Female). The Deep Belief Network (DBN) was applied independently on the two models where, the overall achieved classification rates were better in ME classification compared to the state of art. For evaluation four models were tested in addition to the proposed model, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Brain-computer Interface Lower-Limb Motor Recovery (BCI LLMR) and Hybrid Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Brain-computer Interface (Hybrid SSVEP-RSVP BCI). Results indicated the proposed model, LDA, SVM, BCI LLMR and Hybrid SSVEP-RSVP BCI accuracies for (A/V) model are 94.44%, 66.67%, 61.11%, 83.33% and 89.67% respectively, while for (M/F) model, the overall accuracies are 94.44%, 88.89%, 83.331%, 85.44% and 89.45%. Finally, the proposed model achieved superiority over the state of art algorithms in both (A/V) and (M/F) models.

However, the complexity of this brain process makes the analysis and classification of this type of signals a relevant topic of research. The goals of this study were: to develop a new algorithm based on Deep Learning (DL), referred to as CNNeeg1-1, to recognize EEG signals in imagined vowel tasks; to create an imagined speech database with 50 subjects specialized in imagined vowels from the Spanish language (/a/,/e/,/i/,/o/,/u/); and to contrast the performance of the CNNeeg1-1 algorithm with the DL Shallow CNN and EEGNet benchmark algorithms using an open access database (BD1) and the newly developed database (BD2). In this study, a mixed variance analysis of variance was conducted to assess the intra-subject and inter-subject training of the proposed algorithms. The results show that for intra-subject training analysis, the best performance among the Shallow CNN, EEGNet, and CNNeeg1-1 methods in classifying imagined vowels (/a/,/e/,/i/,/o/,/u/) was exhibited by CNNeeg1-1, with an accuracy of 65.62% for BD1 database and 85.66% for BD2 database.

The main challenge in this area is to achieve real-time and accurate bio-signal processing for pattern recognition, especially in Motor Imagery (MI). The significant interaction between brain signals and controllable machines requires instantaneous brain data decoding. In this study, an embedded BCI system based on fist MI signals is developed. It uses an Emotiv EPOC+ Brainwear(R), an Altera SoCKit(R) development board, and a hexapod robot for testing locomotion imagery commands. The system is tested to detect the imagined movements of closing and opening the left and right hand to control the robot locomotion. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals associated with the motion tasks are sensed on the human sensorimotor cortex. Next, the SoCKit processes the data to identify the commands allowing the controlled robot locomotion. The classification of MI-EEG signals from the F3, F4, FC5, and FC6 sensors is performed using a hybrid architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This method takes advantage of the deep learning recognition model to develop a real-time embedded BCI system, where signal processing must be seamless and precise. The proposed method is evaluated using k-fold cross-validation on both created and public Scientific-Data datasets. Our dataset is comprised of 2400 trials obtained from four test subjects, lasting three seconds of closing and opening fist movement imagination. The recognition tasks reach 84.69% and 79.2% accuracy using our data and a state-of-the-art dataset, respectively. Numerical results support that the motor imagery EEG signals can be successfully applied in BCI systems to control mobile robots and related applications such as intelligent vehicles.

As such, it studies the neural activity associated with preference and purchase intent. Neuromarketing is considered an emerging area of research, driven in part by the approximately 400 billion dollars spent annually on advertisement and promotion. Given the size of this market, even a slight improvement in performance can have an immense impact. Traditional approaches to marketing consider a posteriori user feedback in the form of questionnaires, product ratings, or review comments, but these approaches do not fully capture or explain the real-time decision-making process of consumers. Various physiological measurement techniques have been proposed to facilitate the recording of this crucial aspect of the decision-making process, including brain imaging techniques [functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), steady state topography (SST)], and various biometric sensors. The use of EEG in neuromarketing is especially promising. EEG detects the sequential changes of brain activity, without appreciable time delay, needed to assess both the unconscious reaction and sensory reaction of the customer. Several types of EEG devices are now available in the market, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Researchers have conducted experiments using many of these devices, across different age groups and different categories of products. Because of the deep insights that can be gained, the field of neuromarketing research is carefully monitored by consumer and research protection groups to ensure that subjects are properly protected. This article surveys a range of considerations for EEG-based neuromarketing strategies, including the types of information that can be gathered, how marketing stimuli are presented to consumers, how such strategies may affect the consumer in terms of appeal and memory, machine learning techniques applied in the field, and the variety of challenges faced, including ethics, in this emerging field.

Diagnosis of epileptic seizures is commonly performed on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and by using computer-aided diagnosis systems (CADS), neurologists can diagnose epileptic seizure stages more accurately. In these systems, a mandatory stage is feature extraction, performed by handcrafting features or learning them, ordinarily by a deep neural net. While researches in this field commonly show the value of a group of limited features, yet an accurate comparison between different suggested features is essential. In this article, first, a comparison between the importance of 50 different handcrafted features for seizure detection is presented. Additionally, the computational complexity of features is investigated as well. Then the best features based on Fisher scores are picked to classify signals on a benchmark dataset for evaluation. Additionally, a convolutional autoencoder with five layers is applied to learn features in order to have a complete comparison among feature extraction approaches. Finally, a hybrid method is employed, which combines handcrafted features and encoding of autoencoder to reach high performance in seizure detection in EEG signals.

Whereas electroencephalography has been known to be effective for the detection of seizure liability, no established methods are available for the detection of seizure auras. We developed a method for detecting seizure auras through machine learning using frequency-characteristic images of electroencephalograms. Histograms of frequency-intensity distribution prepared from electroencephalograms of rats analyzed during seizures induced with 4-aminopyridine (6 mg/ kg), strychnine (3 mg/kg), and pilocarpine (400 mg/kg), were used to create an artificial intelligence (AI) system that learned the features of frequency-characteristic images during seizures. The AI system detected seizure states learned in advance with 100% accuracy induced even by convulsants acting through different mechanisms, and the risk of seizure before a seizure was detected in general observation. The developed AI system determined that the unlearned convulsant Tramadol (150 mg/kg) was the risk of seizure and the negative compounds aspirin and vehicle were negative. Moreover, the AI system detected seizure liability even in electroencephalography data associated with the use of 4-aminopyridine (3 mg/kg), strychnine (1 mg/kg), and pilocarpine (150 mg/kg), which did not induce seizures detectable in general observation. These results suggest that the AI system developed herein is an effective means for electroencephalographic detection of seizure auras, raising expectations for its practical use as a new analytical method that allows for the sensitive detection of seizure liability of drugs that has been overlooked previously in preclinical studies.

Herein, an approach for synthesizing vowel sounds straightforwardly from scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG), a noninvasive neurophysiological recording method is demonstrated. Given cortical current signals derived from the EEG acquired while human participants listen to and recall (i.e., imagined) two vowels, /a/ and /i/, sound parameters are estimated by a convolutional neural network (CNN). The speech synthesized from the estimated parameters is sufficiently natural to achieve recognition rates >85% during a subsequent sound discrimination task. Notably, the CNN identifies the involvement of the brain areas mediating the "what" auditory stream, namely the superior, middle temporal, and Heschl's gyri, demonstrating the efficacy of the computational method in extracting auditory-related information from neuroelectrical activity. Differences in cortical sound representation between listening versus recalling are further revealed, such that the fusiform, calcarine, and anterior cingulate gyri contributes during listening, whereas the inferior occipital gyrus is engaged during recollection. The proposed approach can expand the scope of EEG in decoding auditory perception that requires high spatial and temporal resolution.

Nonetheless, owing to high intra- and inter-subject variabilities, many studies on decoding EEG were designed in a subject-specific manner by using calibration samples, with no concern of its practical use, hampered by time-consuming steps and a large data requirement. To this end, recent studies adopted a transfer learning strategy, especially domain adaptation techniques. Among those, we have witnessed the potential of adversarial learning-based transfer learning in BCIs. In the meantime, it is known that adversarial learning-based domain adaptation methods are prone to negative transfer that disrupts learning generalized feature representations, applicable to diverse domains, for example, subjects or sessions in BCIs. In this article, we propose a novel framework that learns class-relevant and subject-invariant feature representations in an information-theoretic manner, without using adversarial learning. To be specific, we devise two operational components in a deep network that explicitly estimate mutual information between feature representations: 1) to decompose features in an intermediate layer into class-relevant and class-irrelevant ones and 2) to enrich class-discriminative feature representation. On two large EEG datasets, we validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework by comparing with several comparative methods in performance. Furthermore, we conducted rigorous analyses by performing an ablation study in regard to the components in our network, explaining our model's decision on input EEG signals via layer-wise relevance propagation, and visualizing the distribution of learned features via t-SNE.

Here, we investigated brain phenotyping in patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) by using electroencephalography (EEG) and conducted machine-learning-based classification of the two diseases by using EEG components. Materials and Methods: We enrolled healthy controls (HCs) (n = 30) and patients with SZ (n = 34) and MDD (n = 33). An auditory P300 (AP300) task was performed, and the N1 and P3 components were extracted. Two-group classification was conducted using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Positive and negative symptoms and depression and/or anxiety symptoms were evaluated. Results: Considering both the results of statistical comparisons and machine learning-based classifications, patients and HCs showed significant differences in AP300, with SZ and MDD showing lower N1 and P3 than HCs. In the sum of amplitudes and cortical sources, the findings for LDA with classification accuracy (SZ vs. HCs: 71.31%, MDD vs. HCs: 74.55%), sensitivity (SZ vs. HCs: 77.67%, MDD vs. HCs: 79.00%), and specificity (SZ vs. HCs: 64.00%, MDD vs. HCs: 69.67%) supported these results. The SVM classifier showed reasonable scores between SZ and HCs and/or MDD and HCs. The comparison between SZ and MDD showed low classification accuracy (59.71%), sensitivity (65.08%), and specificity (54.83%). Conclusions: Patients with SZ and MDD showed deficiencies in N1 and P3 components in the sum of amplitudes and cortical sources, indicating attentional dysfunction in both early and late sensory/cognitive gating input. The LDA and SVM classifiers in the AP300 are useful to distinguish patients with SZ and HCs and/or MDD and HCs.

These intentions are hence classified as different cognitive tasks, e.g. left and right hand movements. A challenge in developing a BCI is handling the high dimensionality of the data recorded from multichannel EEG signals which are highly subject-specific. Designing a portable BCI whilst minimizing EEG channel number is a challenge. To this end, this paper presents a method to reduce the channel count with the goal of reducing computational complexity whilst maintaining a sufficient level of accuracy, by utilising an automatic subject-specific channel selection method created using the Pearson correlation coefficient. This method computes the correlation between EEG signals and helps to select highly correlated EEG channels for a particular subject without compromising classification accuracy (CA). Common spatial patterns (CSP) are used to analyse imagined left and right hand movements and the method is evaluated on both BCI Competition III Dataset IIIa and right hand and foot imagined tasks on BCI Competition III Dataset IVa. For both datasets, a minimum number of EEG channels are identified with an average channel reduction of 65.45% whilst demonstrating an increase of >5% in CA using channel Cz as a reference.

J	Kim, K; Duc, NT; Choi, M; Lee, B				Kim, Kyungwon; Nguyen Thanh Duc; Choi, Min; Lee, Boreom			EEG microstate features for schizophrenia classification	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CONNECTIVITY ALTERATIONS; SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; RESTING EEG; BRAIN; EMOTION; NETWORK; NAIVE; TIME	Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis is a method wherein spontaneous EEG activity is segmented at sub-second levels to analyze quasi-stable states. In particular, four archetype microstates and their features are known to reflect changes in brain state in neuropsychiatric diseases. However, previous studies have only reported differences in each microstate feature and have not determined whether microstate features are suitable for schizophrenia classification. Therefore, it is necessary to validate microstate features for schizophrenia classification. Nineteen microstate features, including duration, occurrence, and coverage as well as thirty-one conventional EEG features, including statistical, frequency, and temporal characteristics were obtained from resting-state EEG recordings of 14 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and from 14 healthy (control) subjects. Machine-learning based multivariate analysis was used to evaluate classification performance. EEG recordings of patients and controls showed different microstate features. More importantly, when differentiating among patients and controls, EEG microstate features outperformed conventional EEG ones. The performance of the microstate features exceeded that of conventional EEG, even after optimization using recursive feature elimination. EEG microstate features applied with conventional EEG features also showed better classification performance than conventional EEG features alone. The current study is the first to validate the use of microstate features to discriminate schizophrenia, suggesting that EEG microstate features are useful for schizophrenia classification.

Rajendra			Automatic Sleep-Stage Scoring in Healthy and Sleep Disorder Patients Using Optimal Wavelet Filter Bank Technique with EEG Signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						sleep stage; classification; electroencephalogram (EEG); polysomnogram (PSG); wavelet filters; sleep disorders	CLASSIFICATION; DESIGN; TRANSFORM; FEATURES; BEHAVIOR; DISEASE	Sleep stage classification plays a pivotal role in effective diagnosis and treatment of sleep related disorders. Traditionally, sleep scoring is done manually by trained sleep scorers. The analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded during sleep by clinicians is tedious, time-consuming and prone to human errors. Therefore, it is clinically important to score sleep stages using machine learning techniques to get accurate diagnosis. Several studies have been proposed for automated detection of sleep stages. However, these studies have employed only healthy normal subjects (good sleepers). The proposed study focuses on the automated sleep-stage scoring of subjects suffering from seven different kind of sleep disorders such as insomnia, bruxism, narcolepsy, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE), periodic leg movement (PLM), rapid eye movement (REM) behavioural disorder and sleep-disordered breathing as well as normal subjects. The open source physionet's cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) sleep database is used for this study. The EEG epochs are decomposed into sub-bands using a new class of optimized wavelet filters. Two EEG channels, namely F4-C4 and C4-A1, combined are used for this work as they can provide more insights into the changes in EEG signals during sleep. The norm features are computed from six sub-bands coefficients of optimal wavelet filter bank and fed to various supervised machine learning classifiers. We have obtained the highest classification performance using an ensemble of bagged tree (EBT) classifier with 10-fold cross validation. The CAP database comprising of 80 subjects is divided into ten different subsets and then ten different sleep-stage scoring tasks are performed. Since, the CAP database is unbalanced with different duration of sleep stages, the balanced dataset also has been created using over-sampling and under-sampling techniques. The highest average accuracy of 85.3% and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.786 and accuracy of 92.8% and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.915 are obtained for unbalanced and balanced databases, respectively. The proposed method can reliably classify the sleep stages using single or dual channel EEG epochs of 30 s duration instead of using multimodal polysomnography (PSG) which are generally used for sleep-stage scoring. Our developed automated system is ready to be tested with more sleep EEG data and can be employed in various sleep laboratories to evaluate the quality of sleep in various sleep disorder patients and normal subjects.

Modern machine-learning methods help us to extract information from EEG recordings and therefore several brain-computer interface (BCI) systems use them in clinical applications. By processing the publicly available PhysioNet EEG dataset, we extracted information that could be used for training feedforward neural network to classify three types of activities performed by 109 volunteers. While volunteers were performing different activities, a BCI2000 system was recording their EEG signals from 64 electrodes. We used motor imagery runs where a target appeared on either the top or the bottom of a screen. The subject was instructed to imagine opening and closing either both his/her fists (if the target is on top) or both his/her feet (if the target is on the bottom) until the target disappears from the screen. We used the EEGLAB Matlab toolbox for EEG signal processing and applied several feature extraction techniques. Then we evaluated the classification performance of feedforward, multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks with different structures (number of layers, number of neurons). Achieved accuracy score for test data was 71.5%.

We here probed the link between emotional arousal, a fundamental property of affective experience, and parieto-occipital alpha power under naturalistic stimulation: 37 young healthy adults completed an immersive VR experience, which included rollercoaster rides, while their EEG was recorded. They then continuously rated their subjective emotional arousal while viewing a replay of their experience. The association between emotional arousal and parieto-occipital alpha power was tested and confirmed by (1) decomposing the continuous EEG signal while maximizing the comodulation between alpha power and arousal ratings and by (2) decoding periods of high and low arousal with discriminative common spatial patterns and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network. We successfully combine EEG and a naturalistic immersive VR experience to extend previous findings on the neurophysiology of emotional arousal towards real-world neuroscience. eLife digest Human emotions are complex and difficult to study. It is particularly difficult to study emotional arousal, this is, how engaging, motivating, or intense an emotional experience is. To learn how the human brain processes emotions, researchers usually show emotional images to participants in the laboratory while recording their brain activity. But viewing sequences of photos is not quite like experiencing the dynamic and interactive emotions people face in everyday life. New technologies, such as immersive virtual reality, allow individuals to experience dynamic and interactive situations, giving scientists the opportunity to study human emotions in more realistic settings. These tools could lead to new insights regarding emotions and emotional arousal. Hofmann, Klotzsche, Mariola et al. show that virtual reality can be a useful tool for studying emotions and emotional arousal. In the experiment, 37 healthy young adults put on virtual reality glasses and 'experienced' two virtual rollercoaster rides. During the virtual rides, Hofmann, Klotzsche, Mariola et al. measured the participants' brain activity using a technique called electroencephalography (EEG). Then, the participants rewatched their rides and rated how emotionally arousing each moment was. Three different computer modeling techniques were then used to predict the participant's emotional arousal based on their brain activity. The experiments confirmed the results of traditional laboratory experiments and showed that the brain's alpha waves can be used to predict emotional arousal. This suggests that immersive virtual reality is a useful tool for studying human emotions in circumstances that are more like everyday life. This may make future discoveries about human emotions more useful for real-life applications such as mental health care.

Motivated by the paradigm shift of edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) for continuous monitoring, we focus on this paper on the first step to carry out EEG edge analytics at the last frontier (i.e., the ultra-edge) of our considered cyber-physical system for ensuring users' convenience and privacy. To overcome challenges due to computational and energy resource constraints of IoT devices (e.g., EEG headbands/headsets), in this paper, we envision a smart, lightweight model, referred to as Logic-in-Headbands based Edge Analytics (LiHEA), which can be seamlessly incorporated with the consumer-grade EEG headsets to reduce delay and bandwidth consumption. By systematically investigating various traditional machine and deep learning models, we identify and select the best model for our envisioned LiHEA. We consider a use-case for detecting confusion, representing levels of distraction, during online course delivery which has become pervasive during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We apply a unique feature selection technique to find out which features are triggered with confusion where delta waves, attention, and theta waves were announced as the three most important features. Among various traditional machine and deep learning models, our customized random forest model demonstrated the highest accuracy of 90%. Since the dataset size might have impacted the performance of deep learning-based approaches, we further apply the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic traces with representative samples of the original EEG data, and thereby enhance the variation in the data. While the performances of the deep learning models significantly increase after the data augmentation, they still cannot outperform the random forest model. Furthermore, computational complexity analysis is performed for the three best-performing algorithms, and random forest emerges as the most viable model for our envisioned LiHEA.

To this end, cortical EEG source signals in the motor cortex (evaluated in the 1-s window preceding movement onset) are extracted by solving inverse problem through beamforming. EEG sources epochs are used as source-time maps input to a custom deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to perform 2-ways classification tasks: pre-hand close (HC) versus resting state (RE) and pre-hand open (HO) versus RE. The developed deep CNN works well (accuracy rates up to 89.65 +/- 5.29% for HC versus RE and 90.50 +/- 5.35% for HO versus RE), but the core of the present study was to explore the interpretability of the deep CNN to provide further insights into the activation mechanism of cortical sources during the preparation of hands' sub-movements. Specifically, occlusion sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate which cortical areas are more relevant in the classification procedure. Experimental results show a recurrent trend of spatial cortical activation across subjects. In particular, the central region (close to the longitudinal fissure) and the right temporal zone of the premotor together with the primary motor cortex appear to be primarily involved. Such findings encourage an in-depth study of cortical areas that seem to play a key role in hand's open/close preparation.

We hypothesize that the stress wave generated by laser-induced plasma in the air can propagate through the air to reach the nearby human skin and evoke tactile sensation. To validate this hypothesis, we investigated somatosensory responses in the human brain to laser plasma stimuli by analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) in 14 participants. Three types of stimuli were provided to the index finger: a plasma stimulus induced from the laser, a mechanical stimulus transferred through Styrofoam stick, and a sham stimulus providing only the sound of the plasma and mechanical stimuli at the same time. The event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/S) of sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) in EEG was analyzed. Every participant verbally reported that they could feel a soft tap on the finger in response to the laser stimulus, but not to the sham stimulus. The spectrogram of EEG evoked by laser stimulation was similar to that evoked by mechanical stimulation; alpha ERD and beta ERS were present over the sensorimotor area in response to laser as well as mechanical stimuli. A decoding analysis revealed that classification error increased when discriminating ERD/S patterns between laser and mechanical stimuli, compared to the case of discriminating between laser and sham, or mechanical and sham stimuli. Our neurophysiological results confirm that tactile sensation can be evoked by the plasma effect induced by laser in the air, which may provide a mid-air haptic stimulation method.

The diagnosis of AD and its progression is performed through a variety of clinical procedures including neuropsychological and physical examination, Electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, brain imaging and blood analysis. During the last decades, analysis of the electrophysiological dynamics in AD patients has gained great research interest, as an alternative and cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes recent publications focusing on (a) AD detection and (b) the correlation of quantitative EEG features with AD progression, as it is estimated by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. A total of 49 experimental studies published from 2009 until 2020, which apply machine learning algorithms on resting state EEG recordings from AD patients, are reviewed. Results of each experimental study are presented and compared. The majority of the studies focus on AD detection incorporating Support Vector Machines, while deep learning techniques have not yet been applied on large EEG datasets. Promising conclusions for future studies are presented.

Classification of the four-class motor imagery signals using continuous wavelet transform filter bank-based two-dimensional images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						brain computer interface; common spatial pattern; continuous wavelet transform; convolutional neural network; electroencephalogram signals; motor imagery		The feature extraction technique plays a vital role in obtaining better classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed, which develops two-dimensional (2D) images for convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify four (left hand, right hand, feet, and tongue) MI tasks. 2D image is formed by decomposing each trial using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) filter bank after pre-processing the MI-based EEG data by multi-class common spatial pattern (CSP) method. Obtained images are used to train the CNN model for classification. The proposed framework is evaluated using publicly available BCI competition IV dataset 2a by calculating the classification accuracy for all subjects. Results show that the proposed framework has been giving better classification accuracy than some existing CNN-based and conventional machine learning-based approaches compared in this paper. The average time required to train CNN using the proposed framework is 12.67 s, acceptable for online MI-based BCI applications.

J	Barbosa, J; Lozano-Soldevilla, D; Compte, A				Barbosa, Joao; Lozano-Soldevilla, Diego; Compte, Albert			Pinging the brain with visual impulses reveals electrically active, not activity-silent, working memories	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; EEG	Persistently active neurons during mnemonic periods have been regarded as the mechanism underlying working memory maintenance. Alternatively, neuronal networks could instead store memories in fast synaptic changes, thus avoiding the biological cost of maintaining an active code through persistent neuronal firing. Such "activity-silent" codes have been proposed for specific conditions in which memories are maintained in a nonprioritized state, as for unattended but still relevant short-term memories. A hallmark of this "activity-silent" code is that these memories can be reactivated from silent, synaptic traces. Evidence for "activity-silent" working memory storage has come from human electroencephalography (EEG), in particular from the emergence of decodability (EEG reactivations) induced by visual impulses (termed pinging) during otherwise "silent" periods. Here, we reanalyze EEG data from such pinging studies. We find that the originally reported absence of memory decoding reflects weak statistical power, as decoding is possible based on more powered analyses or reanalysis using alpha power instead of raw voltage. This reveals that visual pinging EEG "reactivations" occur in the presence of an electrically active, not silent, code for unattended memories in these data. This crucial change in the evidence provided by this dataset prompts a reinterpretation of the mechanisms of EEG reactivations. We provide 2 possible explanations backed by computational models, and we discuss the relationship with TMS-induced EEG reactivations.

Most doctors and researchers utilized Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to measure and record brain activities. The recorded EEG signals have non-linear and nonstationary attributes with very low amplitude. Consequently, it is very difficult and time-consuming for humans to interpret such signals. Therefore, with the significance of computerized approaches, the identification of normal and alcohol EEG signals has become very useful in the medical field. In the present work, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is recommended for characterization of normal vs alcoholic EEG signals with following tasks. First, dataset is segmented into several EEG signals. Second, the autocorrelation of each signal is computed to enhance the strength of EEG signals. Third, coefficients of autocorrelation with several lags are considered as features and verified statistically. At last, significant features are tested on twenty machine learning classifiers available in the WEKA platform by employing a 10-fold cross-validation strategy for the classification of normal vs alcoholic signals. The obtained results are effective and support the usefulness of autocorrelation coefficients as features.

These signals are frequently used to obtain information about brain neurons and may detect disorders that affect the brain, such as epilepsy. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are however prone to artefacts. These artefacts must be removed to obtain accurate and meaningful signals. Currently, computer-aided systems have been used for this purpose. These systems provide high computing power, problem-specific development, and other advantages. In this study, a new clinical decision support system was developed for individuals to detect epileptic seizures using EEG signals. Comprehensive classification results were obtained for the extracted filtered features from the time-frequency domain. The classification accuracies of the time-frequency features obtained from discrete continuous transform (DCT), fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), and Hilbert transform (HT) are compared. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were applied, and back propagation (BP) was used as a learning method. Many studies in the literature describe a single BP algorithm. In contrast, we looked at several BP algorithms including gradient descent with momentum (GDM), scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), and gradient descent with adaptive learning rate (GDA). The most successful algorithm was tested using simulations made on three separate datasets (DCT_EEG, FrFT_EEG, and HT_EEG) that make up the input data. The HT algorithm was the most successful EEG feature extractor in terms of classification accuracy rates in each EEG dataset and had the highest referred accuracy rates of the algorithms. As a result, HT_EEG gives the highest accuracy for all algorithms, and the highest accuracy of 87.38% was produced by the SCG algorithm.

The medical decision support system DSS, for instance, helps health professionals obtain accurate and reliable readings and diagnosis of patients' vital signs. Nowadays, several medical devices allow capturing brain signals, some of these devices are wearable, which enhances signal quality and facilitates access to the signals than the traditional EEG devices. EEG signals are critical for assessing mental health and analyzing brain characteristics as they are able to detect a wide range of nerve-related diseases, such as stroke. This research seeks to study the use of machine learning techniques for the medical diagnosis of stroke through EEG signals obtained from the wearable device 'MUSE 2.' Eight ML techniques were used for analysis, the XGboost classifiers outperformed other classifiers in identifying strokes with an accuracy rate of 83.89%.

Trial by trial EEG based BCI for distress versus non distress classification in individuals with ASD	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is often accompanied by impaired emotion regulation (ER). There has been increasing emphasis on developing evidence-based approaches to improve ER in ASD. Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown success in reducing ASD symptoms when used in neurofeedback-based interventions. Also, certain EEG components are associated with ER. Our overarching goal is to develop a technology that will use EEG to monitor real-time changes in ER and perform intervention based on these changes. As a first step, an EEG-based brain computer interface that is based on an Affective Posner task was developed to identify patterns associated with ER on a single trial basis, and EEG data collected from 21 individuals with ASD. Accordingly, our aim in this study is to investigate EEG features that could differentiate between distress and non-distress conditions. Specifically, we investigate if the EEG time-locked to the visual feedback presentation could be used to classify between WIN (non-distress) and LOSE (distress) conditions in a game with deception. Results showed that the extracted EEG features could differentiate between WIN and LOSE conditions (average accuracy of 81%), LOSE and rest-EEG conditions (average accuracy 94.8%), and WIN and rest-EEG conditions (average accuracy 94.9%).

In most of the previous studies, the user's emotions were classified based on a stimulus. In this paper, we present a model that can classify the emotion intensity by the participants' self-report. Two machine learning classifiers are considered: support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Results demonstrated that both SVM and CNN models perform well with four classes of emotions (positive/negative valence high/low arousal combination) where SVM achieved an accuracy of 85% whereas CNN achieved 81%. Considering 12 classes of emotional responses (low, medium, and high intensity for positive/negative valence high/low arousal combination) by the participants' self report resulted in an accuracy of 70% for SVM and 69% for CNN. The proposed model excels in classifying emotional intensity and provides superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art emotion classification systems.

Among them, the acquisition of EEG signals has the advantages of non-invasive way with low cost. It has been widely used in brain-machine interface technology in recent years. Important progress has been made in rehabilitation and environmental control. However, neural feedback and brain-machine interface technology are completely similar in signal acquisition, signal feature extraction, and pattern classification. Therefore, the related research results of brain-machine interface can be used to closely cooperate with clinical needs to research and develop neural feedback technology based on EEG. Based on neurophysiology and brain-machine interface technology, this paper develops a neural feedback training system based on the acquisition and analysis of human EEG signals. Aiming at the autonomous rhythm components in the EEG signal, such as sensorirnotor rhythm and alpha rhythm, the characteristic parameters are extracted through real-time EEG signal processing to generate feedback informatim, and the subject is self-regulated and trained from a physiological-psychological perspective by providing adjuvant treatment, a practical and stable treatment platform for the clinic.

Synthetic Biological Signals Machine-Generated by GPT-2 Improve the Classification of EEG and EMG Through Data Augmentation	IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS			English	Article						Biological signal processing; data augmentation; electroencephalography; electromyography; synthetic data		Synthetic data augmentation is of paramount importance for machine learning classification, particularly for biological data, which tend to be high dimensional and with a scarcity of training samples. The applications of robotic control and augmentation in disabled and able-bodied subjects still rely mainly on subject-specific analyses. Those can rarely be generalised to the whole population and appear to over complicate simple action recognition such as grasp and release (standard actions in robotic prosthetics and manipulators). We show for the first time that multiple GPT-2 models can machine-generate synthetic biological signals (EMG and EEG) and improve real data classification. Models trained solely on GPT-2 generated EEG data can classify a real EEG dataset at 74.71% accuracy and models trained on GPT-2 EMG data can classify real EMG data at 78.24% accuracy. Synthetic and calibration data are then introduced within each cross validation fold when benchmarking EEG and EMG models. Results show algorithms are improved when either or both additional data are used. A Random Forest achieves a mean 95.81% (1.46) classification accuracy of EEG data, which increases to 96.69% (1.12) when synthetic GPT-2 EEG signals are introduced during training. Similarly, the Random Forest classifying EMG data increases from 93.62% (0.8) to 93.9% (0.59) when training data is augmented by synthetic EMG signals. Additionally, as predicted, augmentation with synthetic biological signals also increases the classification accuracy of data from new subjects that were not observed during training. A Robotiq 2F-85 Gripper was finally used for real-time gesture-based control, with synthetic EMG data augmentation remarkably improving gesture recognition accuracy, from 68.29% to 89.5%.

J	Chen, ZY; Wang, YJ; Song, ZY				Chen, Zhongye; Wang, Yijun; Song, Zhongyan			Classification of Motor Imagery Electroencephalography Signals Based on Image Processing Method	SENSORS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; motor imagery (MI); convolutional neural network (CNN); feature enhancement; attention module	COMMUNICATION; INTERFACES	In recent years, more and more frameworks have been applied to brain-computer interface technology, and electroencephalogram-based motor imagery (MI-EEG) is developing rapidly. However, it is still a challenge to improve the accuracy of MI-EEG classification. A deep learning framework termed IS-CBAM-convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to address the non-stationary nature, the temporal localization of excitation occurrence, and the frequency band distribution characteristics of the MI-EEG signal in this paper. First, according to the logically symmetrical relationship between the C3 and C4 channels, the result of the time-frequency image subtraction (IS) for the MI-EEG signal is used as the input of the classifier. It both reduces the redundancy and increases the feature differences of the input data. Second, the attention module is added to the classifier. A convolutional neural network is built as the base classifier, and information on the temporal location and frequency distribution of MI-EEG signal occurrences are adaptively extracted by introducing the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). This approach reduces irrelevant noise interference while increasing the robustness of the pattern. The performance of the framework was evaluated on BCI competition IV dataset 2b, where the mean accuracy reached 79.6%, and the average kappa value reached 0.592. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the framework and show the performance improvement of MI-EEG signal classification.

Electroencephalography (EEG) microstates (MSs), which reflect a large topographical representation of coherent electrophysiological brain activity, are widely adopted to study cognitive processes mechanisms and aberrant alterations in brain disorders. MS topographies are quasi-stable lasting between 60-120 ms. Some evidence suggests that MS are the electrophysiological signature of resting-state networks (RSNs). However, the spatial and functional interpretation of MS and their association with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains unclear. Approach. In a cohort of healthy subjects (n = 52), we conducted several statistical and machine learning (ML) approaches analyses on the association among MS spatio-temporal dynamics and the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) simultaneous EEG-fMRI data using statistical and ML approaches. Main results. Our results using a generalized linear model showed that MS transitions were largely and negatively associated with BOLD signals in the somatomotor, visual, dorsal attention, and ventral attention fMRI networks with limited association within the default mode network. Additionally, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) confirmed the association between MS transitioning and fMRI signal while revealing that MS dynamics can model BOLD signals and vice versa. Significance. Results suggest that MS transitions may represent the deactivation of fMRI RSNs and provide evidence that both modalities measure common aspects of undergoing brain neuronal activities. These results may help to better understand the electrophysiological interpretation of MS.

To avoid negative consequences on health and safety, it is very important to detect mental stress at its early stages, i.e., when it is still limited to acute or episodic stress. In this study, we developed an experimental protocol to induce two different levels of stress by utilizing a mental arithmetic task with time pressure and negative feedback as the stressors. We assessed the levels of stress on 22 healthy subjects using frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, salivary alpha-amylase level (AAL), and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers. The EEG signals were analyzed using a fusion of functional connectivity networks estimated by the Phase Locking Value (PLV) and temporal and spectral domain features. A total of 210 different features were extracted from all domains. Only the optimum multi-domain features were used for classification. We then quantified stress levels using statistical analysis and seven ML classifiers. Our result showed that the AAL level was significantly increased (p < 0.01) under stress condition in all subjects. Likewise, the functional connectivity network demonstrated a significant decrease under stress, p < 0.05. Moreover, we achieved the highest stress classification accuracy of 93.2% using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Other classifiers produced relatively similar results.

Two approaches are employed in KFCS to extract EEG features and to improve classification performance: the K-Order Propagation Number Algorithm is the former, calculating the node importance from the perspective of brain networks as a novel approach; the latter uses a set of feature extraction algorithms to adjust the thresholds. Working with the data collected from seven subjects, the highest classification accuracy of a single trial can reach over 90%, with an overall accuracy of 83%. Furthermore, this paper attempts to investigate the mechanisms of brain activeness under two scenarios by using a topography technique at the sensor-data level. The results suggest that the active regions at two states is different, which leaves further exploration for future investigations.

However, due to the constraint of electrode distribution behind the ear, the amplitude of SSVEP in ear-EEG signals is relatively low, which hinders the application of ear-EEG in SSVEP-based BCI. This study was aimed to improve the performance of ear-EEG in SSVEP-based BCI through re-implementing a compact convolutional neural network (EEGNet) with ensemble learning. We first evaluated the feasibility of applying widely used EEGNet models with different kernel numbers to decode SSVEP in ear-EEG signals. Then we applied an ensemble learning strategy to combine EEGNet models with different kernel numbers to improve the classification of ear-EEG signals. The ear-EEG data was from an open dataset, which acquired three sessions of SSVEP data induced by three flicker stimuli from eleven subjects. The average accuracy of EEGNet with ensemble learning for ear-EEG signals in cross-session validations at 1 s window length was 81.12% (from session 1 to session 2) and 81.74% (from session 1 to session 3), which significantly outperformed canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In addition, the network visualization indicated that EEGNet extracted features related to stimulation frequencies. The results showed promise for accurate classification of SSVEP in ear-EEG signals using deep learning models with strategies, helping to promote the SSVEP based BCI from laboratory to practical application.

J	Wang, HT; Xu, LF; Bezerianos, A; Chen, CQ; Zhang, ZG				Wang, Hongtao; Xu, Linfeng; Bezerianos, Anastasios; Chen, Chuangquan; Zhang, Zhiguo			Linking Attention-Based Multiscale CNN With Dynamical GCN for Driving Fatigue Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Attention-based multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN); driving fatigue; dynamical graph convolution network (GCN); electroencephalography (EEG); spatiotemporal structure	MENTAL FATIGUE; EEG; NETWORKS	Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been proven to be one of the most predictive and reliable indicators for estimating driving fatigue state. However, how to make full use of EEG data for driving fatigue detection remains a challenge. Many existing methods include a time-consuming manual process or tedious parameter tunings for feature extraction, which is inconvenient to train and implement. On the other hand, most models ignore or manually determine EEG connectivity features between different channels, thus failing to thoroughly exploit the intrinsic interchannel relations for classification. In this article, we introduce a new attention-based multiscale convolutional neural network-dynamical graph convolutional network (AMCNN-DGCN) model, aiming to conquer these two issues in a unified end-to-end model. AMCNN-DGCN starts with attention-based multiscale temporal convolutions to automatically learn frequency filters to extract the salient pattern from raw EEG data. Subsequently, AMCNN-DGCN uses dynamical graph convolutional networks (DGCNs) to learn spatial filters, in which the adjacency matrix is adaptively determined in a data-driven way to exploit the intrinsic relationship between channels effectively. With the temporal-spatial structure, AMCNN-DCCN can capture highly discriminative features. To verify the effectiveness of AMCNN-DGCN, we conduct a simulated fatigue driving environment to collect EEG signals from 29 healthy subjects (male/female = 17/12 and age = 23.28 +/- 2.70 years) through a remote wireless cap with 24 channels. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms six widely used competitive EEG models with high accuracy of 95.65%. Finally, the critical brain regions and connections for driving fatigue detection were investigated through the dynamically learned adjacency matrix.

Alternatively, it is common to describe and analyze the system dynamics through observations, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) signals are observed and used for representing the brain system. Even though, the underlying dynamics of the system is still not easily uncovered and displayed as a whole. In this study, we propose a data-driven approach based on the Koopman operator to reconstruct and analyze the underlying dynamics of dynamical systems by representing them in a linear intrinsic space. To demonstrate the applicability, we apply the proposed method to dynamical pattern recognition problems, and validate it with a simulation study of the Lorenz system and a brain disorder of epileptic seizure using multi-variate EEG signals. Furthermore, we introduce a new measurement that is derived from the reconstructed dynamics associated with the attractor of the system in the Koopman intrinsic space. The experimental results conclude the effectiveness of the proposed method for anomaly detection using the reconstructed dynamical information.

Evidence has shown that subjects with depression exhibit different spatial responses in neurophysiological signals from the healthy controls when they are exposed to positive and negative stimuli. Methods: We proposed an effective electroencephalogram-based detection method for depression classification using spatial information. A face-in-the-crowd task, including positive and negative emotional facial expressions, was presented to 30 participants, including 16 depression patients and 14 healthy controls. Differential entropy and the genetic algorithm were used for feature extraction and selection, and a support vector machine was used for classification. A task-related common spatial pattern (TCSP) was proposed to enhance the spatial differences before the feature extraction. Results and discussion: We achieved a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation classification result of 84% and 85.7% for positive and negative stimuli, respectively, using TCSP, which is statistically significantly higher than 81.7% and 83.2%, respectively, acquired without the TCSP (p < 0.05). We also evaluated the classification performance using individual frequency bands and found that the contribution of the gamma band was predominant. In addition, we evaluated different classifiers, including k-nearest neighbor and logistic regression, which showed similar trends in the improvement of classification by employing TCSP. Conclusion: The results show that our proposed method, employing spatial information, significantly improves the accuracy of classifying depression patients.

Manual seizure identification on EEG by trained neurologists is time-consuming, labor-intensive and a reliable automatic seizure/non-seizure classification method is needed. One of the challenges in automatic seizure/non-seizure classification is that seizure morphologies exhibit considerable variabilities. In order to capture essential seizure patterns, this paper leverages an attention mechanism and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to exploit both spatial and temporal discriminating features and overcome seizure variabilities. The attention mechanism captures spatial features according to the contributions of different brain regions to seizures. BiLSTM extracts discriminating temporal features in forward and backward directions. Cross-validation experiments and cross-patient experiments over the noisy data of CHB-MIT were performed. We obtained average sensitivity of 87.30%, specificity of 88.30% and precision of 88.29% in cross-validation experiments, higher than using the current state-of-the-art methods, and the standard deviations were lower. These results indicate that our approach performs well against current state-of-the-art methods and is more robust across patients.

However, these EEG data are difficult to analyze, because of their anomalous characteristic where statistical elements vary according to time as well as spatial-temporal correlations. Therefore, new methods that can clearly distinguish emotional states in EEG data are required. In this paper, we propose a new emotion recognition method, named AsEmo. The proposed method extracts effective features boosting classification performance on various emotional states from multi-class EEG data. AsEmo Automatically determines the number of spatial filters needed to extract significant features using the explained variance ratio (EVR) and employs a Subject-independent method for real-time processing of Emotion EEG data. The advantages of this method are as follows: (a) it automatically determines the spatial filter coefficients distinguishing emotional states and extracts the best features; (b) it is very robust for real-time analysis of new data using a subject-independent technique that considers subject sets, and not a specific subject; (c) it can be easily applied to both binary-class and multi-class data. Experimental results on real-world EEG emotion recognition tasks demonstrate that AsEmo outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with a 2-8% improvement in terms of classification accuracy.

In emotion recognition, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easier to be recorded than other physiological experiments and are not easily camouflaged. Because of the high dimensional nature of EEG data and the diversity of human emotions, it is difficult to extract effective EEG features and recognize the emotion patterns. This paper proposes a multi-feature deep forest (MFDF) model to identify human emotions. The EEG signals are firstly divided into several EEG frequency bands and then extract the power spectral density (PSD) and differential entropy (DE) from each frequency band and the original signal as features. A five-class emotion model is used to mark five emotions, including neutral, angry, sad, happy, and pleasant. With either original features or dimension reduced features as input, the deep forest is constructed to classify the five emotions. These experiments are conducted on a public dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP). The experimental results are compared with traditional classifiers, including K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The MFDF achieves the average recognition accuracy of 71.05%, which is 3.40%, 8.54%, and 19.53% higher than RF, KNN, and SVM, respectively. Besides, the accuracies with the input of features after dimension reduction and raw EEG signal are only 51.30 and 26.71%, respectively. The result of this study shows that the method can effectively contribute to EEG-based emotion classification tasks.

Common Spatial Pattern Technique With EEG Signals for Diagnosis of Autism and Epilepsy Disorders	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Epilepsy; Band-pass filters; Autism; Support vector machines; Entropy; Artificial neural network; autism spectrum disorder; band power; brain--computer interface; common spatial pattern; electroencephalogram; energy; entropy; epilepsy; k-nearest neighbor; linear discriminant analysis; support vector machine	SPECTRUM DISORDER; CLASSIFICATION; METHODOLOGY; FRACTALITY	Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals reflect the activities or electrical disturbances in neurons in the human brain. Therefore, these signals are vital for diagnosing certain brain disorders. This study mainly focused on the diagnosis of epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) through the analysis and processing of EEGs. In this study, artifacts were removed from the EEG datasets using Independent Component Analysis and were filtered using a fifth-order band-pass Butterworth filter to remove interference and noise. Next, new methods were used to extract the features of EEGs using common spatial pattern (CSP). It is known that conventional CSP uses variance. However, here the use of entropy, energy, and band power with CSP was proposed to extract features of EEGs. Then, in our investigation, four techniques were employed for classification, namely, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and artificial neural network, with the aim of comparing the proposed methods and recommending the optimal combination for the diagnosis of epilepsy and ASDs. Finally, the effects of segment length, frequency band, and reduction number on the results were investigated. Two EEG datasets were employed to verify the proposed methods: the King Abdulaziz University dataset (for ASD) and the MIT dataset (for epilepsy). The results indicated that the extracted features based on CSP and band LBP produced the best performance and that the combination of CSP-LBP-KNN provided the best performance with average classification accuracy of approximately 98.46% and 98.62% for diagnosing ASDs and epilepsy, respectively.

It has been studied not only in education but also in medicine, particularly regarding the diagnosis of disorders such as mild cognitive impairment. In our study, we examined the generalisability of cognitive load metrics obtained with electroencephalography (EEG) across various participants and contexts in four combinations: (a) inter-subject and intra-context, (b) inter-subject and inter-context, (c) intra-subject and intra-context, and (d) intra-subject and inter-context. Methods: EEG signals were recorded from 19 participants as they completed two cognitive assessment tests with differentiable levels of cognitive load: the n-back test and Stroop test. The data obtained were processed to extract numerous features that were later reduced following a forward feature selection and used to train different models for the various combinations of generalisability. Results: Analysing the performance of trained models revealed that classification in (a) showed results close to random classification, in (b) showed significative differences between Stroop levels, in (c) revealed a classifier able to find patterns associated with the various levels of cognitive load for both tests, and in (d) indicated that Stroop levels were differentiable . Conclusions: Although the methods analysed can be used to determine patterns for each participant in a particular context and applied to different contexts, they cannot establish generalisable models among participants in a single context. Our analysis of the feature selection captured a group of powerful algorithms and parameters potentially usable for extracting features in cognitive load analysis.

Spectral features of cortical auditory evoked potentials inform hearing threshold and intensity percepts in acoustic and electric hearing	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; classification; cortical auditory responses; frequency domain; event-related spectral perturbation; inter-trial coherence	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CAEPS	Objective. Stimulus-elicited changes in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings can be represented using Fourier magnitude and phase features (Makeig et al (2004 Trends Cogn. Sci. 8 204-10)). The present study aimed to quantify how much information about hearing responses are contained in the magnitude, quantified by event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs); and the phase, quantified by inter-trial coherence (ITC). By testing if one feature contained more information and whether this information was mutually exclusive to the features, we aimed to relate specific EEG magnitude and phase features to hearing perception. Approach. EEG responses were recorded from 20 adults who were presented with acoustic stimuli, and 20 adult cochlear implant users with electrical stimuli. Both groups were presented with short, 50 ms stimuli at varying intensity levels relative to their hearing thresholds. Extracted ERSP and ITC features were inputs for a linear discriminant analysis classifier (Wong et al (2016 J. Neural. Eng. 13 036003)). The classifier then predicted whether the EEG signal contained information about the sound stimuli based on the input features. Classifier decoding accuracy was quantified with the mutual information measure (Cottaris and Elfar (2009 J. Neural. Eng. 6 026007), Hawellek et al (2016 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. 113 13492-7)), and compared across the two feature sets, and to when both feature sets were combined. Main results. We found that classifiers using either ITC or ERSP feature sets were both able to decode hearing perception, but ITC-feature classifiers were able to decode responses to a lower but still audible stimulation intensity, making ITC more useful than ERSP for hearing threshold estimation. We also found that combining the information from both feature sets did not improve decoding significantly, implying that ERSP brain dynamics has a limited contribution to the EEG response, possibly due to the stimuli used in this study. Significance. We successfully related hearing perception to an EEG measure, which does not require behavioral feedback from the listener; an objective measure is important in both neuroscience research and clinical audiology.

J	Chen, Y; Chang, R; Guo, JF				Chen, Yu; Chang, Rui; Guo, Jifeng			Effects of Data Augmentation Method Borderline-SMOTE on Emotion Recognition of EEG Signals Based on Convolutional Neural Network	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Emotion recognition; Electroencephalography; Licenses; Physiology; Brain modeling; Classification algorithms; Electroencephalogram; emotion recognition; Borderline-Synthetic minority oversampling technique; convolutional neural network	LSTM	In recent years, with the continuous development of artificial intelligence and brain-computer interface technology, emotion recognition based on physiological signals, especially electroencephalogram signals, has become a popular research topic and attracted wide attention. However, the imbalance of the data sets themselves, affective features' extraction from electroencephalogram signals, and the design of classifiers with excellent performance, pose a great challenge to the subject. Motivated by the outstanding performance of deep learning approaches in pattern recognition tasks, we propose a method based on convolutional neural network with data augmentation method Borderline-synthetic minority oversampling technique. First, we obtain 32-channel electroencephalogram signals from DEAP data set, which is the standard data set of emotion recognition. Then, after data pre-processing, we extract features in frequency domain and data augmentation based on the data augmentation algorithm above for getting more balanced data. Finally, we train a one dimensional convolutional neural network for three classification on two emotional dimensions valence and arousal. Meanwhile, the proposed method is compared with some traditional machine learning methods and some existing methods by other researchers, which is proved to be effective in emotion recognition, and the average accuracy rate of 32 subjects on valence and arousal are 97.47% and 97.76% respectively. Compared with other existing methods, the performance of the proposed method with data augmentation algorithm Borderline-SMOTE shows its advantage in affective emotional recognition than that without Borderline-SMOTE.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) decode information from neural activity and send it to external devices. The use of Deep Learning approaches for decoding allows for automatic feature engineering within the specific decoding task. Physiologically plausible interpretation of the network parameters ensures the robustness of the learned decision rules and opens the exciting opportunity for automatic knowledge discovery. Approach. We describe a compact convolutional network-based architecture for adaptive decoding of electrocorticographic (ECoG) data into finger kinematics. We also propose a novel theoretically justified approach to interpreting the spatial and temporal weights in the architectures that combine adaptation in both space and time. The obtained spatial and frequency patterns characterizing the neuronal populations pivotal to the specific decoding task can then be interpreted by fitting appropriate spatial and dynamical models. Main results. We first tested our solution using realistic Monte-Carlo simulations. Then, when applied to the ECoG data from Berlin BCI competition IV dataset, our architecture performed comparably to the competition winners without requiring explicit feature engineering. Using the proposed approach to the network weights interpretation we could unravel the spatial and the spectral patterns of the neuronal processes underlying the successful decoding of finger kinematics from an ECoG dataset. Finally we have also applied the entire pipeline to the analysis of a 32-channel EEG motor-imagery dataset and observed physiologically plausible patterns specific to the task. Significance. We described a compact and interpretable CNN architecture derived from the basic principles and encompassing the knowledge in the field of neural electrophysiology. For the first time in the context of such multibranch architectures with factorized spatial and temporal processing we presented theoretically justified weights interpretation rules. We verified our recipes using simulations and real data and demonstrated that the proposed solution offers a good decoder and a tool for investigating motor control neural mechanisms.

Methods: 98 days of continuous frontotemporal EEG from 11 consecutive patients was evaluated daily by an epileptologist to recommend reduction or maintenance of the sedative level. We evaluated the need to increase sedation in the 6 h following this recommendation. Post-hoc analysis of the quantitative EEG was correlated with the level of sedation using a machine learning algorithm. Results: Eleven patients were studied for a total of ninety-eight sedation days. EEG was consistent with excessive sedation on 57 (58%) and adequate sedation on 41 days (42%). Recommendations were followed by the team on 59% (N = 58; 19 to reduce and 39 to keep the sedation level). In the 6 h following reduction in sedation, increases of sedation were needed in 7 (12%). Automatized classification of EEG sedation levels reached 80% (+/- 17%) accuracy. Conclusions: Visual inspection of a limited EEG helped sedation depth guidance. In a secondary analysis, our data supported that this determination may be automated using quantitative EEG analysis. Significance: Our results support the use of frontotemporal EEG for guiding sedation in patients with COVID-19. (C) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Shen, F; Liu, J; Wu, K				Shen, Fang; Liu, Jing; Wu, Kai			Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Based on Elastic Net and High-Order Fuzzy Cognitive Maps: A Case Study on Human Action Prediction Through EEG Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Time series analysis; Electroencephalography; Forecasting; Prediction algorithms; Brain modeling; Predictive models; Proposals; 1D-convolutional neural network (1D-CNN); elastic net; electroencephalogram (EEG); fuzzy cognitive map (FCM); time series prediction	MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORK; DESIGN; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; EXTRACTION; SELECTION; AUC	Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have been successfully applied to time series forecasting. However, it still remains challenging to handle multivariate long nonstationary time series, such as EEG data, which may change rapidly and have patterns of trend. To overcome this limitation, in this article, we propose a fast prediction model to deal with multivariate long nonstationary time series based on the combination of elastic net and high order fuzzy cognitive map (HFCM), which is termed as ElasticNet(HFCM). The designed FCM models each variable by one node and the high-order FCM helps to capture the patterns of trend. A case study on predicting human actions through the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data in the form of multichannel long nonstationary time series is investigated based on the proposed prediction model. Specifically, we first predict EEG signals based on the historical data, then a 1D-convolutionary neural network (1D-CNN) is developed to classify the predicted time series. The experimental results on the Grasp-and-Lift dataset show that the proposal can predict the EEG data with lower prediction error compared with the other regression methods. The area under the curve scores obtained on the Grasp-and-Lift dataset by 1D-CNN are higher than those obtained by state-of-the-art classification methods for EEG data in most cases. These results illustrate that the proposal can predict and classify multivariate long nonstationary time series with high accuracy and efficiency.

Electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were concurrently recorded from 28 healthy subjects while performing various ankle joint movements. The two types of biosignals were fused at feature level, and five different classifiers were used for the purpose of movement recognition. The performance of the classifiers with multimodal and single modality data were assessed with five different sampling window sizes. The results demonstrated that the use of a multimodal approach results in an improvement of the classification accuracy with a linear discriminator analysis classifier (LDA). The highest recognition accuracy was 96.64 +/- 4.48% with a window size of 250 sample points, in contrast with 89.99 +/- 7.94% for EEG data alone. Furthermore, the multimodal fusion based on DCA was validated with fatigued EMG signal to investigate the robustness of the fusion technique against the muscular fatigue. In addition, the statistical analysis result demonstrates that the proposed fusion approach provides a substantial improvement in motion recognition accuracy 96.64 +/- 4.48% (p < 0.0001) compared to method based on a single modality.

It provides a high temporal but low spatial resolution of brain activity. To gain insight about the spatial dynamics of the EEG, one has to solve the inverse problem, i.e., finding the neural sources that give rise to the recorded EEG activity. The inverse problem is ill-posed, which means that more than one configuration of neural sources can evoke one and the same distribution of EEG activity on the scalp. Artificial neural networks have been previously used successfully to find either one or two dipole sources. These approaches, however, have never solved the inverse problem in a distributed dipole model with more than two dipole sources. We present ConvDip, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, that solves the EEG inverse problem in a distributed dipole model based on simulated EEG data. We show that (1) ConvDip learned to produce inverse solutions from a single time point of EEG data and (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all focused performance measures. (3) It is more flexible when dealing with varying number of sources, produces less ghost sources and misses less real sources than the comparison methods. It produces plausible inverse solutions for real EEG recordings from human participants. (4) The trained network needs <40 ms for a single prediction. Our results qualify ConvDip as an efficient and easy-to-apply novel method for source localization in EEG data, with high relevance for clinical applications, e.g., in epileptology and real-time applications.

These devices apply electrical stimuli to prevent seizures from propagating in the brain, but excessive stimulation caused by a high false positive rate (FPR) can cause side effects and require more frequent battery replacement surgeries. Reducing the FPR requires vast and balanced training sets, but seizures only comprise <1% of clinically recorded EEG data. In this work, we present a method of generating multi-channel seizure data with a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network. This approach is demonstrated to reduce the false positive rate by 72.72%, significantly reducing the frequency of erroneously applied electrical stimuli that could degrade patients' quality of life. This is achieved without changing the algorithm implemented on neurostimulators and only slightly increasing detection latency while maintaining 100% seizure sensitivity.

Artificial intelligence encompasses a variety of areas, and one of its branches is deep learning (DL). Before the rise of DL, conventional machine learning algorithms involving feature extraction were performed. This limited their performance to the ability of those handcrafting the features. However, in DL, the extraction of features and classification are entirely automated. The advent of these techniques in many areas of medicine, such as in the diagnosis of epileptic seizures, has made significant advances. In this study, a comprehensive overview of works focused on automated epileptic seizure detection using DL techniques and neuroimaging modalities is presented. Various methods proposed to diagnose epileptic seizures automatically using EEG and MRI modalities are described. In addition, rehabilitation systems developed for epileptic seizures using DL have been analyzed, and a summary is provided. The rehabilitation tools include cloud computing techniques and hardware required for implementation of DL algorithms. The important challenges in accurate detection of automated epileptic seizures using DL with EEG and MRI modalities are discussed.

Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based Performance Analysis and Epilepsy Identification from EEG Signals	IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						EEG; Epilepsy; Extreme Learning Machine (ELM); Seizures	CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; SEIZURES	Epilepsy is a chronic brain condition affecting one in 100 patients. EEG (Electroencephalogram) is a signal representing the influence of combining various processes in the brain. This paper aims to identify the likelihood levels of epilepsy from the features extracted from the EEG signals and to compare them with the output of the Singular Value Decomposition and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The SVD approach extracts functionality from EEG signals (that is, to minimize dimensionality) while the ELM is used as a classification system. A study of twenty patients is documented in this paper. The criteria such as the Performance Index (PI), Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), Average Detection (AD), and Good Detection Ratio (GDR) are evaluated using ELM to identify epilepsy. Results show that when SVD is classified with ELM at sigmoid activation function, an average detection of 98.94% and a GDR of 97.83% are obtained.

In this study, we proposed a novel EEG feature, the kernel eigen-relative-power (KERP) feature, for achieving high classification accuracy of MCI versus HC. First, we introduced the relative powers (RPs) between pairs of electrodes across 21 different subbands of 2-Hz width as the features, which have not yet been used in previous MCI-HC classification studies. Next, the Fisher's class separability criterion was applied to determine the best electrode pairs (five electrodes) as well as the frequency subbands for extracting the most sensitive RP features. The kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) algorithm was further performed to extract a few more discriminating nonlinear principal components from the optimal RPs, and these components form a KERP feature vector. Results carried out on 51 participants (24 MCI and 27 HC) show that the newly introduced subband RP feature showed superior classification performance to commonly used spectral power features, including the band power, single-electrode relative power, and also the RP based on the conventional frequency bands. A high leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV) classification accuracy 86.27% was achieved by the RP feature, using a simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. Moreover, with the same classifier, the proposed KERP further improved the accuracy to 88.24%. Finally, cascading the KERP feature to a nonlinear classifier, the support vector machine (SVM), yields a high MCI-HC classification accuracy of 90.20% (sensitivity = 87.50% and specificity = 92.59%). The proposed method demonstrated a high accuracy and a high usability (only five electrodes are required), and therefore, has great potential to further develop an EEG-based computer-aided diagnosis system that can be applied for the early detection of MCI.

We present an application for elderly adult dementia onset prognostication. First, the paper explains our encouraging preliminary study results of EEG responses analysis using a signal complexity measure of multiscale entropy (MSE) in reminiscent interior working memory evaluation tasks. Then, we compare shallow and deep learning machine learning models for a digital biomarker of dementia onset detection. The evaluated machine-learning models succeed in the most reliable median accuracies above 80% using random forest and fully connected neural network classifiers in automatic discrimination of normal cognition versus a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) task. The classifier input features consist of MSE patterns only derived from four dry EEG electrodes. Fifteen elderly subjects voluntarily participate in the reported study focusing on EEG-based objective dementia biomarker advancement. The results showcase the essential social advantages of artificial intelligence (AI) application for the dementia prognosis and advance ML for the subsequent use for simple objective EEG-based examination.

However, the functional connectivity between brain regions based on MMN is not clear. This study provides an in-depth investigation in brain functional connectivity during MMN process among patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FESZ), chronic schizophrenia (CSZ) and healthy control (HC). Electroencephalography (EEG) data of 128 channels is recorded during frequency and duration MMN in 40 FESZ, 40 CSZ patients and 40 matched HC subjects. We reconstruct the cortical endogenous electrical activity from EEG recordings using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography and build functional brain networks based on source-level EEG data. Then, graph-theoretic features are extracted from the brain networks with the support vector machine (SVM) to classify FESZ, CSZ and HC groups, since the SVM has good generalization ability and robustness as a universally applicable nonlinear classifier. Furthermore, we introduce the graph neural network (GNN) model to directly learn for the network topology of brain network. Compared to HC, the damaged brain areas of CSZ are more extensive than FESZ, and the damaged area involved the auditory cortex. These results demonstrate the heterogeneity of the impacts of schizophrenia for different disease courses and the association between MMN and the auditory cortex. More importantly, the GNN classification results are significantly better than those of SVM, and hence the EEG-based GNN model of brain networks provides an effective method for discriminating among FESZ, CSZ and HC groups.

Emotion recognition from EEG signals has facilitated to impaired peoples to intact with real world. Multi-components EEG signal need to decomposed into set of components to extract the hidden information, empirical selection of decomposition parameters can lead to loss of information due to mode mixing, generation of noisy modes, poor signal synthesis, etc. In this paper, optimized variational mode decomposition is proposed for emotion recognition using single-channel EEG signals. The Eigenvector centrality method (EVCM) is employed for dominant channel selection. An optimum number of modes (K-opt) and penalty factor (alpha(opt)) are selected adaptively for decomposition of non- stationary EEG signals. Time-domain features are elicited from the modes of EEG signals. The posthoc analysis are employed for significant features selection, these features are used as input to different classifiers for emotion classification. The overall accuracy of 97.24% is achieved with an extreme learning machine classifier for a four emotion classification. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by five performance parameters. F-1 score, false-positive rate, Mathew's correlation coefficient, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.9454, 0.94%, 92.92%, and 0.9633 is obtained. In comparison with traditional variationalmode decomposition and existing state-of-the-art using the same dataset, the proposed method shows improved performance of about 4% and 2%.

The band power in the alpha and beta bands was extracted from the EEG segments and used as features to construct the SL dictionary, in which the GA was employed for channel selection. The GABSLEEG system was tested in three functional areas: i) classification of MI data and idle state data; ii) performance with decreased training data size; and iii) computational efficiency. The system was evaluated by dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The proposed GABSLEEG model is found to significantly outperform conventional classifiers, including the support vec-tor machine (SVM) classifier in (i-iii), and the random forest (RF) and the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifiers in (i-ii). The GABSLEEG system consistently had a higher classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The average accuracy of the proposed system was 99.65%, on BCI Competition IV dataset 1 and 96.08% for BCI Competition III dataset IVa with the idle state included as a class, which was on a par with state-of-the-art SL and even deep learning approaches.

Long-term EEG recordings of an epileptic patient contain a huge amount of EEG data. Therefore, detecting epileptic activity is a very demanding process that requires a detailed analysis of the entire length of the EEG data, usually performed by an expert. This paper evaluates machine learning classifiers' performance with their paradigms for classification of raw EEG signals into two classes, i.e., seizure and non-seizure. Here, the 13 descriptive features are taken into consideration and fed to the classifiers. Here, CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database is used, which comprises paediatric subjects of 24 records. The performance of classifiers is evaluated categorically concerning gender and in total. The results confirmed that the fine KNN is the best classifier in males, females, and all subjects.

However, few studies demonstrated the impact of massage on the Electroencephalograph (EEG) rhythm decoding of Motor imagery (MI) and motion execution (ME) with trunk left/right bending in patients with skeletal muscle pain. Method: We used the sample entropy (SampEn), permutation entropy (PermuEn), common spatial pattern (CSP) features, support vector machine (SVM) and logic regression (LR) classifiers. We also used the convolutional neural network (CNN) and attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) for classification. Results: The averaged SampEn and PermuEn values of alpha rhythm decreased in almost fourteen channels for five statuses (quiet, MI with left/right bending, ME with left/right bending). It indicated that massage alleviates the pain for the patients of skeletal pain. Furthermore, compared with the SVM and LR classifiers, the BiLSTM method achieved a better area under curve (AUC) of 0.89 for the classification of MI with trunk left/right bending before massage. The AUC became smaller after massage than that before massage for the classification of MI with trunk left/right bending using CNN and BiLSTM methods. The Permutation direct indicator (PDI) score showed the significant difference for patients in different statuses (before vs after massage, and MI vs ME). Conclusions: Massage not only affects the quiet status, but also affects the MI and ME. Clinical Impact: Massage therapy may affect a bit on the accuracy of MI with trunk left/right bending and it change the topography of MI and ME with trunk left/right bending for the patients with skeletal muscle pain.

A Comparison of Conventional and Tri-Polar EEG Electrodes for Decoding Real and Imaginary Finger Movements from One Hand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; electroencephalography; electrodes; Laplace equation; fingers	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES	The representations of different fingers in the sensorimotor cortex are largely overlapped, which necessitate a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high spatial resolution to classify individual finger movements from one hand. Electroencephalography (EEG) recorded with disc electrodes has low SNR and poor spatial resolution. The surface Laplacian has been applied to EEG to improve the spatial resolution and selectivity of the surface electrical activity recording. Tri-polar concentric ring electrodes (TCREs) were shown to estimate the Laplacian automatically with better spatial resolution than disc electrodes. For this work, movement-related potentials (MRPs) were recorded from four TCREs and disc electrodes while 13 subjects performed real and imaginary finger movements. The MRP signals recorded with the TCREs have significantly less mutual information and coherence between neighboring locations compared to disc electrodes. The results also show that signals from TCREs generated higher accuracy compared to disc electrodes. It further shows that TCREs using temporal EEG data as features yield an average accuracy of 70.0 +/- 7.7% and 63.3 +/- 5.8% for real and imaginary finger movements, respectively, which is significantly higher than utilizing EEG spectral power changes in alpha and beta bands as features. Similarly, with the disc electrodes, it achieved highest accuracy of 46.13 +/- 6.77% and 34.03 +/- 5.03% for real and imaginary finger movements, respectively, with temporal EEG data feature.

One of the main lines of research in the treatment of ADHD involved the employment of electroencephalography (EEG) Neurofeedback as a means of providing a quantification and representation of the concentration level. The current investigation constitutes a first step in developing an application of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems aiding in the treatment of ADHD employing a Brain Computer Interface, based on the measurements detected by an EEG sensor. These measurements modify the flight height of a quadrotor according to the signal evaluation. In order to develop the proposed system, a real-time mechanism for processing and classifying the electrophysiological artifacts has been developed. Finally, the processed signals are then fed into the aircraft controller, modifying the aircraft flight and thus providing the desired feedback to the user.

The underlying research does not give us a clear distinction between those 2 entities, although depression is among the most frequent comorbid diagnosis in borderline personality patients. The notion that depression can be a distinct disorder but also a symptom in other psychopathologies led our team to try and delineate those 2 entities using 146 EEG recordings and machine learning. The utilized algorithms, developed solely for this purpose, could not differentiate those 2 entities, meaning that patients suffering from MDD did not have significantly different EEG in terms of patients diagnosed with MDD and BPD respecting the given data and methods used. By increasing the data set and the spatiotemporal specificity, one could have a more sensitive diagnostic approach when using EEG recordings. To our knowledge, this is the first study that used EEG recordings and advanced machine learning techniques and further confirmed the close interrelationship between those 2 entities.

However, the electroencephalography (EEG) signals are distorted by movement artifacts and electromyography signals when users are moving, which make hard to recognize human intention. In addition, as hardware issues are also challenging, ear-EEG has been developed for practical brain-computer interface and has been widely used. In this paper, we proposed ensemble-based convolutional neural networks in ambulatory environment and analyzed the visual event-related potential responses in scalp- and ear-EEG in terms of statistical analysis and brain-computer interface performance. The brain-computer interface performance deteriorated as 3-14% when walking fast at 1.6 m/s. The proposed methods showed 0.728 in average of the area under the curve. The proposed method shows robust to the ambulatory environment and imbalanced data as well.

In this article, a novel framework combining 3-D feature representation and dilated fully convolutional network (3DFR-DFCN) is proposed for EEG emotion recognition (EER). To excavate the prior knowledge, such as interchannel and interfrequency-band correlation information, 1-D feature sequences are extended into 2-D electrode meshes of different frequency bands. Then, the acquired electrode meshes under multiple activation patterns are further constructed into 3-D EEG arrays to capture their complementary information. To realize cross-band and cross-channel feature learning, a dilated fully convolutional network (DFCN) is built to process the input feature array, then the spectral norm regularization (SNR) item is introduced to reduce the sensitivity to the disturbed EEG features. Both subject-dependent and subject-independent experiments have conducted on DEAP and DREAMER data sets. An average accuracy of 94.59%/81.03%, 95.32%/79.91%, 94.78%/80.23% are, respectively, obtained for valence, arousal, and dominance classifications for two kinds of experiments on the DEAP data set. The integration of spatial information and frequency-band information is meaningful for assessment of human emotional states in practical or clinical applications.

In recent years, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted attention for visual event-related potential (ERP)-based BCIs and motor-imagery BCIs as an effective technique that can adapt to the variations in patterns among subjects and trials. The applications of the SSL techniques are expected to improve the performance of auditory ERP-based BCIs as well. However, there is no conclusive evidence supporting the positive effect of SSL techniques on auditory ERP-based BCIs. If the positive effect could be verified, it will be helpful for the BCI community. In this study, we assessed the effects of SSL techniques on two public auditory BCI datasets-AMUSE and PASS2D-using the following machine learning algorithms: step-wise linear discriminant analysis, shrinkage linear discriminant analysis, spatial temporal discriminant analysis, and least-squares support vector machine. These backbone classifiers were firstly trained by labeled data and incrementally updated by unlabeled data in every trial of testing data based on SSL approach. Although a few data of the datasets were negatively affected, most data were apparently improved by SSL in all cases. The overall accuracy was logarithmically increased with every additional unlabeled data. This study supports the positive effect of SSL techniques and encourages future researchers to apply them to auditory ERP-based BCIs.

The EEG signal is priliminarily screened by a cascaded thresholding method built on the distributions of signal amplitude, amplitude displacement, as well as the cross channel correlation. Then, the channel correlation of the two frontal electrodes (FP1, FP2), the fractal dimension, and the mean of amplitude difference between FP1 and FP2, are extracted to characterize the filtered EEGs. The GMM trained on these features is applied for the eye blink detection. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied on two EEG datasets collected by the Temple University Hospital (TUH) and the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (CHZU), where the datasets are recorded from epilepsy and encephalitis patients, and contain a lot of eye blink artifacts. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the highest detection precision and F1 score over the state-of-the-art methods.

Often, sleep is analyzed using macrostructure sleep stages which alone cannot provide information about the functional structure and stability of sleep. The cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) is a physiological recurring electroencephalogram (EEG) activity occurring in the brain during sleep and captures microstructure of the sleep and can be used to identify sleep instability. The CAP can also be associated with various sleep-related pathologies, and can be useful in identifying various sleep disorders. Conventionally, sleep is analyzed using polysomnogram (PSG) in various sleep laboratories by trained physicians and medical practitioners. However, PSG-based manual sleep analysis by trained medical practitioners is onerous, tedious and unfavourable for patients. Hence, a computerized, simple and patient convenient system is highly desirable for monitoring and analysis of sleep. In this study, we have proposed a system for automated identification of CAP phase-A and phase-B. To accomplish the task, we have utilized the openly accessible CAP sleep database. The study is performed using two single-channel EEG modalities and their combination. The model is developed using EEG signals of healthy subjects as well as patients suffering from six different sleep disorders namely nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE), sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), narcolepsy, periodic leg movement disorder (PLM), insomnia and rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) subjects. An optimal orthogonal wavelet filter bank is used to perform the wavelet decomposition and subsequently, entropy and Hjorth parameters are extracted from the decomposed coefficients. The extracted features have been applied to different machine learning algorithms. The best performance is obtained using ensemble of bagged tress (EBagT) classifier. The proposed method has obtained the average classification accuracy of 84%, 83%, 81%, 78%, 77%, 76% and 72% for NFLE, healthy, SDB, narcolepsy, PLM, insomnia and RBD subjects, respectively in discriminating phases A and B using a balanced database. Our developed model yielded an average accuracy of 78% when all 77 subjects including healthy and sleep disordered patients are considered. Our proposed system can assist the sleep specialists in an automated and efficient analysis of sleep using sleep microstructure.

Existing non-invasive methods for automated cognitive performance detection need improvements in terms of accuracy. In this work, a novel approach for cognitive performance has been proposed which uses short-duration electroencephalography (EEG) signal (4.094 s). Stationary wavelet transform (SWT) has been used to decompose the signal followed by extraction of entropy-based features and classification using selected attributes. To tackle the imbalanced data issue, adaptive synthetic sampling approach has been used. The proposed technique works in two modes: multi-lead approach (MLA), where EEG signal from multiple leads was used, and a novel lead-specific approach (LSA), where EEG signal from a single lead (F4) was used. A high accuracy of 94.00% in MLA and 93.70% in LSA reflects reliability of the proposed technique. The use of short-duration single-lead EEG signal makes this technique suitable for continuous monitoring system of cognitive performance during mental workload.

However, even the state of the art performance of lower limb voluntary movement intention decoding still faces many obstacles. In the following work, focusing on the perspective of the inner mechanism, a homology characteristic of EEG and EMG for lower limb voluntary movement intention was conducted. A mathematical model of EEG and EMG was built based on its mechanism, which consists of a neural mass model (NMM), neuromuscular junction model, EMG generation model, decoding model, and musculoskeletal biomechanical model. The mechanism analysis and simulation results demonstrated that EEG and EMG signals were both excited by the same movement intention with a response time difference. To assess the efficiency of the proposed model, a synchronous acquisition system for EEG and EMG was constructed to analyze the homology and response time difference from EEG and EMG signals in the limb movement intention. An effective method of wavelet coherence was used to analyze the internal correlation between EEG and EMG signals in the same limb movement intention. To further prove the effectiveness of the hypothesis in this paper, six subjects were involved in the experiments. The experimental results demonstrated that there was a strong EEG-EMG coherence at 1 Hz around movement onset, and the phase of EEG was leading the EMG. Both the simulation and experimental results revealed that EEG and EMG are homologous, and the response time of the EEG signals are earlier than EMG signals during the limb movement intention. This work can provide a theoretical basis for the feasibility of EEG-based pre-perception and fusion perception of EEG and EMG in human movement detection.

Seizure Detection Based on EEG Signals Using Asymmetrical Back Propagation Neural Network Method	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Epileptic disorders; Neural network; Back propagation		Abnormal activity in the human brain is a symptom of epilepsy. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a standard tool that has been widely used to detect seizures. A number of automated seizure detection systems based on EEG signal classification have been employed in present days, which includes a mixture of approaches but most of them rely on time signal features, time intervals or time frequency domains. Therefore, in this research, deep learning-based automated mechanism is introduced to improve the seizure detection accuracy from EEG signal using the Asymmetrical Back Propagation Neural Network (ABPN) method. The ABPN system includes four levels of repetitive training with weight adjustment, feed forward initialization, error and update weight and bias back-propagation. The proposed ABPN-based seizure detection system is validated using Physionet EEG dataset with matlab simulation, and the effectiveness of proposed seizure system is confirmed through simulation results. As compared with Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine-Particle Swarm Optimization (SVM-PSO)-based seizure detection system, the proposed ABPN system gives the best performance against various parameters. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 96.32%, 95.12% and 98.36%, respectively.

One-third of stroke patients may suffer partial visual field loss in both eyes. The relationship between brain oscillation after a unilateral occipital stroke and visual field defect is worth investigating. Decoding resting-state Electroencephalography (EEG) to predict patients' visual field distribution could be an essential reference for a better understanding of the compensation of visual functions after a stroke. The result could be beneficial for clinical diagnostics and treatment. This paper proposed a frequency spectrum-based 2D convolutional neural network(CNN) and brain connectivity-based 3DCNN model to predict the visual field defect. The results show that the frequency spectrum-based 2DCNN achieved a higher accuracy on visual field location than the connectivity-based 3DCNN model. Simultaneously, the percentage seems to be not predictable for both domains, and therefore we also explored the patterns of electrophysiological data for feature visualization and interpretation.

In contrast to the classical visual brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms, which adhere to a rigid trial structure and restricted user behavior, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based visual recognition decoding during our daily activities remains challenging. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of decoding the EEG signature of visual recognition in experimental conditions promoting our natural ocular behavior when interacting with our dynamic environment. Approach. In our experiment, subjects visually search for a target object among suddenly appearing objects in the environment while driving a car-simulator. Given that subjects exhibit an unconstrained overt visual behavior, we based our study on eye fixation-related potentials (EFRPs). We report on gaze behavior and single-trial EFRP decoding performance (fixations on visually similar target vs. non-target objects). In addition, we demonstrate the application of our approach in a closed-loop BCI setup. Main results. To identify the target out of four symbol types along a road segment, the BCI system integrated decoding probabilities of multiple EFRP and achieved the average online accuracy of 0.37 +/- 0.06 (12 subjects), statistically significantly above the chance level. Using the acquired data, we performed a comparative study of classification algorithms (discriminating target vs. non-target) and feature spaces in a simulated online scenario. The EEG approaches yielded similar moderate performances of at most 0.6 AUC, yet statistically significantly above the chance level. In addition, the gaze duration (dwell time) appears to be an additional informative feature in this context. Significance. These results show that visual recognition of sudden events can be decoded during active driving. Therefore, this study lays a foundation for assistive and recommender systems based on the driver's brain signals.

Compared with doctors' manual judgment, machine learning methods are faster. However, only when its recognition accuracy reaches a high level can it be used in practice. Due to the difference in the data distributions of the training dataset and the test dataset and the lack of training samples, the classification accuracies of general machine learning algorithms are not satisfactory. In fact, among the many machine learning methods used to process epilepsy electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, most are black box methods; however, in medicine, methods with explanatory power are needed. In response to these three challenges, this paper proposes a novel technique based on domain adaptation learning, semi-supervised learning and a fuzzy system. In detail, we use domain adaptation learning to reduce deviation from the data distribution, semi-supervised learning to compensate for the lack of training samples, and the Takagi-Sugen-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system model to improve interpretability. Our experimental results show that the performance of the new method is better than those of most advanced epilepsy classification methods.

We demonstrate a significant decoding performance improvement by more than 50% during test time for isolated speech recognition task and we also provide preliminary results indicating performance improvement for the more challenging continuous speech recognition task by utilizing EEG features. The results presented in this paper show the first step towards demonstrating the possibility of utilizing non-invasive neural signals to design a real-time robust speech prosthetic for stroke survivors recovering from aphasia, apraxia, and dysarthria. Our aphasia, apraxia, and dysarthria speech-EEG data set will be released to the public to help further advance this interesting and crucial research.

Some academicians developed a series of the syllabus to exploit the brain capability of students by training their weaker hemisphere of the brain. Prior to training the weaker side of the brain with the developed syllabus, the brain dominance of the student shall be determined. All the current methods used to determine brain dominance are questionnaire-based assessments. There is a possibility that questionnaire biases could exist and lead to inaccurate results. In this research, we introduce a deep-learning method to classify brain dominance based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal that reflects the bio-information of the brain. In this paper, we employ a series of EEG signal processing techniques and a state-of-the-art deep learning neural network namely Metric Learning Based Convolutional Neural Network (MLBCNN) to determine brain dominance. We prove that the brain dominance theory is valid and it can be determined by applying machine learning from the EEG signals. We also present the results that show the MLBCNN system can give the best performance as compared to the other benchmark neural network models of which its classification accuracy is 97.44%. Hence, this proposed method can contribute to the education field by providing a system to discover students' brain dominance and keep track of their brain training progress. In this way, the potential and capability of their brain can be fully unleashed.

Most studies have investigated emotions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), including the real-time application in neurofeedback training. However, the electroencephalogram (EEG) is a more suitable tool for therapeutic application. Our study aims at establishing a method to classify discrete complex emotions (e.g., tenderness and anguish) elicited through a near-immersive scenario that can be later used for EEG-neurofeedback. EEG-based affective computing studies have mainly focused on emotion classification based on dimensions, commonly using passive elicitation through single-modality stimuli. Here, we integrated both passive and active elicitation methods. We recorded electrophysiological data during emotion-evoking trials, combining emotional self-induction with a multimodal virtual environment. We extracted correlational and time-frequency features, including frontal-alpha asymmetry (FAA), using Complex Morlet Wavelet convolution. Thinking about future real-time applications, we performed within-subject classification using 1-s windows as samples and we applied trial-specific cross-validation. We opted for a traditional machine-learning classifier with low computational complexity and sufficient validation in online settings, the Support Vector Machine. Results of individual-based cross-validation using the whole feature sets showed considerable between-subject variability. The individual accuracies ranged from 59.2 to 92.9% using time-frequency/FAA and 62.4 to 92.4% using correlational features. We found that features of the temporal, occipital, and left-frontal channels were the most discriminative between the two emotions. Our results show that the suggested pipeline is suitable for individual-based classification of discrete emotions, paving the way for future personalized EEG-neurofeedback training.</p>	[De Filippi, Eleonora; Deco, Gustavo] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Computat Neurosci Grp, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Barcelona, Spain; [Wolter, Mara; Melo, Bruno R.

One of the critical states of the brain is drowsiness. Physical, mental tiredness, and unconsciousness are some of the reasons for drowsiness. Drowsiness state may lead to fatal crashes, severe injury, and property damage; sometimes, it can be analyzed and detected by using EEG. Analyzing EEG signals is complicated and tedious, so an automated diagnosis is required to interpret these signals effectively. In recent years, finding drowsy feeling while working has become an important research area. In this paper, the authors reviewed various drowsiness detection techniques in the literature and analyzed the performance of 15 different machine learning algorithms for the self-acquired feature set from the EEG.

The continuous video electroencephalogram (v-EEG) is the gold standard for monitoring neonatal seizures, but it requires specialized equipment and expert staff available 24/24h. The purpose of this study is to present an overview of the main Neonatal Seizure Detection (NSD) systems developed during the last ten years that implement Artificial Intelligence techniques to detect and report the temporal occurrence of neonatal seizures. Expert systems based on the analysis of EEG, ECG and video recordings are investigated, and their usefulness as support tools for the medical staff in detecting and diagnosing neonatal seizures in NICUs is evaluated. EEG-based NSD systems show better performance than systems based on other signals. Recently ECG analysis, particularly the related HRV analysis, seems to be a promising marker of brain damage. Moreover, video analysis could be helpful to identify inconspicuous but pathological movements. This study highlights possible future developments of the NSD systems: a multimodal approach that exploits and combines the results of the EEG, ECG and video approaches and a system able to automatically characterize etiologies might provide additional support to clinicians in seizures diagnosis.

Most BCIs are guided only by visual feedback and do not have somatosensory feedback, which is an important component of normal motor behavior. The sense of touch is a very crucial sensory modality, especially in object recognition and manipulation. When manipulating an object, the brain uses empirical information about the tactile properties of the object. In addition, the primary somatosensory cortex is not only involved in processing the sense of touch in our body but also responds to visible contact with other people or inanimate objects. Based on these findings, we conducted a preliminary experiment to confirm the possibility of a novel paradigm called touch imagery.

However, most previous name-related studies usually adopted noninvasive EEG or fMRI recordings, which were limited by low spatial resolution and temporal resolution, respectively, and thus millisecond-level response latencies in precise brain regions could not be measured using these noninvasive recordings. By invasive stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings that have high resolution in both the spatial and temporal domain, the current study distinguished the neural response to one's own name or a stranger's name, and explored common active brain regions in both auditory and visual modalities. The neural activities were classified using spatiotemporal features of high-gamma, beta, and alpha band. Results showed that different names could be decoded using multi-region SEEG signals, and the best classification performance was achieved at high gamma (60-145 Hz) band. In this case, auditory and visual modality-based name classification accuracies were 84.5 +/- 8.3 and 79.9 +/- 4.6%, respectively. Additionally, some single regions such as the supramarginal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and insula could also achieve remarkable accuracies for both modalities, supporting their roles in the processing of self-related information. The average latency of the difference between the two responses in these precise regions was 354 +/- 63 and 285 +/- 59 ms in the auditory and visual modality, respectively. This study suggested that name recognition was attributed to a distributed brain network, and the subsets with decoding capabilities might be potential implanted regions for awareness detection and cognition evaluation.

Combining Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning for EEG Scalp Topograms Classification	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG topograms; convolutional neural network; CNN; ambiguous stimuli; pre-trained decoder	IMAGERY; ADAPTATION; CORTEX	Incorporating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) into daily life requires reducing the reliance of decoding algorithms on the calibration or enabling calibration with the minimal burden on the user. A potential solution could be a pre-trained decoder demonstrating a reasonable accuracy on the naive operators. Addressing this issue, we considered ambiguous stimuli classification tasks and trained an artificial neural network to classify brain responses to the stimuli of low and high ambiguity. We built a pre-trained classifier utilizing time-frequency features corresponding to the fundamental neurophysiological processes shared between subjects. To extract these features, we statistically contrasted electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral power between the classes in the representative group of subjects. As a result, the pre-trained classifier achieved 74% accuracy on the data of newly recruited subjects. Analysis of the literature suggested that a pre-trained classifier could help naive users to start using BCI bypassing training and further increased accuracy during the feedback session. Thus, our results contribute to using BCI during paralysis or limb amputation when there is no explicit user-generated kinematic output to properly train a decoder. In machine learning, our approach may facilitate the development of transfer learning (TL) methods for addressing the cross-subject problem. It allows extracting the interpretable feature subspace from the source data (the representative group of subjects) related to the target data (a naive user), preventing the negative transfer in the cross-subject tasks.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end shallow and lightweight CNN framework, which allows EEG-Motor Raw dataset as inputs, to boost decoding accuracy by the Channel-Mixing-ConvNet. The first block of network is designed in the way of implicitly stacking temporal-spatial convolution layers for learning temporal and spatial EEG features after EEG channels were mixed, compared to previously independently building a single temporal and spatial convolutional layer, this method combines the feature extraction capabilities of the two layers. The Mixed Channel Process block introducing a depthwise convolution layer is applied for a series of processing such as to decouple and supplement the internal and external mapping relationships existing in the mixed multi-dimensional EEG feature maps. Finally, the classification block is constructed to finish EEG decoding tasks. The lightweight architecture of Channel-Mixing-ConvNet leaves space for the model to exploit its potential performance by stacking other layers. In our experiments, the proposed Channel-Mixing-ConvNet and variants based on different hyper-parameters were evaluated on public EEG-motor datasets BCI-IV 2a and HGD respectively, Channel-Mixing-ConvNet outperformed state-of-the art (SOA) algorithms for EEG decoding. Additionally, via post-hoc interpretation techniques, the results show the learned features are consistent with the neurophysiological principle of the EEG motor imagery, meanwhile, the model also captures the remarkable features associated with channels.

Among these research fields, the brain-computer interface (BCI) research, which studies the direct interaction between the brain and external devices, is in the spotlight. However, in the case of electroencephalograph (EEG) data measured through BCI, there are a huge number of features, which can lead to many difficulties in analysis because of complex relationships between features. For this reason, research on BCIs using EEG data is often insufficient. Therefore, in this study, we develop the methodology for selecting features for a specific type of BCI that predicts whether a person correctly detects facial expression changes or not by classifying EEG-based features. We also investigate whether specific EEG features affect expression change detection. Various feature selection methods were used to check the influence of each feature on expression change detection, and the best combination was selected using several machine learning classification techniques. As a best result of the classification accuracy, 71% of accuracy was obtained with XGBoost using 52 features. EEG topography was confirmed using the selected major features, showing that the detection of changes in facial expression largely engages brain activity in the frontal regions.

A public-domain library with emotion-annotated images (IAPS) was used to stimulate neutral, negative, and positive emotions. The associated EEG data were acquired from twelve volunteers (between 20 and 26 years old; ten males and two females). Each participant was exposed to three sessions back-toback on the same day. Each session corresponded to the induced emotional states (positive, negative and neutral) and consisted of relaxation, memorization of a list of ten words and ten numbers, watching a set of images to arouse emotion, and recalling the words and numbers memorized earlier. Statistical and spectral features of EEG data were analyzed for two instances: emotion recognition (neutral, negative, and positive) and recall events under the three emotional states. By designing two baseline machine-learning models, support vector machines (SVMs) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), the significance of the EEG bands and the brain lobes were studied. Experimental results suggest that the short-term (working) memory recalls after exposure to neutral, negative, and positive images (to arouse neutral, negative, and positive emotions) differ from each other significantly (at alpha level 0.001). We have found that each EEG band carries unique information in both emotion and memory recall classification tasks and recommend that the entire EEG signal frequency range must be analyzed in future similar studies. On the other hand, we also have found that each brain region carries similar information as it relates to each task (i.e., memorization, recall), thus only one of the brain regions can be analyzed in future studies in order to avoid complexity and high computation time.

Two major challenges for BCI are accurate interpretation of neural activity and signal processing speed for real-time applications i.e. correctly decode a user's intent and the timely execution of that intent. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has advantages over Electroencephalography (EEG) with respect to spatial and temporal resolution which could potentially allow better decoding of brain activity. High spatial and temporal resolution using MEG generates a large volume of data which must be rapidly preprocessed and classified correctly for practical real-time BCI. This paper presents a simple data processing technique to clean, normalise and reduce data dimensionality, for optimal class label decoding using a simple Logistic Regression classifier. Good decoding performance was achieved using an off-line MEG dataset, with or without data dimensionality reduction, comparable to more complex data pre-processing methods and classifiers already studied.

Most studies that have attempted to decode speech have used scalp electroencephalography or electrocorticography. Only few studies have used stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG), which enables the exploration of deeply located structures in the brain, in this context. In this paper, we aim to identify discriminative features for decoding speech perception and overt and imagined speech production from SEEG recordings in three patients with epilepsy. We report results for the detection of speech events and for the classification of the corresponding utterances.

However, there are limited studies comparing their proposed feature selection framework performance on both objective and subjective datasets. Therefore, this study aims to provide a novel framework that combines spatial filters at various frequency bands with double-layered feature selection and evaluates it on published and self-acquired datasets. Electroencephalography (EEG) data are preprocessed and decomposed into multiple frequency sub-bands, whose features are then extracted, calculated, and ranked based on Fisher's ratio and minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance (mRmR) algorithm. Informative filter banks are chosen for optimal classification by linear discriminative analysis (LDA). The results of the study, firstly, show that the proposed method is comparable to other conventional methods through accuracy and F1-score. The study also found that hand vs. feet classification is more discriminable than left vs. right hand (4-10% difference). Lastly, the performance of the filter banks common spatial pattern (FBCSP, without feature selection) algorithm is found to be significantly lower (p = 0.0029, p = 0.0015, and p = 0.0008) compared to that of the proposed method when applied to small-sized data.

Currently Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most popular tool to inspect the existence of neurological disorders like autism biomarkers due to its low setup cost, high temporal resolution and wide availability. Generally, EEG recordings produce vast amount of data with dynamic behavior, which are visually analyzed by professional clinician to detect autism. It is laborious, expensive, subjective, error prone and has reliability issue. Therefor this study intends to develop an efficient diagnostic framework based on time-frequency spectrogram images of EEG signals to automatically identify ASD. In the proposed system, primarily, the raw EEG signals are pre-processed using re-referencing, filtering and normalization. Then, Short-Time Fourier Transform is used to transform the pre-processed signals into two-dimensional spectrogram images. Afterward those images are evaluated by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, separately. In the ML process, textural features are extracted, and significant features are selected using principal component analysis, and feed them to six different ML classifiers for classification. In the DL process, three different convolutional neural network models are tested. The proposed DL based model achieves higher accuracy (99.15%) compared to the ML based model (95.25%) on an ASD EEG dataset and also outperforms existing methods. The findings of this study suggest that the DL based structure could discover important biomarkers for efficient and automatic diagnosis of ASD from EEG and may assist to develop computer-aided diagnosis system.

J	Tan, C; Sarlija, M; Kasabov, N				Tan, Clarence; Sarlija, Marko; Kasabov, Nikola			NeuroSense: Short-term emotion recognition and understanding based on spiking neural network modelling of spatio-temporal EEG patterns	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Spiking neural networks; Emotion recognition; Affective computing; EEG; Event detection	CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; NEURONS	Emotion recognition still poses a challenge lying at the core of the rapidly growing area of affective com-puting and is crucial for establishing a successful human-computer interaction. Identification and under-standing of emotions are achieved through various measures, such as subjective self-reports, face-tracking, voice analysis, gaze-tracking, as well as the analysis of autonomic and central neurophysiolog-ical measurements. Current approaches to emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) mostly rely on various handcrafted features extracted over relatively long time windows of EEG during participants exposure to appropriate affective stimuli. In this paper, we present a short-term emotion recognition framework based on spiking neural network (SNN) modelling of spatio-temporal EEG pat-terns. Our method relies on EEG signal segmentation based on detection of short-term changes in facial landmarks, and as such includes no computation of handcrafted EEG features. Differences between par-ticipants' EEG properties are taken into account via subject-dependent spike encoding in the formulated subject-independent emotion recognition task. We test our methods on the publicly available DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI databases due to the availability of both EEG and frontal face video data. Through an exhaustive hyperparameter optimisation strategy, we show that the proposed SNN-based representation of EEG spiking patterns provides valuable information for short-term emotion recognition. The obtained accuracies are 78.97% and 79.39% in arousal classification, and 67.76% and 72.12% in valence classifica-tion, on the DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI datasets, respectively. Furthermore, through the application of a brain-inspired SNN model, this study provides novel insight and helps in the understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in emotional processing in the context of audiovisual stimuli, such as affective videos. The presented results encourage the use of the proposed EEG processing methodology as a com-plement to existing features and methods commonly used for EEG-based emotion recognition, especially for short-term arousal recognition.

The brain cognition laws are summarized by analyzing the EEG power topographic map under the stimulation of three kinds of automobile sound, namely, quality of comfort, powerfulness, and acceleration. Then, the EEG features of the subjects are classified through a machine learning algorithm, by which the recognition of diversified automobile sound is realized. In addition, the Kalman smoothing and minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR) algorithm is used to improve the recognition accuracy. The results show that there are differences in the neural characteristics of diversified automobile sound quality, with a positive correlation between EEG energy and sound intensity. Furthermore, by using the Kalman smoothing and mRMR algorithm, recognition accuracy is improved, and the amount of calculation is reduced. The novel idea and method to explore the cognitive laws of automobile sound quality from the field of brain-computer interface technology are provided in this study.

J	Xu, MY; Yao, JF; Ni, HL				Xu, Meiyan; Yao, Junfeng; Ni, Hualiang			Dual Head and Dual Attention in Deep Learning for End-to-End EEG Motor Imagery Classification	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						machine learning; brain machine interface; attention; motor imagery; classification	FILTER BANK; NETWORK	Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) or Electroencephalogram (EEG) wavelet is essential for motor imagery (MI) classification and BMI (Brain-Machine Interface) application. However, it is difficult to recognize multiple tasks for non-trained subjects that are indispensable for the complexities of the task or the uncertainties in the environment. The subject-independent scenario, where an inter-subject trained model can be directly applied to new users without precalibration, is particularly desired. Therefore, this paper focuses on an effective attention mechanism which can be applied to a subject-independent set to learn EEG motor imagery features. Firstly, a custom form of sequence inputs with spatial and temporal dimensions is adopted for dual headed attention via deep convolution net (DHDANet). Secondly, DHDANet simultaneously learns temporal and spacial features. The features of spacial attention on each input head are divided into two parts for spatial attentional learning subsequently. The proposed model is validated based on the EEG-MI signals collected from 54 subjects in two sessions with 200 trials in each sessions. The classification of left and right hand motor imagery in this paper achieves an average accuracy of 75.52%, a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the visualization of the frequency analysis method demonstrates that the temporal-convolution and spectral-attention is capable of identifying the ERD for EEG-MI. The proposed machine learning structure enables cross-session and cross-subject classification and makes significant progress in the BMI transfer learning problem.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have the potential to detect stress levels reliably due to their high accuracy. Majority of studies of stress detection are based on alpha and beta waves and the corresponding ratio of the two waves and there are hardly any based-on theta waves. This work explores the impact of bandpower of alpha/beta and theta/beta ratios when combined with other features to classify two-levels of human stress based on EEG signals using five commonly used machine learning algorithms. A classification model is developed from the clustering model gained and Naive Bayes shows the highest accuracy which is 95% in compared to the other four common machine learning algorithms (i.e., SVM, Logistic, IBk, and SGD) by using WEKA. The proposed framework recommends that both ratios are reliable features, and theta/beta appears to give a huge impact compared to alpha/beta. This study will ultimately contribute to society's development with improved robust machine learning algorithm for binary classification.	[Altaf, Hunain; Ibrahim, S. Noorjannah; Azmin, N. F.

We developed a qEEG-ML algorithm to predict A beta pathology among subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and validated it using A beta PET. We compared QEEG data between patients with MCI and those with SCD with and without PET-confirmed beta-amyloid plaque. We compared resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalograms (EEG) patterns between the amyloid positive and negative groups using relative power measures from 19 channels (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2), divided into eight frequency bands, delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10 Hz), alpha 2 (10-12 Hz), beta 1 (12-15 Hz), beta 2 (15-20 Hz), beta 3 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz) calculated by FFT and denoised by iSyncBrain(R). The resulting 152 features were analyzed using a genetic algorithm strategy to identify optimal feature combinations and maximize classification accuracy. Guided by gene modeling methods, we treated each channel and frequency band of EEG power as a gene and modeled it with every possible combination within a given dimension. We then collected the models that showed the best performance and identified the genes that appeared most frequently in the superior models. By repeating this process, we converged on a model that approximates the optimum. We found that the average performance increased as this iterative development of the genetic algorithm progressed. We ultimately achieved 85.7% sensitivity, 89.3% specificity, and 88.6% accuracy in SCD amyloid positive/negative classification, and 83.3% sensitivity, 85.7% specificity, and 84.6% accuracy in MCI amyloid positive/negative classification.

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are used to diagnose epileptic seizures. This paper provides a computer-aided diagnosis system (CADS) for the automatic diagnosis of epileptic seizures in EEG signals. The proposed method consists of three steps, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In order to perform the simulations, the Bonn and Freiburg datasets are used. Firstly, we used a band-pass filter with 0.5-40 Hz cut-off frequency for removal artifacts of the EEG datasets. Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT) is used for EEG signal decomposition. In the second step, various linear and nonlinear features are extracted from TQWT sub-bands. In this step, various statistical, frequency, and nonlinear features are extracted from the sub-bands. The nonlinear features used are based on fractal dimensions (FDs) and entropy theories. In the classification step, different approaches based on conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are discussed. In this step, a CNN-RNN-based DL method with the number of layers proposed is applied. The extracted features have been fed to the input of the proposed CNN-RNN model, and satisfactory results have been reported. In the classification step, the K-fold cross-validation with k = 10 is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-RNN classification procedure. The results revealed that the proposed CNN-RNN method for Bonn and Freiburg datasets achieved an accuracy of 99.71% and 99.13%, respectively.

In particular, the success of entropic measures for this purpose is very appealing, considering (1) their suitability for capturing both linear and non-linear characteristics of brain activity recordings and (2) their direct association with the brain signal variability. These findings rely on external stimuli to induce the brain stress response. On the other hand, research suggests that the use of different types of experimentally induced psychological and physical stressors could potentially yield differential impacts on the brain response to stress and therefore should be dissociated from more general patterns. The present study takes a step toward addressing this issue by introducing conditional entropy (CE) as a potential electroencephalography (EEG)-based resting-state digital marker of stress. For this purpose, we use the resting-state multi-channel EEG recordings of 20 individuals whose responses to stress-related questionnaires show significantly higher and lower level of stress. Through the application of representational similarity analysis (RSA) and K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classification, we verify the potential that the use of CE can offer to the solution concept of finding an effective digital marker for stress.

They differ from each other in several aspects, from data acquisition to machine learning algorithms, due to which, a comparison between different implementations is often difficult. This review article puts together all the relevant works published in the last decade on decoding imagined speech from EEG into a single framework. Every important aspect of designing such a system, such as selection of words to be imagined, number of electrodes to be recorded, temporal and spatial filtering, feature extraction and classifier are reviewed. This helps a researcher to compare the relative merits and demerits of the different approaches and choose the one that is most optimal. Speech being the most natural form of communication which human beings acquire even without formal education, imagined speech is an ideal choice of prompt for evoking brain activity patterns for a BCI (brain-computer interface) system, although the research on developing real-time (online) speech imagery based BCI systems is still in its infancy. Covert speech based BCI can help people with disabilities to improve their quality of life. It can also be used for covert communication in environments that do not support vocal communication. This paper also discusses some future directions, which will aid the deployment of speech imagery based BCI for practical applications, rather than only for laboratory experiments.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has proven to be an effective modality for emotion recognition, with which user affective states can be tracked and recorded, especially for primitive emotional events such as arousal and valence. Although brain signals have been shown to correlate with emotional states, the effectiveness of proposed models is somewhat limited. The challenge is improving accuracy, while appropriate extraction of valuable features might be a key to success. This study proposes a framework based on incorporating fractal dimension features and recursive feature elimination approach to enhance the accuracy of EEG-based emotion recognition. The fractal dimension and spectrum-based features to be extracted and used for more accurate emotional state recognition. Recursive Feature Elimination will be used as a feature selection method, whereas the classification of emotions will be performed by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The proposed framework will be tested with a widely used public database, and results are expected to demonstrate higher accuracy and robustness compared to other studies. The contributions of this study are primarily about the improvement of the EEG-based emotion classification accuracy. There is a potential restriction of how generic the results can be as different EEG dataset might yield different results for the same framework. Therefore, experimenting with different EEG dataset and testing alternative feature selection schemes can be very interesting for future work.

Recently, due to the popularity of end-to-end deep learning, the applicability of algorithms such as con-volutional neural networks (CNN) has been explored to achieve the mentioned tasks. This paper presents an improved and compact CNN algorithm for motor imagery decoding based on the adaptation of SincNet, which was initially developed for speaker recognition task from the raw audio input. Such adaptation allows for a compact end-to-end neural network with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and enables network interpretability for neurophysiological validation in cortical rhythms and spatial analysis. In order to vali-date the performance of proposed algorithms, two datasets were used; the first is the pub-licly available BCI Competition IV dataset 2a, which was often used as a benchmark in validating motor imagery classification algorithms, and the second is a dataset consists of primary data initially collected to study the difference between motor imagery and mental-task associated motor imagery BCI and was used to test the plausibility of the pro-posed algorithm in highlighting the differences in terms of cortical rhythms. Competitive decoding performance was achieved in both datasets in comparisons with SOTA CNN mod -els, albeit with the lowest number of trainable parameters. In addition, it was shown that the proposed architecture performs a cleaner band-pass, highlighting the necessary fre-quency bands that were crucial and neurophysiologically plausible in solving the classifica-tion tasks.

Correlations between neural activity during encoding and subsequent retrieval performance have implicated such "subsequent memory effects" (SMEs) as important for understanding the neural basis of memory formation. Uncontrolled variability in external factors that also predict memory performance. however, confounds the interpretation of these effects. By controlling for a comprehensive set of external variables, we investigated the extent to which neural correlates of successful memory encoding reflect variability in endogenous brain states. We show that external variables that reliably predict memory performance have relatively small effects on electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of successful memory encoding. Instead, the brain activity that is diagnostic of successful encoding primarily reflects fluctuations in endogenous neural activity. These findings link neural activity during learning to endogenous states that drive variability in human cognition.

Research on developing HCI systems using brain wave signals has progressed a lot over the years. However, real-time implementation, computational complexity and accuracy are still a concern. In this work, we address the problem of selecting the appropriate filtering frequency band while also achieving a good system performance by proposing a frequency-based approach using long short-term memory network (LSTM) for recognizing different brain wave signals. Adaptive filtering using genetic algorithm is incorporated for a hybrid system utilizing common spatial pattern and LSTM network. The proposed method (OPTICAL+) achieved an overall average classification error rate of 30.41% and a kappa coefficient value of 0.398, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed OPTICAL+ predictor can be used to develop improved HCI systems that will aid in neurorehabilitation and may also be beneficial for sleep stage classification and seizure detection.

The Necessity of Leave One Subject Out (LOSO) Cross Validation for EEG Disease Diagnosis	BRAIN INFORMATICS, BI 2021	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Brain Informatics (BI)	SEP 17-19, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			EEG; MLP; Machine learning; Classification; Cross-subject classification; Leave one subject out; LOSO	CLASSIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DISORDER	High variability between individual subjects and recording sessions is a known fact about scalp recorded EEG signal. While some do, the majority of the EEG based machine learning studies do not attempt to assess performance of algorithms across recording sessions or across subjects, instead studies use the whole data-set available for training and testing, using an established k-fold cross validation technique and thus missing performance in a real-life setting on an unseen subject. This study primarily aimed to show how important is to have a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) evaluation done for any scalp recorded EEG based machine learning. This study also demonstrates effectiveness of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in getting good LOSO accuracy from balanced, clean EEG data, without any pre-processing in comparison with traditional machine learning algorithms. The study used data from participants diagnosed with schizophrenia, as well as a group of participants with no known neurological disorder. Classification was done using traditional methods and MLP to classify the participants as belonging to disease or control subjects. Results shows that 85% accuracy on unseen subject was achievable from a clean data-set. MLP is seen to be effective in finding features by which schizophrenia could be detected from clean EEG data. LOSO evaluation done with this proven MLP configuration using carefully and intentionally corrupted data clearly indicate that for disease diagnosis, the k-fold classification result is misleading.

The non-synchronism between the learning state and after-learning investigation also reduces the accuracy. We propose a new method to evaluate learners' learning immersion based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and support vector machine (SVM). We construct 2 learning scenarios to induce immersive senses: VR video learning for high-level immersion and online English word learning for low-level immersion. To distinguish two immersion levels, students' EEGs are collected. After entering their attention score, relaxation score, the synchronization rate between the 2 scores, high alpha and low beta wave into SVM model, the precision accuracy reaches 87.80%. Taken the classified results and the participants' self-reports together, we find VR devices can create a more immersive environment which improves learners' learning effect. Our findings provide evidence supporting the feasibility of predicting learning immersion levels by physiological recordings.

This hinders the promotion of some automatic epilepsy detection methods in clinical practice. In order to solve this problem, we proposed an epilepsy detection method based on generalized convolutional prototype learning (GCPL). GCPL maps EEG samples to the regions close to the prototype in the feature space, which is more suitable for the classification of clinical EEG signals with diverse quality and pattern. Moreover, it can overcome the impact of the change of discriminative features caused by different datasets on the classification performance, which shows more robustness. In the experiments, the proposed method could reach a sensitivity of 98.75%, a specificity 100% of and an accuracy 99.38%, respectively on the clinical dataset. GCPL can complete a test within 2 s, which meets the actual clinical needs.

This study is aimed at systematically investigating the robustness of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning based EEG-BCI models for motor imagery classification against simulated channel-specific noise in EEG data, at various low values of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our results illustrate higher robustness of deep learning based MI classification models compared to the traditional machine learning based model, while identifying a set of channels with large sensitivity to simulated channel-specific noise. The EEGNet is relatively more robust towards channel-specific noise than Shallow ConvNet and FBCSP. We propose a preliminary solution, based on activation function, to improve the robustness of the deep learning models. By using saturating nonlinearities, the percentage drop in classification accuracy for SNR of -18 dB had reduced from 10.99% to 6.53% for EEGNet and 14.05% to 3.57% for Shallow ConvNet. Through this study, we emphasize the need for a more precise solution for enhancing the robustness, and thereby usability of EEG-BCI systems.

Consequently, support for nursing care using information and communications technology is indispensable to not only overcome the challenges posed by a shortage of caregivers but also improve the quality of life (QoL) of care recipients. Studies on silent speech brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are underway to facilitate communication with care recipients who have lost their language faculty or suffer from aphasia. This technology hypothesizes what a care recipient is attempting to communicate through electroencephalographic analysis when attempting to speak without actually speaking. If such a technology is realized, it can be used to not only support communication with care recipients who cannot speak, but also alleviate the burden on caregivers and improve the QoL of care recipients by expanding the activities they can perform independently. This study shows a method of performing electroencephalographic analysis when a person is imagining a vowel sound to realize a silent speech BCI nursing care support system. This system employs electroencephalography (EEG). Experiments were performed by attaching eight electrodes to the left temporal lobes of the subjects, measuring brain waves when each subject was imagining six sounds, i.e., "a/i/u/e/o/mute," and performing analysis using four methods: support vector machine, decision tree, linear discriminant analysis, which is a commonly used machine-learning algorithm, and long short-term memory (LSTM), which is an extensively investigated deep learning model. The performance of the system was evaluated with four healthy male subjects (ages 23-24). Consequently, a classification accuracy of 86.9% was obtained using LSTM. In addition, the application of this method to biometric identification was investigated. Consequently, an accuracy of 99.1% for individual EEG classification was obtained with LSTM, indicating the feasibility of a biometric authentication system using EEG during vowel recall.

Essential hand functionality includes movements such as wrist extension and flexion, finger extension and flexion and tripod pinch. There are a limited number of EEG studies focusing on the combination of these movements. A novel grouping of these movements was investigated in the current study: i.e., right wrist, right finger, left wrist and left finger movements. The associated EEG was discriminated in a novel four-class BCI problem. Real and imagined movement data was recorded from healthy test subjects. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used as a spatial filter. Time-frequency-based features were extracted from the mu and beta EEG frequency bands. A subset of features were selected using the Bhattacharya distance. Two classifier configurations were compared i.e., a single-stage four-class classifier architecture and a two-stage four-class architecture. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, Mahalanobis distance clustering and a group classifier were compared within these architectures. The two-stage group classifier performed best with average accuracies of 68% and 62% for the real and imagined movements respectively. These results imply a possibility of multiclass EEG discrimination of hand movements. Time-frequency plots of the selected features suggest that different underlying neural mechanisms control wrist and finger movements. This study implies that an EEG-based BCI can control more degrees of freedom of a prosthetic or orthotic hand.

Predicting Exact Valence and Arousal Values from EEG	SENSORS			English	Article						arousal and valence prediction; EEG; emotion recognition; comparative study	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; EMOTION RECOGNITION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; DATABASE; SIGNALS	Recognition of emotions from physiological signals, and in particular from electroencephalography (EEG), is a field within affective computing gaining increasing relevance. Although researchers have used these signals to recognize emotions, most of them only identify a limited set of emotional states (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, etc.) and have not attempted to predict exact values for valence and arousal, which would provide a wider range of emotional states. This paper describes our proposed model for predicting the exact values of valence and arousal in a subject-independent scenario. To create it, we studied the best features, brain waves, and machine learning models that are currently in use for emotion classification. This systematic analysis revealed that the best prediction model uses a KNN regressor (K = 1) with Manhattan distance, features from the alpha, beta and gamma bands, and the differential asymmetry from the alpha band. Results, using the DEAP, AMIGOS and DREAMER datasets, show that our model can predict valence and arousal values with a low error (MAE < 0.06, RMSE < 0.16) and a strong correlation between predicted and expected values (PCC > 0.80), and can identify four emotional classes with an accuracy of 84.4%. The findings of this work show that the features, brain waves and machine learning models, typically used in emotion classification tasks, can be used in more challenging situations, such as the prediction of exact values for valence and arousal.

This study aims to decode five natural reach-and-grasp types using sources of movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) and investigate their difference in cortical signal characteristics and network structures. Electroencephalogram signals were gathered from 40 channels of eight healthy subjects. In an audio cue-based experiment, subjects were instructed to keep no-movement condition or perform five natural reach-and-grasp movements: palmar, pinch, push, twist and plug. We projected MRCP into source space and used average source amplitudes in 24 regions of interest as classification features. Besides, functional connectivity was calculated using phase locking value. Six-class classification results showed that a similar grand average peak performance of 49.35% can be achieved using source features, with only two-thirds of the number of channel features. Besides, source imaging maps and brain networks presented different patterns between each condition. Grasping pattern analysis indicated that the modules in the execution stage focus more on internal communication than in the planning stage. The former stage was related to the parietal lobe, whereas the latter was associated with the frontal lobe. This study demonstrates the superiority and effectiveness of source imaging technology and reveals the spread mechanism and network structure of five natural reach-and-grasp movements. We believe that our work will contribute to the understanding of the generation mechanism of grasping movement and promote a natural and intuitive control of brain-computer interface.

Recent research investigated the neural processes reflecting the planning of driving actions, aiming to better understand the factors leading to driving errors and to devise methodologies to anticipate and prevent such errors by monitoring the driver's cognitive state and intention. While such anticipation was shown for discrete driving actions, such as emergency braking, there is no evidence for robust neural signatures of continuous action planning. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating continuous steering actions during a driving task in a car simulator with multimodal recordings of behavioural and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. System identification is used to assess whether robust neurophysiological signatures emerge before steering actions. Linear decoding models are then used to determine whether such cortical signals can predict continuous steering actions with progressively longer anticipation. Results point to significant EEG signatures of continuous action planning. Such neural signals show consistent dynamics across participants for anticipations up to 1 s, while individual-subject neural activity could reliably decode steering actions and predict future actions for anticipations up to 1.8 s. Finally, we use canonical correlation analysis to attempt disentangling brain and non-brain contributors to the EEG-based decoding. Our results suggest that low-frequency cortical dynamics are involved in the planning of steering actions and that EEG is sensitive to that neural activity. As a result, we propose a framework to investigate anticipatory neural activity in realistic continuous motor tasks.

This makes music an excellent choice for designing a user-friendly brain-computer interface (BCI) for long-term use. We propose a novel BCI system using music stimuli that relies on brain signals collected via Smartfones, an EEG recording device integrated into a pair of headphones. In a user study of the proposed system, participants were asked to pay attention to one of three musical instruments playing simultaneously from separate spatial directions. We used a stimulus reconstruction method to decode attention from EEG signals. Results show that the proposed system can achieve good decoding accuracy (>70%) while providing superior user-friendliness compared to a traditional EEG setup.

In our experiment Bonn University single-channel intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) and Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) multichannel scalp EEG (sEEG) recordings are considered to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. The VMD is applied on chaotic, non-stationary, nonlinear, and complex EEG signal to decompose it into three band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs). The Hilbert transform (HT) is applied on BLIMFs to extract informative spectral and temporal features. The ApEn is computed from the raw EEG signals as the privileged information and given to the multi-hidden layer structure to obtain the most discriminative compressed form. The scatter plots show the distinct nature of compressed privileged ApEn information among the seizure pattern classes. The linear as well as nonlinear mapping, local and global kernel function, high-learning speed, less computationally complex MMRVFLN+ classifier is proposed to recognize the seizure events accurately by importing the efficacious features with ApEn as the input. The advanced signal processing algorithm i.e., Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) with ApEn and MMRVFLN+ are combined to compare the performance with the proposed VMDHTApEn-MMRVFLN+ method. The proposed method has remarkable recognition ability, superior classification accuracy, and excellent overall performance as compared to other methods. The digital architecture of the multifuse MMRVFLN+ is developed and implemented on a high-speed reconfigurable FPGA hardware platform to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The superior classification accuracy, the negligible false positive rate per hour (FPR/h), simplicity, feasibility, robustness, and practicability of the proposed method validate its ability to recognize the epileptic seizure epochs automatically.

BCI has become a well-established technique to control external devices and consequently help people in their everyday life. During the years many approaches have been explored in terms of neurological information, feature extraction, signal processing, and intention prediction. Two novel aspects are becoming increasingly interesting for the BCI community, i.e. BC modeling and ML techniques. The former aims at describing the interactions among different brain regions as connectivity patterns that reflect the dynamics of information flow at rest or when performing a task. The latter is becoming pervasive for its capability of modeling and predicting complex scenarios where a huge amount of data is involved. These aspects are relevant when considered by themselves, but become crucial assets when combined together. In this scenario, our research idea consists in identifying how the information in the two domains can be merged in a whole entity under a theoretical point of view: BC and ML applied to Electroencephalography (EEG) signals could provide the generalization capability, high accuracy and minimal computational time that allow researchers to build a reliable BCI capable to operate online.

Such a system can be utilized in many ways. The concept of emotions is itself complex and fuzzy in nature. Therefore, to handle the fuzziness of individual's emotional experiences and presenting them as a discrete emotion is all that is required by many EEG-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. In this work, we present an RFID-based BCI system for Emotion classification from EEG patterns. The presented system uses a fuzzy inference system (FIS) that utilizes the valence and arousal modalities to model the individual's emotion. The major steps of the system are: preprocessing recorded EEG patterns and saving them with individual's identification using RFID tags, then preprocessed EEG patterns are decomposed into different frequency bands using wavelet decomposition, followed by feature extraction step, feature matrix so obtained is used for training a k-nearest neighbor model to generate valence and arousal values for given EEG patterns. The output of KNN is fed to the FIS which models the pattern as a discrete emotion. system gives a new dimension to the BCI-based content servers and can also be used in healthcare services which is the need of the hour.

But it is a challenging task owing to the non-stationarity of the EEG signals. Extracting relevant features through signal processing techniques that can be used to classify patterns in the EEG signal leading to different emotions is a difficult task. A dataset for emotion analysis with physiological signals DEAP [1] consists of EEG signals of 32 participants are categorized on the quadrant of valence, arousal, dominance, and liking, which signifies how they are associated with different emotions. In this paper, an efficient classifier for emotion/quadrant recognition from EEG signals with exceptional accuracy is presented. The data preprocessing strategy adapted is Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), which decomposes the signals into several oscillatory Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Features are extracted from Second order difference plots (SODP) are area, mean, and central tendency measure of the elliptical region. Wilcoxson Test was performed to ensure the statistical significance of the extracted features with p < 0.05. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and 2-hidden layer Multilayer Perceptron is used for binary and multi-class classification of emotions in the quadrant of valence, arousal, dominance, and liking. The performance of the models is evaluated by statistical parameters- sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The classification results from Multilayer Perceptron outperformed that of SVM, and the maximum accuracy achieved, is 100 % in the binary classification of High and Low Arousal space.

It has been shown that sleep arousal serves as a good indicator for scoring sleep quality. However, patients are conventionally asked to perform overnight polysomnography tests to collect their physiological data, which are used for the manual judging of sleep arousals. Even worse, not only is this process time-consuming and cumbersome, the judgment of sleep-arousal events is subjective and differs widely from expert to expert. Therefore, this work focuses on designing an automatic sleep-arousal detector that necessitates only a single-lead electroencephalogram signal. Based on the stacking ensemble learning framework, the automatic sleep-arousal detector adopts a meta-classifier that stacks four sub-models: one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, merged convolutional and recurrent networks, and random forest classifiers. This meta-classifier exploits both advantages from deep learning networks and conventional machine learning algorithms to enhance its performance. The embedded information for discriminating the sleep-arousals is extracted from waveform sequences, spectrum characteristics, and expert-defined statistics in single-lead EEG signals. Its effectiveness is evaluated using an open-accessed database, which comprises polysomnograms of 994 individuals, provided by PhysioNet. The improvement of the stacking ensemble learning over a single sub-model was up to 9.29%, 7.79%, 11.03%, 8.61% and 9.04%, respectively, in terms of specificity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

In this paper, we propose a symmetrically weighted local binary patterns (SLBP)-based automated approach for detection of schizophrenia in adolescents from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We extract SLBP-based histogram features from each of the EEG channels. These features are given to a correlation-based feature selection algorithm to get reduced feature vector length. Finally, the feature vector thus obtained is given to LogitBoost classifier to discriminate between schizophrenia and healthy EEG signals. The results validated on the publicly available database suggest that the SLBP effectively characterize the changes in EEG signals and are helpful for the classification of schizophrenia and healthy EEG signals with a classification accuracy of 91.66%. In addition, our approach has provided better results than the recently proposed approaches in schizophrenia detection.	[Rajesh, Kandala N. V. P.

J	Chen, LX; Cichy, RM; Kaiser, D				Chen, Lixiang; Cichy, Radoslaw Martin; Kaiser, Daniel			Semantic Scene-Object Consistency Modulates N300/400 EEG Components, but Does Not Automatically Facilitate Object Representations	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article; Early Access						multivariate pattern analysis; N300; object representation; scene-object consistency	INFORMATION; IDENTIFICATION; INCONSISTENCIES; CONTEXT	During natural vision, objects rarely appear in isolation, but often within a semantically related scene context. Previous studies reported that semantic consistency between objects and scenes facilitates object perception and that scene-object consistency is reflected in changes in the N300 and N400 components in EEG recordings. Here, we investigate whether these N300/400 differences are indicative of changes in the cortical representation of objects. In two experiments, we recorded EEG signals, while participants viewed semantically consistent or inconsistent objects within a scene; in Experiment 1, these objects were task-irrelevant, while in Experiment 2, they were directly relevant for behavior. In both experiments, we found reliable and comparable N300/400 differences between consistent and inconsistent scene-object combinations. To probe the quality of object representations, we performed multivariate classification analyses, in which we decoded the category of the objects contained in the scene. In Experiment 1, in which the objects were not task-relevant, object category could be decoded from similar to 100 ms after the object presentation, but no difference in decoding performance was found between consistent and inconsistent objects. In contrast, when the objects were task-relevant in Experiment 2, we found enhanced decoding of semantically consistent, compared with semantically inconsistent, objects. These results show that differences in N300/400 components related to scene-object consistency do not index changes in cortical object representations but rather reflect a generic marker of semantic violations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that facilitatory effects between objects and scenes are task-dependent rather than automatic.

Because of the complex structure of eye fluctuations and brain signals, we employed fractal theory and sample entropy to decode their correlation. Ten subjects looked at four different images with different complexities while we collected their eye fluctuations and EEG signals simultaneously. The results indicated that the variations of the complexity of eye fluctuations and EEG signals are strongly correlated ( r =-0.8043 in case of fractal dimension and r =-0.9740 in case of sample entropy), which reflects the correlation among the activations of the eyes and brain. This analysis can be conducted to examine how the activations of other organs are linked to brain activation. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

BCIs are based on artificial intelligence piloted systems. They collect brain activity patterns linked to the mental process and transform them into commands for actuators. The potential application of BCI systems is in the rehabilitation centres. In this context, a novel method is devised for automated identification of the Motor Imagery (MI) tasks. The contribution is an effective hybridization of the Multiscale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA), Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), statistical features extraction from subbands, and ensemble learning-based classifiers for categorization of the MI tasks. The intended electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are segmented and denoised. The denoising is achieved with a Daubechies algorithm-based wavelet transform (WT) incorporated in the MSPCA. The WT with the 5th level of decomposition is used. Onward, the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), with the 4th level of decomposition, is used for subbands formation. The statistical features are selected from each subband, namely, mean absolute value, average power, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Also, ratios of absolute mean values of adjacent subbands are computed and concatenated with other extracted features. Finally, the ensemble machine learning approach is used for the classification of MI tasks. The usefulness is evaluated by using the BCI competition III, MI dataset IVa. Results revealed that the suggested ensemble learning approach yields the highest classification accuracies of 98.69% and 94.83%, respectively, for the cases of subject-dependent and subject-independent problems.

Thus, the EEG can be represented in different domains. However, designing an EEG-based BCI system without any transformation technique is a challenge. For this purpose, in this study, a BCI model is proposed without any transformation. The classification of cursor down and cursor up movements using the EEG signals received from the brain is aimed at in the proposed model. The EEG patterns were classified using two methods. Firstly, EEG signals were classified by classic convolutional neural network (CNN). Secondly, proposed hybrid structure obtained the EEG features, which were classified by k-NN and SVM, using CNN. Classification with CNN architecture gave a result of 68.15% while the hybrid method using k-NN and SVM classifiers yielded 97.55% and 97.61% respectively. The hybrid proposed method were more successful than the studies in the literature.

Due to the human brain's complexity, the EEG pattern varies from different individuals, leading to low cross-subject classification performance. What is more, even within the same subject, EEG data also shows diversity for the same reason. Many researchers have conducted experiments to deal with the variance between subjects by transfer learning or domain adaptation. However, most of them are still low-performance, especially when the new subject does not share generality with samples. In this study, we examined using cross-phase data instead of cross-subject data because the discrepancy of different phase data should be smaller than that of different subjects. Different phases represent data recorded multiple times from the same subject with the same stimuli. Two neural networks are adopted to verify the effectiveness of the cross-phase domain adaptation. As a result, experiments on the public EEG dataset showed approximation level accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art method but much lower standard derivation. Moreover, multiple source domains promote accuracy in contrast to one single domain. This study helps develop a more robust and high-performance real-time EEG system by transferring knowledge from previous data phases.

Such mental responses stem from physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a noninvasive and nonradioactive solution for emotion identification. Accurate and automatic classification of emotions can boost the development of human-computer interface. This article proposes automatic extraction and classification of features through the use of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs). At first, the proposed method converts the filtered EEG signals into an image using a time-frequency representation. Smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution is used to transform time-domain EEG signals into images. These images are fed to pretrained AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 along with configurable CNN. The performance of four CNNs is evaluated by measuring the accuracy, precision, Mathew's correlation coefficient, F1-score, and false-positive rate. The results obtained by evaluating four CNNs show that configurable CNN requires very less learning parameters with better accuracy. Accuracy scores of 90.98%, 91.91%, 92.71%, and 93.01% obtained by AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, and configurable CNN show that the proposed method is best among other existing methods.

With the application of digital twin, product performance evaluation has entered the data-driven era. However, traditional methods for evaluation mainly place emphasis on structure analysis in the stage of manufacturing and service in digital twin. They cannot synthesize multi-source information and take the high-level emotional response into consideration in the design stage. To overcome these disadvantages, a digital twin-driven method is proposed evaluating product design schemes in this study. It enables the acquisition of electroencephalogram (EEG) data, physical data, and emotional feedback. Human factors are systematically considered in the evaluation process to establish the information association between EEG and performance levels. Moreover, intelligent psycho-physiological analysis that incorporates EEG into the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and machine learning methods is adopted within the proposed method. It synthesizes human factors such as psychological requirements, subjective and objective assessment indicators to realize a novel machine learning-based EEG analysis. Taking advantage of the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) improved Riemannian manifold mapping, Riemann geometry (RG) features are extracted and selected from EEG signals. Differences of implicit psychological states while using the product produced by different design schemes can be more easily detected and classified. A case study of high-speed elevator is conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The accuracy of EEG classification for performance evaluation reaches 92%.

Existing approaches usually require amassing extensive EEG data of each new subject, which is prohibitively time-consuming along with poor user experience. To tackle this issue, we divide EEG representations into private components specific to each subject and shared emotional components that are universal to all subjects. According to this representation partition, we propose a plug-and-play domain adaptation method for dealing with the inter-subject variability. In the training phase, subject-invariant emotional representations and private components of source subjects are separately captured by a shared encoder and private encoders. Furthermore, we build one emotion classifier on the shared partition and subjects' individual classifiers on the combination of these two partitions. In the calibration phase, the model only requires few unlabeled EEG data from incoming target subjects to model their private components. Therefore, besides the shared emotion classifier, we have another pipeline to use the knowledge of source subjects through the similarity of private components. In the test phase, we integrate predictions of the shared emotion classifier with those of individual classifiers ensemble after modulation by similarity weights. Experimental results on the SEED dataset show that our model greatly shortens the calibration time within a minute while maintaining the recognition accuracy, all of which make emotion decoding more generalizable and practicable.

Time series are used in many fields to understand the behavior of systems, to make predictions, to create solutions to problems, etc. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are frequently used in the diagnosis of diseases and research in this field. EEG signals examine the neural activity of the brain, while ECG examines the work of the heart muscle and neural conduction system. These signs contain a large amount of information about the functioning of the brain and heart functions. In order to use this information, experts in the field of signal processing must evaluate these signals. Due to the successful application methods of EEG and ECG signals in classification problems, various fields of artificial intelligence applications are frequently used by experts. In this study, a new hybrid model has been developed to classify EEG and ECG signals. These signals of five different classes have been used as the feature vector in the training of machine learning algorithms with 10 statistical parameters (8 normalized, 2 real signals). These algorithms are designed to give the best performance. In the proposed hybrid model, a machine learning model consisting of four stages is used. In the experimental studies, it has been observed that the proposed hybrid method gives better results than the normal classification process. The obtained results are given in the experimental studies section in detail.

Most of these algorithms are classified based on the ERP characteristics. To observe the characteristics of ERPs, an averaging method using electroencephalography (EEG) signals cut out by time-locking to the event for each condition is required. To date, several classification methods using only single-trial EEG signals have been studied. In some cases, the machine learning models were used for the classifications; however, the relationship between the constructed model and the characteristics of ERPs remains unclear. In this study, the LightGBM model was constructed for each individual to classify a single-trial waveform and visualize the relationship between these features and the characteristics of ERPs. The features used in the model were the average values and standard deviation of the EEG amplitude with a time width of 10 ms. The best area under the curve (AUC) score was 0.92, but, in some cases, the AUC scores were low. Large individual differences in AUC scores were observed. In each case, on checking the importance of the features, high importance was shown at the 10-ms time width section, where a large difference was observed in ERP waveforms between the target and the nontarget. Since the model constructed in this study was found to reflect the characteristics of ERP, as the next step, we would like to try to improve the discrimination performance by using stimuli that the participants can concentrate on with interest.

Previously, during the SeizeIT1 project, we studied seizure detection based on behind-the-ear electroencephalography (EEG). However, the obtained sensitivities were too low for practical use, because not all seizures are associated with typical ictal EEG patterns. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop a multimodal automated seizure detection algorithm integrating behind-the-ear EEG and electrocardiography (ECG) for detecting focal seizures. In this framework, we quantified the added value of ECG to behind-the-ear EEG. Methods This study analyzed three multicenter databases consisting of 135 patients having focal epilepsy and a total of 896 seizures. A patient-specific multimodal automated seizure detection algorithm was developed using behind-the-ear/temporal EEG and single-lead ECG. The EEG and ECG data were processed separately using machine learning methods. A late integration approach was applied for fusing those predictions. Results The multimodal algorithm outperformed the EEG-based algorithm in two of three databases, with an increase of 11% and 8% in sensitivity for the same false alarm rate. Significance ECG can be of added value to an EEG-based seizure detection algorithm using only behind-the-ear/temporal lobe electrodes for patients with focal epilepsy.

J	Dong, AM; Li, ZG; Zheng, QY				Dong, Aimei; Li, Zhigang; Zheng, Qiuyu			Transferred Subspace Learning Based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization for EEG Signal Classification	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						non-negative factorization; transfer learning; shared hidden subspace; EEG signal; classification	SEIZURE; FRAMEWORK; EPILEPSY; PARTS	EEG signal classification has been a research hotspot recently. The combination of EEG signal classification with machine learning technology is very popular. Traditional machine leaning methods for EEG signal classification assume that the EEG signals are drawn from the same distribution. However, the assumption is not always satisfied with the practical applications. In practical applications, the training dataset and the testing dataset are from different but related domains. How to make best use of the training dataset knowledge to improve the testing dataset is critical for these circumstances. In this paper, a novel method combining the non-negative matrix factorization technology and the transfer learning (NMF-TL) is proposed for EEG signal classification. Specifically, the shared subspace is extracted from the testing dataset and training dataset using non-negative matrix factorization firstly and then the shared subspace and the original feature space are combined to obtain the final EEG signal classification results. On the one hand, the non-negative matrix factorization can assure to obtain essential information between the testing and the training dataset; on the other hand, the combination of shared subspace and the original feature space can fully use all the signals including the testing and the training dataset. Extensive experiments on Bonn EEG confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Although convolutional neural networks have been gradually applied to MI classification task and gained high performance, the following problems still exist to make effective decoding of raw EEG signals challenging: 1) EEG signals are non-linear, non-stationary, and low signal-noise ratio. 2) Most existing end-to-end MI models utilize single scale convolution which limits the result of classification because the best convolution scale varies with different subject (called subject difference). In addition, even for the same subject, the best convolution scale also differs from time to time (called time difference). In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model, named Multi-branch Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (MMCNN), for motor imagery classification. The MMCNN model effectively decodes raw EEG signals without any pre-processing including filtering. Meanwhile, the multi-branch multi-scale convolution structure successfully addresses the problems of subject difference and time difference based on parallel processing. In addition, multi-scale convolution can realize the characterization of information in different frequency bands, thereby effectively solving the problem that the best convolution scale is difficult to determine. Experiments on two public BCI competition datasets demonstrate that the proposed MMCNN model outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

Currently, most methods for brainprint recognition are based on traditional machine learning and only focus on a single brain cognition task. Due to the ability to extract high-level features and latent dependencies, deep learning can effectively overcome the limitation of specific tasks, but numerous samples are required for model training. Therefore, brainprint recognition in realistic scenes with multiple individuals and small amounts of samples in each class is challenging for deep learning. This article proposes a Convolutional Tensor-Train Neural Network (CTNN) for the multi-task brainprint recognition with small number of training samples. Firstly, local temporal and spatial features of the brainprint are extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN) with depthwise separable convolution mechanism. Afterwards, we implement the TensorNet (TN) via low-rank representation to capture the multilinear intercorrelations, which integrates the local information into a global one with very limited parameters. The experimental results indicate that CTNN has high recognition accuracy over 99% on all four datasets, and it exploits brainprint under multi-task efficiently and scales well on training samples. Additionally, our method can also provide an interpretable biomarker, which shows specific seven channels are dominated for the recognition tasks.

J	Mussabayeva, A; Jamwal, PK; Akhtar, MT				Mussabayeva, Ayana; Jamwal, Prashant Kumar; Akhtar, Muhammad Tahir			Ensemble Voting-Based Multichannel EEG Classification in a Subject-Independent P300 Speller	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						brain-computer interface; EEG classification; ensemble learning; P300 speller	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; ALGORITHM; SIGNALS; SYSTEM	Classification of brain signal features is a crucial process for any brain-computer interface (BCI) device, including speller systems. The positive P300 component of visual event-related potentials (ERPs) used in BCI spellers has individual variations of amplitude and latency that further changse with brain abnormalities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This leads to the necessity for the users to train the speller themselves, which is a very time-consuming procedure. To achieve subject-independence in a P300 speller, ensemble classifiers are proposed based on classical machine learning models, such as the support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and the convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed voters were trained on healthy subjects' data using a generic training approach. Different combinations of electroencephalography (EEG) channels were used for the experiments presented, resulting in single-channel, four-channel, and eight-channel classification. ALS patients' data represented robust results, achieving more than 90% accuracy when using an ensemble of LDA, kNN, and SVM on four active EEG channels data in the occipital area of the brain. The results provided by the proposed ensemble voting models were on average about 5% more accurate than the results provided by the standalone classifiers. The proposed ensemble models could also outperform boosting algorithms in terms of computational complexity or accuracy. The proposed methodology shows the ability to be subject-independent, which means that the system trained on healthy subjects can be efficiently used for ALS patients. Applying this methodology for online speller systems removes the necessity to retrain the P300 speller.

Different emotions display different connectivity patterns through related information processing. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotional recognition is a controversial subject in the field of affective computing. However, EEG recordings are mixed-signals and cannot show the exact information about active sources from different emotional states. In this paper, we propose a method for emotion discrimination based on the source connectivity method. Features are extracted as connectivity patterns in different frequency bands based on emotion-based reconstructed EEG sources using sLORETA. In order to identify most related brain regions to emotions, we identify data-driven spatially compact regions, called regions of interest (ROIs), based on the reconstructed neural activity. Also, to estimates ROI time series with the intrinsic non-stationarity of neural activity, an iterative dynamic approach is used. The method explicitly contains a dynamic constraint, considering the neural activity evolution for advance connectivity analysis. Throughout this study, we consider three connectivity measures widely applied to emotion recordings including, iCoh, PLV, and WPLI. In the next step, the connectivity patterns are used as features to discriminate emotion states by training an SVM classifier. The performance of the proposed method is assessed over a real high-resolution emotional database. This study reveals that the proposed method can identify meaningful connection features between main emotion-related brain regions, leading to higher interpretability and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the ROI-wise iCoh features enhance the average of accuracy up to 83.84% in comparison with raw EEG features (71.70%).

Some solutions using electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been presented in the literature to solve this problem. However, few studies have aimed to determine which recording statuses and which channels are effective for the diagnosis of ADHD. In this study, the effects of photic stimuli at different frequencies and on different channels on ADHD diagnosis were analysed. The main purpose of this study is to reveal the most effective channel and the most effective recording status for ADHD diagnosis. In this way, EEG data can be obtained from effective channels and recording statuses, and ADHD classification can be performed with fewer channels and higher accuracy. This can reduce the amount of data to be processed and the numbers of recording procedures. The dataset used in the experiments of this study was obtained using power spectral densities and spectral entropy values. These values were obtained from individuals with and without ADHD. When these data were applied to long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network classifiers, the highest accuracy was obtained with LSTM. The accuracy of LSTM was calculated as 88.88% on the "Fp1,F7" channel and 92.15% in the eyes-closed resting state. Spectral entropy was found to contribute positively to the accuracy. As a result, the potential difference between "Fp1,F7" electrodes in the eyes-closed resting state proved to be effective in diagnosing ADHD.

This review focuses on the most relevant topics on brain-controlled vehicles, with a special reference to the terrestrial BCV (e.g., the mobile car, car simulator, real car, graphical and gaming car) and the aerial BCV, also called BCAV (e.g., real quadcopters, drones, fixed wings, graphical helicopter, and aircraft) controlled by using bio-signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrooculogram (EOG), and Electromyogram (EMG). For instance, EEG-based algorithms detect patterns from the motor imaginary cortex area of the brain for intention detection, patterns like event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization, steady-state visually evoked potentials, P300, and generated local evoked potential patterns. We have identified that the reported best-performing approaches employ machine learning and artificial intelligence optimization methods, namely support vector machine, neural network, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor, k-means, water drop optimization, and chaotic tug of war. We considered the following metrics to analyze the efficiency of the different methods: type and combination of bio-signals, time response, and accuracy values with statistical analysis. The present work provides an extensive literature review of the key findings of the past ten years, indicating future perspectives in the field.

One of the most popular approaches to BCI is motor imagery (MI). In BCI applications, the electroencephalography (EEG) is a very popular measurement for brain dynamics because of its noninvasive nature. Although there is a high interest in the BCI topic, the performance of existing systems is still far from ideal, due to the difficulty of performing pattern recognition tasks in EEG signals. This difficulty lies in the selection of the correct EEG channels, the signal-to-noise ratio of these signals, and how to discern the redundant information among them. BCI systems are composed of a wide range of components that perform signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and decision making. In this article, we define a new BCI framework, called enhanced fusion framework, where we propose three different ideas to improve the existing MI-based BCI frameworks. First, we include an additional preprocessing step of the signal: a differentiation of the EEG signal that makes it time invariant. Second, we add an additional frequency band as a feature for the system: the sensorimotor rhythm band, and we show its effect on the performance of the system. Finally, we make a profound study of how to make the final decision in the system. We propose the usage of both up to six types of different classifiers and a wide range of aggregation functions (including classical aggregations, Choquet and Sugeno integrals, and their extensions and overlap functions) to fuse the information given by the considered classifiers. We have tested this new system on a dataset of 20 volunteers performing MI-based brain-computer interface experiments. On this dataset, the new system achieved 88.80% accuracy. We also propose an optimized version of our system that is able to obtain up to 90.76%. Furthermore, we find that the pair Choquet/Sugeno integrals and overlap functions are the ones providing the best results.

In this study, we further investigated if this ability can be predicted by the individual brain's functional organization at rest. To this purpose, we recorded resting-state, high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) in healthy volunteers before performing the DTP task. This allowed us to obtain source-reconstructed cortical activity and compute whole-brain resting state functional connectivity at the source level. We then extracted phase locking values from the parceled cortex based on the Destrieux atlas to estimate individual functional connectivity at rest in the three task-related networks. Furthermore, we applied a machine-learning approach (i.e., support vector regression) and were able to predict both behavioral (response speed and accuracy adaptation) and neural (ERP modulation) task-dependent outcome. Finally, by exploiting graph theory nodal measures (i.e., degree, strength, local efficiency and clustering coefficient), we characterized the contribution of each node to the task-related neural and behavioral effects. These results show that the brain's intrinsic functional organization can be potentially used as a predictor of the system capability to adjust motor control in a flexible and implicit way. Additionally, our findings support the theoretical framework in which cognitive control is conceived as an emergent property rooted in bottom-up associative learning processes.

Rajendra			Detection of Parkinson's disease using automated tunable Q wavelet transform technique with EEG signals	BIOCYBERNETICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Parkinson's disease; Automated tunable Q wavelet transform; Classification	CLASSIFICATION; STATE	Deep brain simulations play an important role to study physiological and neuronal behavior during Parkinson's disease (PD). Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals may faithfully represent the changes that occur during PD in the brain. But manual analysis of EEG signals is tedious, and time consuming as these signals are complex, non-linear, and non-stationary nature. Therefore EEG signals are required to decompose into multiple subbands (SBs) to get detailed and representative information from it. Experimental selection of basis function for the decomposition may cause system degradation due to information loss and an increased number of misclassification. To address this, an automated tunable Q wavelet transform (A-TQWT) is proposed for automatic decomposition. A-TQWT extracts representative SBs for analysis and provides better reconstruction for the synthesis of EEG signals by automatically selecting the tuning parameters. Five features are extracted from the SBs and classified different machine learning techniques. EEG dataset of 16 healthy controls (HC) and 15 PD (ON and OFF medication) subjects obtained from "openneuro" is used to develop the automated model. We have aimed to develop an automated model that effectively classify HC subjects from PD patients with and without medication. The proposed method yielded an accuracy of 96.13% and 97.65% while the area under the curve of 97% and 98.56% for the classification of HC vs PD OFF medication and HC vs PD ON medication using least square support vector machine, respectively.

During the early stages of PD, these changes are very subtle and hence accurate diagnosis is challenging. Pathological and neurological experts assess the PD patients by examining their drawing, writing, walking, tremor, facial expressions, and speech. The manual analysis performed by specialists is time-consuming and prone to errors. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals represent changes in the brain activities, but it is difficult to manually analyze these signals due to their non-linear, non-stationary, and complex nature. Traditional machine learning methods require several manual steps, such as decomposition, extraction of features, and classification. To overcome these limitations, automated PD detection using smoothed pseudo-Wigner Ville distribution (SPWVD) coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNN) called Parkinson's disease CNN (PDCNNet) is proposed. First the EEG signals are subjected to SPWVD to obtain time-frequency representation (TFR). Then these two-dimensional plots are fed to an CNN. The proposed model is developed using two public databases. We have obtained an accuracy of 100% and 99.97% for dataset 1 and 2, respectively in detecting PD automatically using our proposed PDCNNet model. Our developed prototype has outperformed all existing state-of-the-art techniques and ready to be validated with more diverse datasets.

Machine Learning for personalised stress detection: Inter-individual variability of EEG-ECG markers for acute-stress response	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Machine Learning; EEG; ECG; Stress	PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Stress appears as a response for a broad variety of physiological stimuli. It does vary among individuals in amplitude, phase and frequency. Thus, the necessity for personalised diagnosis is key to prevent stress-related diseases. In order to evaluate stress levels, a multi-sensing system is proposed based on non-invasive EEG and ECG signals. A target population of 24 individuals which age range between 18-23 years old are intentionally exposed to control-induced stress tests while EEG and ECG are simultaneously recorded. The acquired signals are processed by using semisupevised Machine Learning techniques as those provide a patient-specific approach due to key characteristics such as adaptiveness and robustness. In here, a stress metric is proposed that jointly with each individual medical history provide mechanisms to prevent and avoid possible chronic-health issues for individuals whom are more sensitive to stressors. Finally, supervised learning techniques are used to classify the obtained featured clusters to evaluate specific and general subject models in order to pave the way for real time stress monitoring.

This paper strongly focusses on the simulations followed by implementation of the proposed cognitive states i.e. (i) EmotionOriented State (EOS) (ii) Thinking Oriented State (TOS) (iii) Memory Oriented State(MOS) (iv) Simple Regular Oriented State (SROS). A novel approach was implemented by creating different environmental contexts for different gaits in our lab. An experimental method was performed to isolate movement artifact using Independent Component Analysis from recorded EEG(Electroencephalogram) signals. Measurement of joint angles from joint positions captured using Kinect V2 sensors was done with the help of OpenSim software. The relationship between different gaits and mental states was established using Pearsons Correlation Coefficient, ANOVA(Analysis of variance) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier respectively. A strong relationship was found between them. The SVM classifier for the EOS and the non-EOS states based on joint angles inferred an accuracy of 81.08%. The ROC Curve for SVM classification depicted an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.9724.

Within the field of neuroscience, specifically in electrophysiological neuroimaging, researchers are starting to explore leveraging deep learning to make predictions on EEG data. Research remains open on the network architecture and the feature space that is most effective for EEG decoding. This paper compares deep learning using minimally processed EEG raw data versus deep learning using EEG spectral features using two different deep convolutional neural architectures. One of them from Putten et al. (2018) is tailored to process raw data; the other was derived from the VGG16 vision network (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015) which is designed to process EEG spectral features. We apply them to classify sex on 24-channel EEG from a large corpus of 1,574 participants. Not only do we improve on state-of-the-art classification performance for this type of classification problem, but we also show that in all cases, raw data classification leads to superior performance as compared to spectral EEG features. Interestingly we show that the neural network tailored to process EEG spectral features has increased performance when applied to raw data classification. Our approach suggests that the same convolutional networks used to process EEG spectral features yield superior performance when applied to EEG raw data.											8	0	0	6	6	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1557-170X	1558-4615	978-1-7281-1179-7	IEEE ENG MED BIO			2021							1039	1042		10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630708			4	Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BS7HB	34891466	Green Submitted, Bronze			2022-08-02	WOS:000760910501017

Neural tracking to go: auditory attention decoding and saliency detection with mobile EEG	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						mobile EEG; saliency; P3; speech envelope tracking; selective auditory attention; auditory attention decoding (AAD)	SPEECH	Objective. Neuro-steered assistive technologies have been suggested to offer a major advancement in future devices like neuro-steered hearing aids. Auditory attention decoding (AAD) methods would in that case allow for identification of an attended speaker within complex auditory environments, exclusively from neural data. Decoding the attended speaker using neural information has so far only been done in controlled laboratory settings. Yet, it is known that ever-present factors like distraction and movement are reflected in the neural signal parameters related to attention. Approach. Thus, in the current study we applied a two-competing speaker paradigm to investigate performance of a commonly applied electroencephalography-based AAD model outside of the laboratory during leisure walking and distraction. Unique environmental sounds were added to the auditory scene and served as distractor events. Main results. The current study shows, for the first time, that the attended speaker can be accurately decoded during natural movement. At a temporal resolution of as short as 5 s and without artifact attenuation, decoding was found to be significantly above chance level. Further, as hypothesized, we found a decrease in attention to the to-be-attended and the to-be-ignored speech stream after the occurrence of a salient event. Additionally, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict neural correlates of distraction with a computational model of auditory saliency based on acoustic features. Significance. Taken together, our study shows that auditory attention tracking outside of the laboratory in ecologically valid conditions is feasible and a step towards the development of future neural-steered hearing aids.

J	Biswas, S; Sinha, R				Biswas, Sukanya; Sinha, Rohit			Wavelet filterbank-based EEG rhythm-specific spatial features for covert speech classification	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							IMAGERY; DIAGONALIZATION; PERCEPTION; ALGORITHM; REMOVAL	The derivation of rhythm-specific spatial patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals for covert speech EEG classification task is dealt in this work. This study has been performed on a publicly accessible multi-channel covert speech EEG database consisting of multi-syllabic words. With the motivation of deriving more discriminative features, each channel data has been decomposed into distinct bands focussing on the five basic EEG rhythms using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based signal decomposition algorithm. Following that, for each band, the multi-class common spatial pattern (CSP) features are computed using joint approximate diagonalisation. The final feature vector is formed by retaining a few significant CSP components from all five bands. Radial basis function kernel-based support vector machines are used for covert speech classification. After 5-fold cross-validation, the proposed DWT-based bandwise-CSP features are noted to yield an average classification accuracy of 94%. In contrast with the existing (non-decomposed) CSP feature, a relative improvement of about 24% is achieved. For generalisation purposes, the proposed approach has also been evaluated for another covert speech database comprising more classes and subjects. The study highlights the discovery of more discriminative patterns with rhythm-specific processing in the context of covert speech classification. The proposed approach has the potential to be useful in other brain-computer interface paradigms that employ EEG signals.

Firstly, Bonn and Freiburg datasets were used to perform experiments. The Bonn dataset consists of binary and multi-class classification problems, and the Freiburg dataset consists of two-class EEG classification problems. In the preprocessing step, all datasets were prepossessed using a Butterworth band pass filter with 0.5-60 Hz cut-off frequency. Then, the EEG signals of the datasets were segmented into different time windows. In this section, dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) was used to decompose the EEG signals into the different sub-bands. In the following section, in order to feature extraction, various FD techniques were used, including Higuchi (HFD), Katz (KFD), Petrosian (PFD), Hurst exponent (HE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), Sevcik, box counting (BC), multiresolution box-counting (MBC), Margaos-Sun (MSFD), multifractal DFA (MF-DFA), and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). In the next step, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) technique was used for feature selection. Finally, the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional autoencoder (CNN-AE) were used for the classification step. In the classification step, the K-fold cross-validation with k = 10 was employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the classifier methods. The experiment results show that the proposed CNN-AE method achieved an accuracy of 99.736% and 99.176% for the Bonn and Freiburg datasets, respectively.

Due to the outstanding applications of emotion recognition, e.g., person-based decision making, mind-machine interfacing, cognitive interaction, affect detection, feeling detection, etc., emotion recognition has become successful in attracting the recent hype of AI-empowered research. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted driven by a range of approaches, which demand a systematic review of methodologies used for this task with their feature sets and techniques. It will facilitate the beginners as guidance towards composing an effective emotion recognition system. In this article, we have conducted a rigorous review on the state-of-the-art emotion recognition systems, published in recent literature, and summarized some of the common emotion recognition steps with relevant definitions, theories, and analyses to provide key knowledge to develop a proper framework. Moreover, studies included here were dichotomized based on two categories: i) deep learning-based, and ii) shallow machine learning-based emotion recognition systems. The reviewed systems were compared based on methods, classifier, the number of classified emotions, accuracy, and dataset used. An informative comparison, recent research trends, and some recommendations are also provided for future research directions.	[Islam, Md.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a key tool for non-invasive recording of brain activity and the diagnosis of epilepsy. EEG monitoring is also widely employed in rodent models to track epilepsy development and evaluate experimental therapies and interventions. Whereas automated seizure detection algorithms have been developed for clinical EEG, preclinical versions face challenges of inter-model differences and lack of EEG standardization, leaving researchers relying on time-consuming visual annotation of signals. Approach. In this study, a machine learning-based seizure detection approach, 'Epi-AI', which can semi-automate EEG analysis in multiple mouse models of epilepsy was developed. Twenty-six mice with a total EEG recording duration of 6451 h were used to develop and test the Epi-AI approach. EEG recordings were obtained from two mouse models of kainic acid-induced epilepsy (Models I and III), a genetic model of Dravet syndrome (Model II) and a pilocarpine mouse model of epilepsy (Model IV). The Epi-AI algorithm was compared against two threshold-based approaches for seizure detection, a local Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) approach and a global Teager-Kaiser energy operator-discrete wavelet transform (TKEO-DWT) combination approach. Main results. Epi-AI demonstrated a superior sensitivity, 91.4%-98.8%, and specificity, 93.1%-98.8%, in Models I-III, to both of the threshold-based approaches which performed well on individual mouse models but did not generalise well across models. The performance of the TKEO approach in Models I-III ranged from 66.9%-91.3% sensitivity and 60.8%-97.5% specificity to detect spontaneous seizures when compared with expert annotations. The sensitivity and specificity of the TKEO-DWT approach were marginally better than the TKEO approach in Models I-III at 73.2%-80.1% and 75.8%-98.1%, respectively. When tested on EEG from Model IV which was not used in developing the Epi-AI approach, Epi-AI was able to identify seizures with 76.3% sensitivity and 98.1% specificity. Significance. Epi-AI has the potential to provide fast, objective and reproducible semi-automated analysis of multiple types of seizure in long-duration EEG recordings in rodents.

More fatal accidents could be avoided if fatigued drivers were warned ahead of time. Several drowsiness detection technologies to monitor for signs of inattention while driving and notifying the driver can be adopted. Sensors in self-driving cars must detect if a driver is sleepy, angry, or experiencing extreme changes in their emotions, such as anger. These sensors must constantly monitor the driver's facial expressions and detect facial landmarks in order to extract the driver's state of expression presentation and determine whether they are driving safely. As soon as the system detects such changes, it takes control of the vehicle, immediately slows it down, and alerts the driver by sounding an alarm to make them aware of the situation. The proposed system will be integrated with the vehicle's electronics, tracking the vehicle's statistics and providing more accurate results. In this paper, we have implemented real-time image segmentation and drowsiness using machine learning methodologies. In the proposed work, an emotion detection method based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) has been implemented using facial expressions. The algorithm was tested under variable luminance conditions and outperformed current research in terms of accuracy. We have achieved 83.25 % to detect the facial expression change.

The previously-reported behavioral benefits of physical exercise on mental fatigue recovery prompted us to investigate the restorative effect and reveal the underlying neural mechanisms. Specifically, we introduced an empirical method to investigate the beneficial effect of physical exercise on the reorganization of EEG functional connectivity (FC) in a two-session experiment where one session including a successive 30-min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) (No-intervention session) compared to an insertion of a mid-task 15-min cycling exercise (Intervention session). EEG FC was obtained from 21 participants and quantitatively assessed via graph theoretical analysis and a classification framework. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of exercise intervention on behavioral performance as shown in improved reaction time and response accuracy. Although we found significantly altered network alterations towards the end of experiment in both sessions, no significant differences between the two sessions and no interaction between session and time were found in EEG network topology. Further interrogation of functional connectivity through classification analysis showed decreased FC in distributed brain areas, which may lead to the significant reduction of network efficiency in both sessions. Moreover, we showed distinct patterns of FC alterations between the two sessions, indicating different information processing strategies adopted in the intervention session. In sum, these results provide some of the first quantitative insights into the complex neural mechanism of exercise intervention for fatigue recovery and lead a new direction for further application research in real-world situations.

J	Lilja, L; Joelsson, S; Nilsson, J; Lindgren, S; Rylander, C				Lilja, Linus; Joelsson, Sara; Nilsson, Josefin; Lindgren, Sophie; Rylander, Christian			Application of a standardized EEG pattern classification in the assessment of neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest: A retrospective analysis	RESUSCITATION			English	Article						EEG pattern; Comatose; Cardiac arrest; Neurological prognosis	RESUSCITATION COUNCIL GUIDELINES; NEUROPHYSIOLOGY; SOCIETY	Introduction: Electroencephalogram (EEG) is used in the neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest. "Highly malignant" EEG patterns classified according to Westhall have a high specificity for poor neurological outcome when applied within protocols of recent studies. However, their predictive performance when applied in everyday clinical practice has not been investigated. We studied the prognostic accuracy and the interrater agreement when standardized EEG patterns were analysed and compared to neurological outcome in a patient cohort at a tertiary centre not involved in the original study of the standardized EEG pattern classification. Methods: Comatose patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were included. Poor outcome was defined as Cerebral Performance Category 3 -5. Two senior consultants and one resident in clinical neurophysiology, blinded to clinical data and outcome, independently reviewed their EEG registrations and categorised the pattern as "highly malignant", "malignant" or "benign". These categories were compared to neurological outcome at hospital discharge. Interrater agreement was assessed using Cohen's Kappa. Results: In total, 62 patients were included. The median (IQR) time to EEG was 59 (42-91) h after return of spontaneous circulation. Poor outcome was found in 52 (84%) patients. In 21 patients at least one of the raters considered the EEG to contain a "highly malignant" pattern, all with poor outcome (42% sensitivity, 100% specificity). The interrater agreement varied from kappa 0.62 to 0.29. Conclusion: "Highly malignant" patterns predict poor neurological outcome with a high specificity in everyday practice. However, interrater agreement may vary substantially even between experienced EEG interpreters.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to establish communication paths between the brain processes and external devices. Different methods have been used to extract human intentions from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Those based on motor imagery (MI) seem to have a great potential for future applications. These approaches rely on the extraction of EEG distinctive patterns during imagined movements. Techniques able to extract patterns from raw signals represent an important target for BCI as they do not need labor-intensive data pre-processing. Approach. We propose a new approach based on a 10-layer one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) to classify five brain states (four MI classes plus a 'baseline' class) using a data augmentation algorithm and a limited number of EEG channels. In addition, we present a transfer learning method used to extract critical features from the EEG group dataset and then to customize the model to the single individual by training its late layers with only 12-min individual-related data. Main results. The model tested with the 'EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset' outperforms the current state-of-the-art models by achieving a 99.38% <i accuracy at the group level. In addition, the transfer learning approach we present achieves an average accuracy of 99.46% Significance. The proposed methods could foster the development of future BCI applications relying on few-channel portable recording devices and individual-based training.

Environmental factors that trigger stress are called stressors. In case of prolonged exposure to multiple stressors impacting simultaneously, a person's mental and physical health can be adversely affected which can further lead to chronic health issues. To prevent stress-related issues, it is necessary to detect them in the nascent stages which are possible only by continuous monitoring of stress. Wearable devices promise real-time and continuous data collection, which helps in personal stress monitoring. In this paper, a comprehensive review has been presented, which focuses on stress detection using wearable sensors and applied machine learning techniques. This paper investigates the stress detection approaches adopted in accordance with the sensory devices such as wearable sensors, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Photoplethysmography (PPG), and also depending on various environments like during driving, studying, and working. The stressors, techniques, results, advantages, limitations, and issues for each study are highlighted and expected to provide a path for future research studies. Also, a multimodal stress detection system using a wearable sensor-based deep learning technique has been proposed at the end.

In analysis of EEG data, achieving a higher classification performance is dependent on the appropriate representation of EEG features which is mostly characterized by one unique frequency before applying a learning model. Neglecting other frequencies of EEG signals could deteriorate the recognition performance of the model because each frequency has its unique advantages. Motivated by this idea, we propose to obtain distinguishable features with different frequencies by introducing an integrated deep learning model to accurately classify multiple classes of upper limb movement intentions. Methods: The proposed model is a combination of long short-term memory (LSTM) and stacked autoencoder (SAE). To validate the method, four high-level amputees were recruited to perform five motor intention tasks. The acquired EEG signals were first preprocessed before exploring the consequence of input representation on the performance of LSTM-SAE by feeding four frequency bands related to the tasks into the model. The learning model was further improved by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to eliminate feature redundancy, and to enhance the motor intention recognition. Results: The experimental results of the classification performance showed that the proposed model achieves an average performance of 99.01% for accuracy, 99.10% for precision, 99.09% for recall, 99.09% for f1_score, 99.77% for specificity, and 99.0% for Cohen's kappa, across multi-subject and multi-class scenarios. Further evaluation with 2-dimensional t-SNE revealed that the signal decomposition has a distinct multi-class separability in the feature space. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the predominance of the proposed model in its ability to accurately classify upper limb movements from multiple classes of EEG signals, and its potential application in the development of a more intuitive and naturalistic prosthetic control.

EEG-Based Tool for Prediction of University Students' Cognitive Performance in the Classroom	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						EEG; cognitive performance; education; neuroengineering; machine learning	SUSTAINED ATTENTION; BRAIN; CREATIVITY; NETWORK	This study presents a neuroengineering-based machine learning tool developed to predict students' performance under different learning modalities. Neuroengineering tools are used to predict the learning performance obtained through two different modalities: text and video. Electroencephalographic signals were recorded in the two groups during learning tasks, and performance was evaluated with tests. The results show the video group obtained a better performance than the text group. A correlation analysis was implemented to find the most relevant features to predict students' performance, and to design the machine learning tool. This analysis showed a negative correlation between students' performance and the (theta/alpha) ratio, and delta power, which are indicative of mental fatigue and drowsiness, respectively. These results indicate that users in a non-fatigued and well-rested state performed better during learning tasks. The designed tool obtained 85% precision at predicting learning performance, as well as correctly identifying the video group as the most efficient modality.

EEG signals are recorded as sinusoidal waves, containing spectral amplitudes across several frequency bands with high spatio-temporal resolution. Prior work on EEG signal analysis has been made mainly at individual electrodes. These signals can be evaluated from advanced aspects, including sub-regional and hemispheric analyses. Due to limitation of computational techniques, few studies in earlier work could conduct data analyses from these aspects. Therefore, EEG in patients with SUD is not fully understood. In the present retrospective study, spectral powers from a data house containing opioid (OUD), methamphetamine/stimulants (MUD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) were extracted, and then converted into five distinct topographic data (i.e., electrode-based, cortical subregion-based, left-right hemispheric, anterior-posterior based, and total cortex-based analyses). We found that data conversion and reorganization in the topographic way had an impact on EEG spectral powers in patients with OUD significantly different from those with MUD or AUD. Differential changes were observed from multiple perspectives, including individual electrodes, subregions, hemispheres, anterior-posterior cortices, and across the cortex as a whole. Understanding the differential changes in EEG signals may be useful for future work with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), not only for diagnostic but also for prognostic purposes in patients with SUD.

Although different monitoring systems estimating antinociception effect during general anesthesia are available, the performance of these indices is limited. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of the probability of movement if a standardized tetanic stimulation is applied to the patient, using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal as input. Seventy-seven female patients, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgical procedures under general anesthesia, were included. EEG segments of 45s, preceding tetanic stimulation, were split into epochs of 5s with no overlapping. Features from both time and frequency domain, including continuous wavelet transform (CWT), were considered. Five different machine learning (ML) models were tested: 1D CNN model for raw EEG signal, random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier and support vector classifier for extracted features and finally 2D CNN model for CWT scalogram. The results showed that the performance of the proposed ML models to predict movement to standardized tetanic stimulation through the EEG signal was almost equal to the performance of commercially available indices (AUC=0.73). This performance was improved (AUC=0.84) with ML methods in ensemble mode with pupil diameter and remifentanil effect site concentration. Indeed, prediction of movement to noxious stimulation through the EEG signal matches state of the art and could potentially be used in combination of other variables.

In this study, we evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of an automated clustering method to accelerate expert annotation of cEEG. New method: We learned a local dictionary from 97 ICU patients by applying k-medoids clustering to 592 features in the time and frequency domains. We utilized changepoint detection (CPD) to segment the cEEG recordings. We then computed a bag-of-words (BoW) representation for each segment. We further clustered the segments by affinity propagation. EEG experts scored the resulting clusters for each patient by labeling only the cluster medoids. We trained a random forest classifier to assess validity of the clusters. Results: Mean pairwise agreement of 62.6% using this automated method was not significantly different from interrater agreements using manual labeling (63.8%), demonstrating the validity of the method. We also found that it takes experts using our method 5.31 +/- 4.44 min to label the 30.19 +/- 3.84 h of cEEG data, more than 45 times faster than unaided manual review, demonstrating efficiency. Comparison with existing methods: Previous studies of EEG data labeling have generally yielded similar human expert interrater agreements, and lower agreements with automated methods. Conclusions: Our results suggest that long EEG recordings can be rapidly annotated by experts many times faster than unaided manual review through the use of an advanced clustering method.

In particular, Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) reflect an increased likelihood of seizures and are routinely assessed by visual analysis of the EEG. Visual assessment is, however, time consuming and prone to subjectivity, leading to a high misdiagnosis rate and motivating the development of automated approaches. Research towards automating IED detection started 45 years ago. Approaches range from mimetic methods to deep learning techniques. We review different approaches to IED detection, dis-cussing their performance and limitations. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods have yielded the best results so far and their application in the field is still growing. Standardization of datasets and outcome measures is necessary to compare models more objectively and decide which should be implemented in a clinical setting.

J	Woodbright, M; Verma, B; Haidar, A				Woodbright, Mitchell; Verma, Brijesh; Haidar, Ali			Autonomous deep feature extraction based method for epileptic EEG brain seizure classification	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Convolutional neural networks; Feature extraction; Epilepsy; Deep learning; EEG signal	FUNCTION NEURAL-NETWORK	Epilepsy is a highly prevalent disorder that can affect a person's quality of life. People with epilepsy are commonly affected by reoccurring seizures that potentially cause injury or death. Neurologists frequently use Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to diagnose people with epilepsy. However, this can be both laborious and error-prone, as this can rely on competency and insight from undertrained neurologists. Machine learning-based methods have been recently proposed for seizure detection so that neurologists can make a quick and correct diagnosis. However, these methods often require features of the EEG signal to be extracted from data before the data can be used. Furthermore, the choice of features often requires domain knowledge about the data, and depending on the expert knowledge of the user, the selection of which features to extract can have a dramatic impact on the classifier's performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can autonomously extract features from deep within a convolutional neural network (CNN) and generate easy to understand rules/explanations used for the classification of seizures from EEG signals. The aim of creating rules/explanations is to explain the internal logic of our method to give the neurologist insight into the decision-making process. Thus, distilling trust. We evaluate our method against other classifiers in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and achieve an accuracy of 98.65%, sensitivity of 96.29%, specificity of 99.25%.

The effectiveness of CSP is determined by the quality of interception in a specific time window and frequency band. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize CSP by splitting the EEG data with a sliding time window and dividing the frequency bands with a set of band-pass filters, simultaneously. However, they did not consider the drawbacks of the rapid increase in data volume and feature dimensions brought about by this method, which would reduce the classification accuracy and calculation efficiency of the model. Therefore, we propose an optimal channel-based sparse time-frequency blocks common spatial pattern (OCSB-CSP) feature extraction method to improve the model classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on two public EEG datasets show that the proposed method can quickly select significant time-frequency blocks and improve classification performance. The average classification accuracies are higher than those of other winners' methods, providing a new idea for the improvement of BCI applications.

Inter-subject classification performance is assessed on EEG recorded from fourteen long-term Rajayoga meditators. Common spatial pattern is used for feature extraction, and linear discriminant analysis is used for dimensionality reduction. The sequence of features thus obtained is fed to a LSTM based DNN, which employs a fully connected layer for classification. We have achieved inter-subject classification accuracies of 79.1%, 86.5%, 91.0%, and 94.1% with the respective use of the alpha, beta, lower-gamma, and higher-gamma bands for classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ deep learning to distinguish between the brain's electrical activity during meditation and at rest.

Since each and every function is controlled by our brain, the study of EEG makes sense for the analysis of sleep issues. In sleep, everyone go past at max of six stages. Sleep stage classification (SSC) is the golden technique for evaluation of human sleep. The objective of this undertaking is to classify the sleep stages as a way to allow/help physicians to come across the sleep issues. We consider only the single EEG instead of multiple/multi-channel signals consider by the earlier works. Hence we name our method as single channel-SSC (SC-SSC). In this approach, we consider time domain as well as frequency domain features and the experimental machine learning classification - support vector machine (SVM) which results better performs to earlier methods.

Different people have different latency and amplitude of the P300 event-related potential (ERP) component, which is used as the main feature for detecting the target character. In order to achieve robust results for different subjects using generic training (GT), the ensemble learning classifiers are proposed based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed models are trained using data from healthy subjects and tested on both healthy subjects and ALS patients. The results show that the fusion of LDA, kNN and SVM provides the most accurate results, achieving the accuracy of 99% for healthy subjects and about 85% for ALS patients.

Effective epileptic seizure prediction in sleep can assist doctors (patients) in administering (receiving) effective treatments to reduce the abovementioned probability. Most existing prediction methods do not consider electroencephalogram (EEG) features during sleep, leading to low accuracies in predicting seizures during sleep. Furthermore, traditional machine-learning based approaches might be susceptible to a high false alarm rate. In this paper, a novel patient-specific method based on deep learning and sleep scalp EEG is proposed to predict epileptic seizures. Raw EEG data are preprocessed to remove noise and reduce the complexity. Wavelet energy is used to reveal the features of the EEG signals in the time-frequency domain as the input of the classification phase. Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks are applied to excavate the most discriminative features to obtain classification results combined with leave-one-out cross-validation method. Subsequently, a two-step post-processing process optimises the prediction results. Based on four patients reasonably selected from the CHB-MIT scalp database, our experiments with various frequency band constraints demonstrate that the delta and gamma-band signals are important factors affecting seizure prediction performance. The classification performance of Bi-LSTM in our method with an accuracy of 99.47%, a sensitivity of 99.34%, and a specificity of 99.60%, is higher than that achieved with other neural networks. Additionally, compared with the existing methods for seizure prediction during sleep, the proposed method has a better prediction performance.

The brain controls our eyes' activities through the nervous system. Hence, analyzing the correlation between the activities of the eyes and brain is an important area of research in vision science. This paper evaluates the coupling between the reactions of the eyes and the brain in response to different moving visual stimuli. Since both eye movements and EEG signals (as the indicator of brain activity) contain information, we employed Shannon entropy to decode the coupling between them. Ten subjects looked at four moving objects (dynamic visual stimuli) with different information contents while we recorded their EEG signals and eye movements. The results demonstrated that the changes in the information contents of eye movements and EEG signals are strongly correlated (r = 0.7084), which indicates a strong correlation between brain and eye activities. This analysis could be extended to evaluate the correlation between the activities of other organs versus the brain.

Presently, the features of brain functional diseases can be obtained with EEG analysis, but the relationship between characteristics of EEG and Alzheimer's disease has not been clearly clarified. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain variables (latent factors) across subjects in disease processes, decoding latent factor from brain activity contributes to the study of cognitive impairment. To that end, this work proposes to extract characteristics of Alzheimer's disease by combing latent factors of EEG with variational auto-encoder to realize disease identification. Primarily, power spectrum characteristics is investigated and it is found that the dominant frequency of two groups is different. Further analysis reveals that latent factor distribution of Alzheimer's disease exists obvious differences with normal group in the theta frequency band. Moreover, the latent factors are projected onto the three-dimensional state space and the transient rotation of neural state is found, which shows the dynamic characteristics of latent factors. In addition, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang classifier is adopted and multiple latent factors are fed into Takagi-Sugeno-Kang classifier for decoding. Compared with linear classifier, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy classifier has better performance in classification of energy feature from sub-frequency bands of latent factors. The accuracy of identification could up to 98.10% when the combination of energy features of four frequency bands is used as model input. Collectively, this work provides a feasible tool for identification of neurological dysfunction from the view of latent factors, especially contributing to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Methods: Twenty-three individuals with TLE were examined. We dichotomized clinical outcome into seizure-free (SF) and non-seizure-free (NSF) after two years of LEV. EEG effective power in different frequency bands was compared using baseline EEG (T0) and the EEG after three months of LEV therapy (T1) between SF and NSF patients. Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis was used to test and validate the prediction of the model for clinical outcome. Results: A total of 152 features were extracted from the EEG recordings. When considering only the features calculated at T1, a predictive power for seizure-freedom (AUC = 0.750) was obtained. When employing both T0 and T1 features, an AUC = 0.800 was obtained. Conclusions: This study provides a proof-of-concept pipeline for predicting the clinical response to anti-seizure medications in people with epilepsy. Significance: Future studies may benefit from the pipeline proposed in this study in order to develop a model that can match each patient to the most effective anti-seizure medication.

Deep Cellular Recurrent Network for Efficient Analysis of Time-Series Data With Spatial Information	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						Computer architecture; Microprocessors; Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Brain modeling; Logic gates; Cellular neural networks; Cellular neural networks; deep recurrent learning; electroencephalogram (EEG); long short-term memory (LSTM); machine fault analysis; seizure detection	EPILEPTIC SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION	Efficient processing of large-scale time-series data is an intricate problem in machine learning. Conventional sensor signal processing pipelines with hand-engineered feature extraction often involve huge computational costs with high dimensional data. Deep recurrent neural networks have shown promise in automated feature learning for improved time-series processing. However, generic deep recurrent models grow in scale and depth with the increased complexity of the data. This is particularly challenging in presence of high dimensional data with temporal and spatial characteristics. Consequently, this work proposes a novel deep cellular recurrent neural network (DCRNN) architecture to efficiently process complex multidimensional time-series data with spatial information. The cellular recurrent architecture in the proposed model allows for location-aware synchronous processing of time-series data from spatially distributed sensor signal sources. Extensive trainable parameter sharing due to cellularity in the proposed architecture ensures efficiency in the use of recurrent processing units with high-dimensional inputs. This study also investigates the versatility of the proposed DCRNN model for the classification of multiclass time-series data from different application domains. Consequently, the proposed DCRNN architecture is evaluated using two time-series data sets: a multichannel scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data set for seizure detection, and a machine fault detection data set obtained in-house. The results suggest that the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance while utilizing substantially less trainable parameters when compared to comparable methods in the literature.

In this regard, many studies have focused on using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and machine learning techniques to diagnose MDD. New method: This paper proposes a machine learning framework for MDD diagnosis, which uses different types of EEG-derived features. The features are extracted using statistical, spectral, wavelet, functional connectivity, and nonlinear analysis methods. The sequential backward feature selection (SBFS) algorithm is also employed to perform feature selection. Various classifier models are utilized to select the best one for the proposed framework. Results: The proposed method is validated with a public EEG dataset, including the EEG data of 34 MDD patients and 30 healthy subjects. The evaluation of the proposed framework is conducted using 10-fold cross-validation, providing the metrics such as accuracy (AC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), F1-score (F1), and false discovery rate (FDR). The best performance of the proposed method has provided an average AC of 99%, SE of 98.4%, SP of 99.6%, F1 of 98.9%, and FDR of 0.4% using the support vector machine with RBF kernel (RBFSVM) classifier. Comparison with existing methods: The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other approaches for MDD classification based on EEG signals. Conclusions: According to the obtained results, a highly accurate MDD diagnosis would be provided using the proposed method, while it can be utilized to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool for clinical purposes.

In order to probe it, we design an experiment to gather EEG data from mental arithmetic task under different difficulty levels. We construct brain complex networks using a complex network method and information entropy theory. We then employ weighted clustering coefficient to characterize the networks generated from different brain cognitive states. The results show that with the increase in task difficulty level, the mean weighted clustering coefficients show a decrease. This is due to the lack of coordination of brain activity and the low efficiency of the network organization caused by the increase in task difficulty. In addition, we calculate the permutation entropy from the signals of each channel EEG signals to support the findings from our network analysis. These findings render our method particularly useful for depicting the relationship between brain cognitive state and difficulty level.

Classification of visual comprehension based on EEG data using sparse optimal scoring	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						discriminant analysis; classification; optimal scoring; EEG; sign language	LANGUAGE; BRAIN; REGULARIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; STATE; THETA	Objective. Understanding and differentiating brain states is an important task in the field of cognitive neuroscience with applications in health diagnostics, such as detecting neurotypical development vs. autism spectrum or coma/vegetative state vs. locked-in state. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is a particularly useful tool for this task as EEG data can detect millisecond-level changes in brain activity across a range of frequencies in a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive fashion. The goal of this study is to apply machine learning methods to EEG data in order to classify visual language comprehension across multiple participants. Approach. 26-channel EEG was recorded for 24 Deaf participants while they watched videos of sign language sentences played in time-direct and time-reverse formats to simulate interpretable vs. uninterpretable sign language, respectively. Sparse optimal scoring (SOS) was applied to EEG data in order to classify which type of video a participant was watching, time-direct or time-reversed. The use of SOS also served to reduce the dimensionality of the features to improve model interpretability. Main results. The analysis of frequency-domain EEG data resulted in an average out-of-sample classification accuracy of 98.89%, which was far superior to the time-domain analysis. This high classification accuracy suggests this model can accurately identify common neural responses to visual linguistic stimuli. Significance. The significance of this work is in determining necessary and sufficient neural features for classifying the high-level neural process of visual language comprehension across multiple participants.

The unpredictability causes anxiety and much of the morbidity and mortality of seizures. In this work, 102 seizures of mesial temporal lobe onset were analyzed from 19 patients with DRE who had simultaneous intracranial EEG (iEEG) and scalp EEG as part of their surgical evaluation. The first aim of this paper was to develop machine learning models for seizure prediction and detection (i) using iEEG only, (ii) scalp EEG only and (iii) jointly analyzing both iEEG and scalp EEG. The second goal was to test if machine learning could detect a seizure on scalp EEG when that seizure was not detectable by the human eye (surface negative) but was seen in iEEG. The final question was to determine if the deep learning algorithm could correctly lateralize the seizure onset. The seizure detection and prediction problems were addressed jointly by training Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on 4 classes: non-seizure, pre-seizure, left mesial temporal onset seizure and right mesial temporal onset seizure. To address these aims, the classification accuracy was tested using two deep neural networks (DNN) against 3 different types of similarity graphs which used different time series of EEG data. The convolutional neural network (CNN) with the Waxman similarity graph yielded the highest accuracy across all EEG data (iEEG, scalp EEG and combined). Specifically, 1 second epochs of EEG were correctly assigned to their seizure, pre-seizure, or non-seizure category over 98% of the time. Importantly, the pre-seizure state was classified correctly in the vast majority of epochs (>97%). Detection from scalp EEG data alone of surface negative seizures and the seizures with the delayed scalp onset (the surface negative portion) was over 97%. In addition, the model accurately lateralized all of the seizures from scalp data, including the surface negative seizures. This work suggests that highly accurate seizure prediction and detection is feasible using either intracranial or scalp EEG data. Furthermore, surface negative seizures can be accurately predicted, detected and lateralized with machine learning even when they are not visible to the human eye.

In this study, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals were processed in real time using a 32 dry-electrode system during a sustained visual attention task. An attention training paradigm was implemented, as designed in DeBettencourt, Cohen, Lee, Norman, and Turk-Browne (2015) in which the composition of a sequence of blended images is updated based on the participant's decoded attentional level to a primed image category. It was hypothesized that a single neurofeedback training session would improve sustained attention abilities. Twenty-two participants were trained on a single neurofeedback session with behavioral pretraining and posttraining sessions within three consecutive days. Half of the participants functioned as controls in a double-blinded design and received sham neurofeedback. During the neurofeedback session, attentional states to primed categories were decoded in real time and used to provide a continuous feedback signal customized to each participant in a closed-loop approach. We report a mean classifier decoding error rate of 34.3% (chance=50%). Within the neurofeedback group, there was a greater level of taskrelevant attentional information decoded in the participant's brain before making a correct behavioral response than before an incorrect response. This effect was not visible in the control group (interaction p = 7.23e-4), which strongly indicates that we were able to achieve a meaningful measure of subjective attentional state in real time and control participants' behavior during the neurofeedback session. We do not provide conclusive evidence whether the single neurofeedback session per se provided lasting effects in sustained attention abilities. We developed a portable EEG neurofeedback system capable of decoding attentional states and predicting behavioral choices in the attention task at hand. The neurofeedback code framework is Python based and open source, and it allows users to actively engage in the development of neurofeedback tools for scientific and translational use.

The effective tool utilized in the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy is the Electroencephalogram (EEG). The emergence of machine learning promotes the development of automated epilepsy detection techniques. New algorithms are continuously introduced to shorten the detection time and improve classification accuracy. This minireview summarized the latest research of epilepsy detection techniques that focused on acquiring, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification of epileptic EEG signals. The application of seizure prediction and localization based on EEG signals in the diagnosis of epilepsy was also introduced. And then, the future development trend of epilepsy detection technology has prospected at the end of the article.

In this work, we consider whether a nonlinear extension of the Riemannian framework, obtained by replacing the channel-wise covariance of the EEG signal with the nonlinear distance covariance, improves decoding performance. We study the theoretical properties of the distance covariance metric in this framework, in particular invariance to affine transformations, and compare the proposed method with established Riemannian methods on three different EEG data sets. We do not find evidence that the distance covariance extension improves decoding performance in comparison to the linear Riemannian framework.

However, this approach requires users to perform specified tasks and their success or failure. In addition, the amount of attention needed for decision-making increases with the task difficulty, decreasing human feedback quality over time because of fatigue. Consequently, this can reduce the interaction quality and can even cause interaction breakdowns. To overcome these limitations and enable the interaction of robots with higher complexity tasks, we propose a closed-loop control system that learns affective responses to robot behaviors and provides natural feedback to optimize robot parameters for smoothing the next action. Experimental results demonstrate our affect-driven closed-loop control system yielded better affective outcomes and task performance than an open-loop system with correlated neuroscientific characteristics of EEG signals, thus enhancing the quality of human-robot interaction.

Methods: We analyzed data from a prospective observational cohort study of 719 consecutive critically ill children with encephalopathy who underwent clinically-indicated continuous EEG monitoring (CEEG). We implemented and compared three state-of-the-art machine learning methods for ES prediction: (1) random forest; (2) Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO); and (3) Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT). We developed a ranking algorithm based on the relative importance of each variable derived from the machine learning methods. Results: Based on our ranking algorithm, the top five variables for ES prediction were: (1) epileptiform discharges in the initial 30 minutes, (2) clinical seizures prior to CEEG initiation, (3) sex, (4) age dichotomized at 1 year, and (5) epileptic encephalopathy. Compared to the stepwise selection-based approach in logistic regression, the top variables selected by our ranking algorithm were more informative as models utilizing the top variables achieved better prediction performance evaluated by prediction accuracy, AUROC and F1 score. Adding additional variables did not improve and sometimes worsened model performance. Conclusion: The ranking algorithm was helpful in deriving a parsimonious model for ES prediction with optimal performance. However, application of state-of-the-art machine learning models did not substantially improve model performance compared to prior logistic regression models. Thus, to further improve the ES prediction, we may need to collect more samples and variables that provide additional information.

It can transform mental activities into relevant commands to control external equipment and establish direct communication pathway. Among different paradigms, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is widely used due to its certain periodicity and stability of control. However, electroencephalogram (EEG) of SSVEP is extremely weak and companied with multi-scale and strong noise. Existing algorithms for classification are based on the principle of template matching and spatial filtering, which cannot obtain satisfied performance of feature extraction under the multi-scale noise. Especially for the subjects produce weak response for external stimuli in EEG representation, i.e., BCI-Illiteracy subject, traditional algorithms are difficult to recognize the internal patterns of brain. To address this issue, a novel method based on Chaos theory is proposed to extract feature of SSVEP. The rule of this method is applying the peculiarity of nonlinear dynamics system to detect feature of SSVEP by judging the state changes of chaotic systems after adding weak EEG. To evaluate the validity of proposed method, this research recruit 32 subjects to participate the experiment. All subjects are divided into two groups according to the preliminary classification accuracy (mean acc >70% or < 70%) by canonical correlation analysis and we define the accuracy above 70% as group A (normal subjects), below 70% as group B (BCI-Illiteracy). Then, the classification accuracy and information transmission rate of two groups are verified using Chaotic theory. Experimental results show that all classification methods using in our study achieve good performance for normal subjects while chaos obtain excellent performance and significant improvements than traditional methods for BCI-Illiteracy.

J	Sai, CY; Mokhtar, N; Iwahashi, M; Cumming, P; Arof, H				Sai, Chong Yeh; Mokhtar, Norrima; Iwahashi, Masahiro; Cumming, Paul; Arof, Hamzah			Fully automated unsupervised artefact removal in multichannel electroencephalogram using wavelet-independent component analysis with density-based spatial clustering of application with noise	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							EEG ARTIFACTS; SVM	Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method for recording electrical activities arising from the cortical surface of the brain, which has found wide applications not just in clinical medicine, but also in neuroscience research and studies of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). However, EEG recordings often suffer from distortions due to artefactual components that degrade the true EEG signals. Artefactual components are any unwanted signals recorded in the EEG spectrum that originate from sources other than the neurophysiological activity of the human brain. Examples of the origin of artefactual components include eye blinking, facial or scalp muscles activities, and electrode slippage. Techniques for automated artefact removal such as Wavelet Transform and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been used to remove or reduce the effect of artefactual components on the EEG signals. However, detecting or identifying the signal artefacts to be removed presents a great challenge, as EEG signal properties vary between individuals and age groups. Techniques that rely on some arbitrarily defined threshold often fail to identify accurately the signal artefacts in a given dataset. In this study, a method is proposed using unsupervised machine learning coupled with Wavelet-ICA to remove EEG artefacts. Using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN), a classification accuracy of 97.9% is achieved in identifying artefactual components. DBSCAN achieved excellent and robust performance in identifying artefactual components during the Wavelet-ICA process, especially in consideration of the low-density nature of typical artefactual signals. This new hybrid method provides a scalable and unsupervised solution for automated artefact removal that should be applicable for a wide range of EEG data types.

J	Sun, H; Jin, J; Xu, R; Cichocki, A				Sun, Hao; Jin, Jing; Xu, Ren; Cichocki, Andrzej			Feature Selection Combining Filter and Wrapper Methods for Motor-Imagery Based Brain-Computer Interfaces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Motor imagery classification; CSP; feature selection; infinite latent feature selection; Wasserstein distance; improved binary gravitational search	PERFORMANCE	Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces help patients with movement disorders to regain the ability to control external devices. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a popular algorithm for feature extraction in decoding MI tasks. However, due to noise and nonstationarity in electroencephalography (EEG), it is not optimal to combine the corresponding features obtained from the traditional CSP algorithm. In this paper, we designed a novel CSP feature selection framework that combines the filter method and the wrapper method. We first evaluated the importance of every CSP feature by the infinite latent feature selection method. Meanwhile, we calculated Wasserstein distance between feature distributions of the same feature under different tasks. Then, we redefined the importance of every CSP feature based on two indicators mentioned above, which eliminates half of CSP features to create a new CSP feature subspace according to the new importance indicator. At last, we designed the improved binary gravitational search algorithm (IBGSA) by rebuilding its transfer function and applied IBGSA on the new CSP feature subspace to find the optimal feature set. To validate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three public BCI datasets and performed a numerical analysis of the proposed algorithm for MI classification. The accuracies were comparable to those reported in related studies and the presented model outperformed other methods in literature on the same underlying data.

J	Zhang, KS; Robinson, N; Lee, SW; Guan, CT				Zhang, Kaishuo; Robinson, Neethu; Lee, Seong-Whan; Guan, Cuntai			Adaptive transfer learning for EEG motor imagery classification with deep Convolutional Neural Network	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Transfer learning; Brain-computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalography (EEG); Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)		In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for developing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. However, for deep learning models trained entirely on the data from a specific individual, the performance increase has only been marginal owing to the limited availability of subject-specific data. To overcome this, many transfer-based approaches have been proposed, in which deep networks are trained using pre-existing data from other subjects and evaluated on new target subjects. This mode of transfer learning however faces the challenge of substantial inter-subject variability in brain data. Addressing this, in this paper, we propose 5 schemes for adaptation of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based electroencephalography (EEG)-BCI system for decoding hand motor imagery (MI). Each scheme fine-tunes an extensively trained, pre-trained model and adapt it to enhance the evaluation performance on a target subject. We report the highest subject independent performance with an average (N = 54) accuracy of 84.19% (+/- 9.98%) for two-class motor imagery, while the best accuracy on this dataset is 74.15% (+/- 15.83%) in the literature. Further, we obtain a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.005) in classification using the proposed adaptation schemes compared to the baseline subject-independent model.

Rajendra			Tetromino pattern based accurate EEG emotion classification model	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Tetromino; Features; EEG; Emotion; Classification; DWT	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; RECOGNITION; DIAGNOSIS; SIGNALS	Nowadays, emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is becoming a hot research topic. The aim of this paper is to classify emotions of EEG signals using a novel game-based feature generation function with high accuracy. Hence, a multileveled handcrafted feature generation automated emotion classification model using EEG signals is presented. A novel textural features generation method inspired by the Tetris game called Tetromino is proposed in this work. The Tetris game is one of the famous games worldwide, which uses various characters in the game. First, the EEG signals are subjected to discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to create various decomposition levels. Then, novel features are generated from the decomposed DWT sub-bands using the Tetromino method. Next, the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) features selection method is utilized to select the most discriminative features, and the selected features are classified using support vector machine classifier. Finally, each channel's results (validation predictions) are obtained, and the mode functionbased voting method is used to obtain the general results. We have validated our developed model using three databases (DREAMER, GAMEEMO, and DEAP). We have attained 100% accuracies using DREAMER and GAMEEMO datasets. Furthermore, over 99% of classification accuracy is achieved for DEAP dataset. Thus, our developed emotion detection model has yielded the best classification accuracy rate compared to the state-of-the-art techniques and is ready to be tested for clinical application after validating with more diverse datasets. Our results show the success of the presented Tetromino pattern-based EEG signal classification model validated using three public emotional EEG datasets.

Amalin			Automated EEG pathology detection based on different convolutional neural network models: Deep learning approach	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Pathology; Diagnosis; Convolutional neural network; Support vector machine; Abnormal EEG corpus		The brain electrical activity, recorded and materialized as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, is known to be very useful in the diagnosis of brain-related pathology. However, manual examination of these EEG signals has various limitations, including time-consuming inspections, the need for highly trained neurologists, and the subjectiveness of the evaluation. Thus, an automated EEG pathology detection system would be helpful to assist neurologists to enhance the treatment procedure by making a quicker diagnosis and reducing error due to the human element. This work proposes the application of a time-frequency spectrum to convert the EEG signals onto the image domain. The spectrum images are then applied to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn robust features that can aid the automatic detection of pathology and normal EEG signals. Three popular CNN in the form of the DenseNet, Inception-ResNet v2, and SeizureNet were employed. The extracted deep-learned features from the spectrum images are then passed onto the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was assessed using the publicly available Temple University Hospital (TUH) abnormal EEG corpus dataset, which is demographically balanced. The proposed SeizureNet-SVM-based system achieved state-of-the-art performance: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.65%, 90.48%, and 100%, respectively. The results show that the proposed framework may serve as a diagnostic tool to assist clinicians in the detection of EEG pathology for early treatment.	[Bajpai, Rishabh; Prince, A.

This work distinguished imagined speech and intended speech by employing the cortical EEG signals recorded from scalp. EEG signals from eleven subjects were recorded when they produced Mandarin-Chinese monosyllables in imagined speech and intended speech, and EEG features were classified by the common spatial pattern, time-domain, frequency-domain and Riemannian manifold based methods. The classification results indicated that the Riemannian manifold based method yielded the highest classification accuracy of 85.9% among the four classification methods. Moreover, the classification accuracy with the left-only brain electrode configuration was close to that with the whole brain electrode configuration. The findings of this work have potential to extend the output commands of silent speech interfaces.

Hebbian formalism and optimization are basic principles of brain function, and they provide an appealing approach for modeling word meanings based on word co-occurrences. We provide proof of concept that a statistical model of the semantic space can account for neural representations of both concrete and abstract words, using MEG. Here, we built a statistical model using word embeddings extracted from a text corpus. This statistical model was used to train a machine learning algorithm to successfully decode the MEG signals evoked by written words. In the model, word abstractness emerged from the statistical regularities of the language environment. Representational similarity analysis further showed that this salient property of the model co-varies, at 280-420 ms after visual word presentation, with activity in regions that have been previously linked with processing of abstract words, namely the left-hemisphere frontal, anterior temporal and superior parietal cortex. In light of these results, we propose that the neural encoding of word meanings can arise through statistical regularities, that is, through grounding in language itself.

Seizure likelihood varies with day-to-day variations in sleep duration in patients with refractory focal epilepsy: A longitudinal electroencephalography investigation	ECLINICALMEDICINE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizures; Convulsions; Sleep; Sleep quality; Sleep duration; Sleep composition; Sleep architecture; Rapid eye movement; Long-term; EEG; Electroencephalography; Non-rapid eye movement	PRECIPITANTS; DEPRIVATION; FREQUENCY; ADULTS; IMPACT	Background: While the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation (>24 h) on seizure occurrence has been thoroughly explored, little is known about the effects of day-to-day variations in the duration and quality of sleep on seizure probability. A better understanding of the interaction between sleep and seizures may help to improve seizure management. Methods: To explore how sleep and epileptic seizures are associated, we analysed continuous intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings collected from 10 patients with refractory focal epilepsy undergoing ordinary life activities between 2010 and 2012 from three clinical centres (Austin Health, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, and St Vincent's Hospital of the Melbourne University Epilepsy Group). A total of 4340 days of sleep-wake data were analysed (average 434 days per patient). EEG data were sleep scored using a semi automated machine learning approach into wake, stages one, two, and three non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep categories. Findings: Seizure probability changes with day-to-day variations in sleep duration. Logistic regression models revealed that an increase in sleep duration, by 1.66 +/- 0.52 h, lowered the odds of seizure by 27% in the following 48 h. Following a seizure, patients slept for longer durations and if a seizure occurred during sleep, then sleep quality was also reduced with increased time spent aroused from sleep and reduced rapid eye movement sleep. Interpretation: Our results suggest that day-to-day deviations from regular sleep duration correlates with changes in seizure probability. Sleeping longer, by 1.66 +/- 0.52 h, may offer protective effects for patients with refractory focal epilepsy, reducing seizure risk. Furthermore, the occurrence of a seizure may disrupt sleep patterns by elongating sleep and, if the seizure occurs during sleep, reducing its quality.

It could promote a more thorough understanding of cognitive control networks. For many years, the continuous performance task has been utilized to investigate impaired proactive and reactive cognitive functions. So far, mainly task performance and univariate electroencephalogram were involved in such investigations. In this study, we benefit from multi-variate pattern analysis of continuous performance task variations to provide a more complete spatio-temporal outline of information processing flow involved in sustained and transient attention and response preparation. Besides effects that are well in line with previous EEG research but could be described in more spatial and temporal detail by the used methods, our results could suggest the presence of a higher order feedback control system when expectations are violated. Such a feedback control is related to modulations of behavior both intra- and inter-individually.

An efficient tool for signal irregularity analysis is Sample Entropy (SampEn). In this context, our paper was elaborated. We used SampEn to design a Machine Learning model for brain state detection based on EEG signals, which allows to differentiate between healthy (H) subjects, epileptic subjects during seizures free intervals (E) and epileptic subjects during seizures (S). Two main novelties are presented in our paper. The first one is related to the outline of the designed machine learning model, signal derivatives are determined as preprocessing step, then extracted features are SampEn and Standard Deviation (STD) from EEG signals and its first and second derivatives. These features are firstly used to train a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier (KNN) and yield high accuracy. After that, we select the most relevant features and we design our proposed classifier that provides better accuracy. The second one is related to the performance of our model to overcome some crucial purposes. In addition to the highest achieved accuracy, 100% for seizure detection, 99.2% for epilepsy detection and 99.86% for three class classification cases, our model used few features and simple classifier which involves fast running time. That is why we can consider our model as a suitable tool for real time applications. Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.

The wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), entropies, and QBP methods are applied to EEG signals for identifying the non-focal and focal classes. The proposed approach consists of three strategies, based on the local pattern transformation of EEG signals using QBP. The time-domain EEG signals are transformed into the QBP domain, and histogram features are extracted in the first strategy. Secondly, the nonlinear features like sample entropy, log energy entropy, fuzzy entropy, permutation entropy, and approximate entropy are computed from the EEG signals and concatenated with the QBP features. In the third strategy, the EEG signals are decomposed into sub-bands by employing WPD, and histogram features based on QBP are extracted from each sub-band. The computed feature sets are used to classify the non-focal and focal EEG signals using an artificial neural network (ANN). For the selection of best settings in WPD, the EEG signals are decomposed in seven commonly used wavelet families with different decomposition levels, and the wavelet family providing the highest classification accuracy with the minimal computational cost is found out. The proposed approach is validated using the widely recognized Bern-Barcelona EEG dataset. The proposed method achieved a classification accuracy of 95.74 % on this dataset using the proposed WPD based QBP approach. In conclusion, the proposed approach is efficient in identifying the focal EEG signals and can be useful for accurate detection of focal regions in the epilepsy diagnosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Directly decoding imagined speech from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has attracted much interest in brain-computer interface applications, because it provides a natural and intuitive communication method for locked-in patients. Several methods have been applied to imagined speech decoding, but how to construct spatial-temporal dependencies and capture long-range contextual cues in EEG signals to better decode imagined speech should be considered. Approach. In this study, we propose a novel model called hybrid-scale spatial-temporal dilated convolution network (HS-STDCN) for EEG-based imagined speech recognition. HS-STDCN integrates feature learning from temporal and spatial information into a unified end-to-end model. To characterize the temporal dependencies of the EEG sequences, we adopted a hybrid-scale temporal convolution layer to capture temporal information at multiple levels. A depthwise spatial convolution layer was then designed to construct intrinsic spatial relationships of EEG electrodes, which can produce a spatial-temporal representation of the input EEG data. Based on the spatial-temporal representation, dilated convolution layers were further employed to learn long-range discriminative features for the final classification. Main results. To evaluate the proposed method, we compared the HS-STDCN with other existing methods on our collected dataset. The HS-STDCN achieved an averaged classification accuracy of 54.31% for decoding eight imagined words, which is significantly better than other methods at a significance level of 0.05. Significance. The proposed HS-STDCN model provided an effective approach to make use of both the temporal and spatial dependencies of the input EEG signals for imagined speech recognition. We also visualized the word semantic differences to analyze the impact of word semantics on imagined speech recognition, investigated the important regions in the decoding process, and explored the use of fewer electrodes to achieve comparable performance.

Preterm infants are reported to have a higher incidence of seizures compared to term infants. Preterm EEG morphology differs from that of term infants, which implies that seizure detection algorithms trained on term EEG may not be appropriate. The task of developing preterm specific algorithms becomes extra-challenging given the limited amount of annotated preterm EEG data available. This paper explores novel deep learning (DL) architectures for the task of neonatal seizure detection in preterm infants. The study tests and compares several approaches to address the problem: training on data from full-term infants; training on data from preterm infants; training on age-specific preterm data and transfer learning. The system performance is assessed on a large database of continuous EEG recordings of 575 h in duration. It is shown that the accuracy of a validated term-trained EEG seizure detection algorithm, based on a support vector machine classifier, when tested on preterm infants falls well short of the performance achieved for full-term infants. An AUC of 88.3% was obtained when tested on preterm EEG as compared to 96.6% obtained when tested on term EEG. When re-trained on preterm EEG, the performance marginally increases to 89.7%. An alternative DL approach shows a more stable trend when tested on the preterm cohort, starting with an AUC of 93.3% for the term-trained algorithm and reaching 95.0% by transfer learning from the term model using available preterit data. The proposed DI, approach avoids time-consuming explicit feature engineering and leverages the existence of the term seizure detection model, resulting in accurate predictions with a minimum amount of annotated preterm data.

The EEG electrodes sensitive, so the low amplitude EEG signals get corrupted by the wide spectrum and high amplitude electromyogram (EMG) signals. Hence, the recorded EEG have segments that have artifacts with the unacceptable state. Effectively recovering the corrupted signal from a single channel EEG is a challenge. The proposed algorithm enhances the single-channel EEG signal in the presence of EMG artifacts using extreme learning machine (ELM) regressor. For training and testing of the ELM network, EEG signals are subjected to S-transform and the obtained transformation matrix is used as the feature set. S-Transform has the advantage of uniquely combining the gradual resolution and complete referenced phase information for the subjected time series. The ELM is trained using both magnitude and phase of corrupted and clean EEG signals in pairs. This training can reduce the EMG artifact from corrupted EEG signals effectively and enhance the same in the testing stage. The evaluation parameters used for the proposed algorithm are the average root mean square error (RMSE) and the correlation coefficient (CC) between the ground truth EEG signal to the estimated EEG signal. The average RMSE and CC were found to be 0.260 and 0.97 respectively for the simulated dataset.

The complexity and suddenness of seizures make it difficult to obtain EEG signals. Therefore, the detection and diagnosis of epilepsy is challenging. Aiming at the poor classification and recognition effect of small sample epileptic EEG signals, this paper proposes a classification and recognition method based on signal enhancement. Firstly, the improved sliding window weighting method is used to remove the noise component and enhance the target signal. Then discrete wavelet transform is used to select the appropriate frequency band information, and non-zero processing is performed on the selected frequency band information, which can achieve the effect of feature enhancement in the feature extraction stage. Finally, the extracted features are input into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification and recognition. The experimental results on the public database show that the proposed method can effectively realize classification and recognition in the environment of small sample EEG signals, and the classification accuracy is 96.59%. This result proves the superiority of our method in the classification of healthy, inter-ictal state and seizure state EEG signals.

The unpredictability of seizures not only degrades the quality of life of the patients, but it can also be life-threatening. Modern systems monitoring electroencephalography (EEG) signals are being currently developed with the view to detect epileptic seizures in order to alert caregivers and reduce the impact of seizures on patients' quality of life. Such seizure detection systems employ state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that require a large amount of labeled personal data for training. However, acquiring EEG signals during epileptic seizures is a costly and time-consuming process for medical experts and patients. Furthermore, this data often contains sensitive personal information, presenting privacy concerns. In this work, we generate synthetic seizure-like brain electrical activities, i.e., EEG signals, that can be used to train seizure detection algorithms, alleviating the need for sensitive recorded data. Our experiments show that the synthetic seizure data generated with our GAN model succeeds at preserving the privacy of the patients without producing any degradation in performance during seizure monitoring.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a widely used signal for obtaining neural signals. In EEG decoding, EEG variability across different subjects critically degrades deep learning performance. In this paper, we propose a feature normalization method for reducing EEG variability with rest state EEG signals. The decoding structure is trained with a normalized feature which is normalized by subtracting the normalization feature extracted from the normalization structure. Experimental results show that the deep feature normalization algorithm dramatically enhances the performance of conventional deep learning algorithms.

These signals are captured for a visual perception task by showing digit images on a computer screen, and the task involves classification of the EEG signals into 10 classes, corresponding to the digits shown. The captured EEG signals are of very short duration (approx. 2sec), which are typically very noisy. We use a correlation based technique for the removal of highly noisy samples. Further, a sample refinement approach for the selection of relevant channels is also proposed. Both these steps constitute the data refinement process, which we demonstrate has a significant effect on the CNN classification performance. We validate the proposed approach on a publicly available MindBigData (The "MNIST" of Brain Digits) dataset.

Semantic decoding refers to the identification of semantic concepts from recordings of an individual's brain activity. It has been previously reported in functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We investigate whether semantic decoding is possible with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Specifically, we attempt to differentiate between the semantic categories of animals and tools. We also identify suitable mental tasks for potential brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. We explore the feasibility of a silent naming task, for the first time in fNIRS, and propose three novel intuitive mental tasks based on imagining concepts using three sensory modalities: visual, auditory, and tactile. Participants are asked to visualize an object in their minds, imagine the sounds made by the object, and imagine the feeling of touching the object. A general linear model is used to extract hemodynamic responses that are then classified via logistic regression in a univariate and multivariate manner. Main results. We successfully classify all tasks with mean accuracies of 76.2% for the silent naming task, 80.9% for the visual imagery task, 72.8% for the auditory imagery task, and 70.4% for the tactile imagery task. Furthermore, we show that consistent neural representations of semantic categories exist by applying classifiers across tasks. Significance. These findings show that semantic decoding is possible in fNIRS. The study is the first step toward the use of semantic decoding for intuitive BCI applications for communication.

It is the second most common neurological disease after Alzheimer's. The effects of epilepsy in children are serious, since it causes a slower growth rate and a failure to develop certain skills. In the medical field, specialists record brain activity using an Electroencephalogram (EEG) to observe the epileptic seizures. The detection of these seizures is performed by specialists, but the results might not be accurate due to human errors; therefore, automated detection of epileptic pediatric seizures might be the optimal solution. This paper investigates the detection of epileptic seizures by applying supervised machine learning techniques. The techniques applied on the data of patients with ages seven years and below from children's hospital boston massachusetts institute of technology (CHB-MIT) scalp EEG database of epileptic pediatric signals. A group of Naive Bayes (NB), Support vector machine (SVM), Logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Linear discernment (LD), Decision tree (DT), and ensemble learning methods were applied to the classification process. The results demonstrated the out-performance of the present study by achieving 100% for all parameters using the Ensemble learning model in contrast to state-of-the-art studies in the literature. Similarly, the SVM model achieved performance with 98.3% for sensitivity, 97.7% for specificity, and 98% for accuracy. The results of the LD and LR models reveal the lower performance i.e., the sensitivity at 66.9%-68.9%, specificity at 73.5%-77.1%, and accuracy at 70.2%-73%.

J	Dokur, Z; Olmez, T				Dokur, Zumray; Olmez, Tamer			Classification of motor imagery electroencephalogram signals by using a divergence based convolutional neural network	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						EEG; Motor imagery; Classification; Data augmentation; Convolutional neural network	SPATIAL-PATTERNS; EEG	Deep neural networks (DNNs) are observed to be successful in pattern classification. However, the high classification performances of DNNs are related to their large training sets. Unfortunately, in the literature, the datasets used to classify motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain a small number of samples. To achieve high performances with small-sized datasets, most of the studies have employed a transformation such as the common spatial patterns (CSP) before the classification process. However, the CSP is dependent on subjects and introduces computational load in real time applications. It is observed in the literature that data augmentation is not applied for increasing the classification performance of EEG signals. In this study, we have investigated the effect of the augmentation process on the classification performance of MI EEG signals instead of using a preceding transformation such as the CSP, and we have demonstrated that the augmentation process is able to compete with the CSP by generating high success rates for the classification of MI EEGs. In addition to the augmentation process, we have modified the DNN structure to increase the classification performance, to decrease the number of nodes in the structure, and to use less number of hyper parameters. A minimum distance network following the last layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN) was used as the classifier instead of a fully connected neural network (FCNN). By augmenting the EEG dataset and focusing solely on CNN's training, the training algorithm of the proposed structure is strengthened without applying any transformation. We tested these improvements on brain-computer interface (BCI) competitions 2005 and 2008 databases with two and four classes, and the positive effects of the augmentation on the average accuracies are demonstrated.

J	Brari, Z; Belghith, S				Brari, Zayneb; Belghith, Safya			A Novel Machine Learning Model for the Detection of Epilepsy and Epileptic Seizures Using Electroencephalographic Signals Based on Chaos and Fractal Theories	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							EEG SIGNALS; FEATURES	Machine learning is an expanding research area. Its main application is in the medical field and particularly the detection of epilepsy and epileptic seizures through electroencephalographic signals (EEG). It aims to design an intelligent framework that enables an immediate diagnosis of this disease without neurological consultation and thus saves the lives of the epileptic patients by detecting seizures and warning them before it happens. However, as a real-time application, this kind of framework faces several challenges such as accuracy, fast responses, and optimal memory usage. Within this context, our work was carried out. We propose a new machine learning framework based on chaos and fractal theories. Two main novelties are presented in this paper. Firstly, we propose a new method for signal preprocessing, and we reconstruct new versions of studied EEG signals using derivative determination and chaotic injection. Secondly, we suggest a new method for fractal analysis using Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD). In fact, HFDs extracted from EEG derivatives lead to detect epilepsy, whereas HFDs extracted from EEG with a chaotic signal injection lead to seizure detection. In addition, feature fusion helped to linearize all classification problems. An experimental study using the Bonn EEG database proves the efficiency of our contributions in comparison to published research. An accuracy of 100% was achieved in different classification cases using few features and a simple linear classifier.

Grading hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonatal EEG with convolutional neural networks and quadratic time-frequency distributions	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; time-frequency distribution; convolutional neural network		Objective. To develop an automated system to classify the severity of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy injury (HIE) in neonates from the background electroencephalogram (EEG). Approach. By combining a quadratic time-frequency distribution (TFD) with a convolutional neural network, we develop a system that classifies 4 EEG grades of HIE. The network learns directly from the two-dimensional TFD through 3 independent layers with convolution in the time, frequency, and time-frequency directions. Computationally efficient algorithms make it feasible to transform each 5 min epoch to the time-frequency domain by controlling for oversampling to reduce both computation and computer memory. The system is developed on EEG recordings from 54 neonates. Then the system is validated on a large unseen dataset of 338 h of EEG recordings from 91 neonates obtained across multiple international centres. Main results. The proposed EEG HIE-grading system achieves a leave-one-subject-out testing accuracy of 88.9% and kappa of 0.84 on the development dataset. Accuracy for the large unseen test dataset is 69.5% (95% confidence interval, CI: 65.3%-73.6%) and kappa of 0.54, which is a significant (P < 0.001) improvement over a state-of-the-art feature-based method with an accuracy of 56.8% (95% CI: 51.4%-61.7%) and kappa of 0.39. Performance of the proposed system was unaffected when the number of channels in testing was reduced from 8 to 2-accuracy for the large validation dataset remained at 69.5% (95% CI: 65.5%-74.0%). Significance. The proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for EEG grade classification on a large multi-centre unseen dataset, indicating the potential to assist clinical decision making for neonates with HIE.

We can quantitatively evaluate the segregation capability by modeling a relationship between the speech signals present in an auditory scene, and the listener's cortical signals measured using electroencephalography (EEG). This has opened up avenues to integrate neuro-feedback into hearing aids where the device can infer user's attention and enhance the attended speaker. Commonly used algorithms to infer the auditory attention are based on linear systems theory where cues such as speech envelopes are mapped on to the EEG signals. Here, we present a joint convolutional neural network (CNN)-long short-term memory (LSTM) model to infer the auditory attention. Our joint CNN-LSTM model takes the EEG signals and the spectrogram of the multiple speakers as inputs and classifies the attention to one of the speakers. We evaluated the reliability of our network using three different datasets comprising of 61 subjects, where each subject undertook a dual-speaker experiment. The three datasets analyzed corresponded to speech stimuli presented in three different languages namely German, Danish, and Dutch. Using the proposed joint CNN-LSTM model, we obtained a median decoding accuracy of 77.2% at a trial duration of 3 s. Furthermore, we evaluated the amount of sparsity that the model can tolerate by means of magnitude pruning and found a tolerance of up to 50% sparsity without substantial loss of decoding accuracy.

Methods A sample of 95 EEGs with epileptic seizure patterns matched with 95 seizure-free control sequences were extracted from EEG video monitoring data. They were stripped of all additional information. These plain EEG recordings were evaluated by two board certified EEG reviewers. The results were compared with the interpretations of the original video monitoring evaluations. Results Using the plain EEG sequences, epileptic seizure patterns were detected with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.758 and 0.958, respectively. The classification of the seizure pattern localization and lateralization differed in 56% and 50%, respectively, from the results of the video monitoring evaluations. Conclusion Additional information about the patient and the events during an EEG recording leads to a clinically and statistically significant increase in the seizure detection rates. These results imply that the human evaluation of a plain EEG without further information may not be seen as the gold standard in EEG evaluation. The performance estimation of automated EEG evaluation methods should take this into account.

These fatalities can be mitigated by incorporating driver state information with current Driver Safety Systems (DSS). There are primarily two driver cognitive states: Focused and Distracted. These states can be predicted using Machine Learning algorithms (ML) such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using extracted biomedical features like Electroencephalography (EEG), Electromyography (EMG), Heart Rate and Eye Tracking. This literature review summarizes all biomedical signals that are used in the assessment of driver cognitive states. A thorough literature review in this field identifies eye tracking as the most efficient and quick technique of real time driver state identification. Hence, this paper outlines the latest techniques in eye tracking using oculometry. This review paper also highlights unique ocular feature extraction techniques that can be extremely useful for future researches conducted in the field of driver state recognition.

In this study, knowledge discovery processes were implemented to build classi-fication models to predict hypoxia from wearable, dry-EEG sensor data collected from 85 participants in a two-phase study. Over a 35-minute period and while wearing aviation flight masks which regulated their oxygen intake, participants would alternate between a 2-minute cognitive test on CogScreen Hypoxia Edition and a 3-minute simulated flying task on X-Plane 11, with the oxygen concentration reducing every 5 min following the simulated flight task. The decrease in oxygen each 5 min simulated an increase in altitude. Features extracted from the EEG waveforms were transformed using principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Nave Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and neural network algorithms were utilized to classify the transformed brain wave data as either normal or hypoxic. The algorithms sensitivity ranged from 0.83 to 1.00 while the specificity ranged from 0.91 to 1.00. This study makes a step forward in developing a real-time, in-flight hypoxia detection system.

In this paper, we proposed a two-dimensional dictionary optimization (TDDO) method to directly improve the performance of SRC. New Method: Firstly, an initial dictionary was constructed with multi-band features extracted by filter band common spatial pattern (FBCSP). Then Lasso regression is used to select significant features in each atom synchronously in the horizontal direction, and the KNN-based method is used to clean up noise atoms in the vertical direction. Finally, an SRC method by training samples linearly representing test samples was implemented in classification. Results: The results show the necessity and rationality of TDDO-SRC method. The highest average classification accuracy of 86.5% and 92.4% is obtained on two public datasets. Comparison with Existing Method(s): The proposed method has more superior classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and existing winners' methods. Conclusions: The quality of dictionary construction has a great impact on the robustness of SRC. And compared with the original SRC, the classification accuracy of the optimized TDDO-SRC is greatly improved.

This framework implants transfer learning into the exemplar-based clustering model to improve the utilization rate of EEG signals. Starting from Bayesian probability theory, by leveraging Kullback-Leibler distance, we measure the similarity relationship between source and target data. Furthermore, we embed this relationship into the calculation of similarity matrix involved in the exemplar-based clustering model. Then we sum up a new objective function and study this new TrEEM scheme earnestly. We optimize the proposed TrEEM model by borrowing the mechanism utilized in EEM. In contrast to other machine learning models, experiments based on synthetic and real-world EEG datasets show that the performance of the proposed TrEEM is very promising.

Non-invasive wearable seizure detection using long-short-term memory networks with transfer learning	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						seizure detection; machine learning; wearable devices; epilepsy	TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES; AUTOMATED SEIZURE; IMPLANTED DEVICE; EPILEPSY; VALIDATION; SYSTEM	Objective. The detection of seizures using wearable devices would improve epilepsy management, but reliable detection of seizures in an ambulatory environment remains challenging, and current studies lack concurrent validation of seizures using electroencephalography (EEG) data. Approach. An adaptively trained long-short-term memory deep neural network was developed and trained using a modest number of seizure data sets from wrist-worn devices. Transfer learning was used to adapt a classifier that was initially trained on intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals to facilitate classification of non-EEG physiological datasets comprising accelerometry, blood volume pulse, skin electrodermal activity, heart rate, and temperature signals. The algorithm's performance was assessed with and without pre-training on iEEG signals and transfer learning. To assess the performance of the seizure detection classifier using long-term ambulatory data, wearable devices were used for multiple months with an implanted neurostimulator capable of recording iEEG signals, which provided independent electrographic seizure detections that were reviewed by a board-certified epileptologist. Main results. For 19 motor seizures from 10 in-hospital patients, the algorithm yielded a mean area under curve (AUC), a sensitivity, and an false alarm rate per day (FAR/day) of 0.98, 0.93, and 2.3, respectively. Additionally, for eight seizures with probable motor semiology from two ambulatory patients, the classifier achieved a mean AUC of 0.97 and an FAR of 2.45 events/day at a sensitivity of 0.9. For all seizure types in the ambulatory setting, the classifier had a mean AUC of 0.82 with a sensitivity of 0.47 and an FAR of 7.2 events/day. Significance. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using motor and non-motor seizures during in-hospital and ambulatory use. The classifier was able to detect multiple types of motor and non-motor seizures, but performed significantly better on motor seizures.

In a first experiment, we setup an ecological paradigm measuring EEG on a musician in free improvised concerts with an audience, followed by retrospective rating of the mental state of the improviser. We introduce Subjective Temporal Resolution (STR), a retrospective rating assessing the instantaneous quantization of subjective timing of the improviser. We identified high and low STR states using Hidden Markov Models in two performances, and were able to decode those states using supervised learning on instantaneous EEG power spectrum, showing increases in theta and alpha power with high STR values. In a second experiment, we found an increase of theta and beta power when experimentally manipulating STR in a musical improvisation imagery experiment. These results are interpreted with respect to previous research on flow state in creativity, as well as with the temporal processing literature. We suggest that a component of the subjective state of musical improvisation may be reflected in an underlying mechanism related to the subjective quantization of time. We also demonstrate the feasibility of single case studies of musical improvisation using brain activity measurements and retrospective reports, by obtaining consistent results across multiple sessions.

Identification of Negative BOLD Responses in Epilepsy Using Windkessel Models	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						negative BOLD responses; Windkessel models; hemodynamic response function; general linear model; machine learning; epilepsy; EEG-fMRI multimodal	VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFICATION; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; JOINT DETECTION-ESTIMATION; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; EEG-FMRI; BLOOD-FLOW; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; INTERICTAL SPIKES	Alongside positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses associated with interictal epileptic discharges, a variety of negative BOLD responses (NBRs) are typically found in epileptic patients. Previous studies suggest that, in general, up to four mechanisms might underlie the genesis of NBRs in the brain: (i) neuronal disruption of network activity, (ii) altered balance of neurometabolic/vascular couplings, (iii) arterial blood stealing, and (iv) enhanced cortical inhibition. Detecting and classifying these mechanisms from BOLD signals are pivotal for the improvement of the specificity of the electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) image modality to identify the seizure-onset zones in refractory local epilepsy. This requires models with physiological interpretation that furnish the understanding of how these mechanisms are fingerprinted by their BOLD responses. Here, we used a Windkessel model with viscoelastic compliance/inductance in combination with dynamic models of both neuronal population activity and tissue/blood O-2 to classify the hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) linked to the above mechanisms in the irritative zones of epileptic patients. First, we evaluated the most relevant imprints on the BOLD response caused by variations of key model parameters. Second, we demonstrated that a general linear model is enough to accurately represent the four different types of NBRs. Third, we tested the ability of a machine learning classifier, built from a simulated ensemble of HRFs, to predict the mechanism underlying the BOLD signal from irritative zones. Cross-validation indicates that these four mechanisms can be classified from realistic fMRI BOLD signals. To demonstrate proof of concept, we applied our methodology to EEG-fMRI data from five epileptic patients undergoing neurosurgery, suggesting the presence of some of these mechanisms. We concluded that a proper identification and interpretation of NBR mechanisms in epilepsy can be performed by combining general linear models and biophysically inspired models.

However, it is still challenging to train CNNs on multiple subjects' EEG without decreasing individual performance. This is known as the negative transfer problem, i.e. learning from dissimilar distributions causes CNNs to misrepresent each of them instead of learning a richer representation. As a result, CNNs cannot directly use multiple subjects' EEG to enhance model performance directly. To address this problem, we extend deep transfer learning techniques to the EEG multi-subject training case. We propose a multi-branch deep transfer network, the Separate-Common-Separate Network (SCSN) based on splitting the network's feature extractors for individual subjects. We also explore the possibility of applying Maximum-mean discrepancy (MMD) to the SCSN (SCSN-MMD) to better align distributions of features from individual feature extractors. The proposed network is evaluated on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset (BCICIV2a dataset) and our online recorded dataset. Results show that the proposed SCSN (81.8%, 53.2%) and SCSN-MMD (81.8%, 54.8%) outperformed the benchmark CNN (73.4%, 48.8%) on both datasets using multiple subjects. Our proposed networks show the potential to utilise larger multi-subject datasets to train an EEG decoder without being influenced by negative transfer.	[Wei, Xiaoxi; Ortega, Pablo; Faisal, A.

The main examination of epilepsy diagnosis is encephalography since its acquisition simplicity, low cost and significant results. However, the exploitation of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals require a neurological consultation, which is very time-consuming and it is not possible at all times. Recently, several published research propose different machine learning systems for EEG signals classification to detect patients' brain states, healthy, epileptic during seizures free intervals and epileptic during seizures. Developed systems deal with real-time applications requirement, in addition to program accuracy, run time must be as short as possible and uses the lowest storage memory. So, proposed systems must be based on a simple model using few features that are fast calculated and classified by a simple method. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for EEG features extraction based on a new method for the determination of the Correlation Dimension (CD). The experimental test through a benchmark database shows the efficiency of our method in comparison to other published works. In terms of reliability, we achieve an accuracy of 100 % for almost all classification problems with specific combinations of subsets. In terms of program simplicity, we use few features and fast running model. Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.

It has been demonstrated that it is possible to use electroencephalography (EEG) signals to infer to which speaker someone is attending by relating the neural activity to the speech signals. However, classifying auditory attention within a short time interval remains the main challenge. We present a convolutional neural network-based approach to extract the locus of auditory attention (left/right) without knowledge of the speech envelopes. Our results show that it is possible to decode the locus of attention within 1-2 s, with a median accuracy of around 81%. These results are promising for neuro-steered noise suppression in hearing aids, in particular in scenarios where per-speaker envelopes are unavailable.

This study uses phase amplitude coupling (PAC) in resting state magnetoencephalography to automatically lateralize TLE focus. Methods: Fifty-four patients with drug resistant TLE and 21 healthy controls who underwent MEG were considered for the study. Classification was carried out for PAC calculated for source transformed resting state of controls vs left TLE (LTLE)/right TLE (RTLE) and LTLE vs RTLE between beta, low-gamma and high-gamma as high frequency (HF) bands and low frequency (LF) 1-13 Hz, with decision tree (DT), support vector machines (SVM) and naive Bayes with feature selection by chi-square test. Further, lateralization classification was also calculated with LF sub-bands (delta, theta, alpha). Results: PAC was higher in the TLE compared to controls. LTLE and RTLE showed differences in low gamma-alpha and high gamma-delta coupling (p < 0.05). Accuracy was highest with SVM between controls and LTLE in the low gamma-LF (92.92%, AUC-1), between controls and RTLE in DT and SVM (93.54%, AUC-0.97, 1) in the low gamma-LF band and in low gamma-delta band in SVM (92.04%, AUC-1) between LTLE and RTLE. Conclusions: PAC shows distinct patterns of coupling in each subject group. Feature selection showed involvement of major network hubs and resting state networks. SVM showed best classification potential in the low gamma band. Significance: PAC in resting state MEG can supplement pre-surgical evaluation in drug resistant TLE.

Due to its noninvasive acquisition process, it is often used to investigate the presence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other common forms of neurodegerative disorders due to brain changes, that occur most frequently in older adults. Early detection of prodromal stages of AD, in which an individual has mild but measurable cognitive deficiencies with no significant effect on the functional activity of daily living, may help to reduce mortality and morbidity. This paper proposes an investigation of the classification of AD from EEG signal using robust-principal component analysis (R-PCA) feature extraction algorithm. Four widely used machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes have been implemented and compared by using a custom dataset composed of 13 subjects healthy or affected by AD in order to asses their classification performance.

Acquiring signals from the surface of the brain is a difficult task due to the low amplitude electric processes that occur. The recorded waves are usually contaminated with other biosignals with higher amplitude. These artefacts affect the quality of the signals leading to difficulty in decoding the desired brain activities. In this paper we focus on eliminating the electrooculogram from the electroencephalogram signals collected during imagined speech. We compared two preprocessing methods: the Adaptive Filter and Principal Component Analysis decomposition and concluded that both methods improve the quality of the EEG signals. However, the developed PCA method turned out to offer better results regarding the correlation between signals from the same class.

It is estimated that by 2050 around 1.2% of the world's population will suffer from these diseases. Since there are no effective treatment options available, it is of great importance to detect dementia tendencies at the earliest possible stage. Mild cognitive impairment represents a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease, allowing detecting dementia tendencies prematurely. As related work either relies on sensitive test results, does not manifest a sophisticated level of accuracy, or relies on costly techniques, further research is required. In this study, we propose a machine learning approach using resting-state EEG recordings of channels located in the Broca's area.

Spatial and spectral features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) are critical for the classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks. As prevalently used methods, the common spatial pattern (CSP) and filter bank CSP (FBCSP) can effectively extract spatial-spectral features from MI-related EEG. To further improve the separability of the CSP features, we proposed a distinguishable spatial-spectral feature learning neural network (DSSFLNN) framework for MI-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in this study. Approach. The first step of the DSSFLNN framework was to extract FBCSP features from raw EEG signals. Then two squeeze-and-excitation modules were used to re-calibrate CSP features along the band-wise axis and the class-wise axis, respectively. Next, we used a parallel convolutional neural network module to learn distinguishable spatial-spectral features. Finally, the distinguishable spatial-spectral features were fed to a fully connected layer for classification. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we compared it with the state-of-the-art methods on BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b. Main results. The results showed that the DSSFLNN framework can achieve a mean Cohen's kappa value of 0.7 on two datasets, which outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, two additional experiments were conducted and they proved that the combination of band-wise feature learning and class-wise feature learning can achieve significantly better performance than only using either one of them. Significance. The proposed DSSFLNN can effectively improve the decoding performance of MI-based BCIs.

Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) records interictal and ictal activities of the epilepsy in order to precisely find and localize epileptogenic zones in clinical practice. While it is difficult to find distinct ictal onset patterns generated the seizure onset zone from SEEG recordings in a confined region, high frequency oscillations are commonly considered as putative biomarkers for the identification of epileptogenic zones. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of high frequency oscillations in SEEG signals is crucial for timely clinical evaluation. This work formulates the detection of high frequency oscillations as a signal segment classification problem and develops a hypergraph-based detector to automatically detect high frequency oscillations such that human experts can visually review SEEG signals. We evaluated our method on 4,000 signal segments from clinical SEEG recordings that contain both ictal and interictal data obtained from 19 patients who suffer from refractory focal epilepsy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detector that can successfully localize interictal high frequency oscillations and outperforms multiple peer machine learning methods. In particular, the proposed detector achieved 90.7% in accuracy, 80.9% in sensitivity, and 96.9% in specificity.

More specifically, we learn an end-to-end model that recognizes natural images or motor imagery by the EEG data that is collected from the corresponding human neural activities. In order to capture the temporal information encoded in the long EEG sequences, we first employ an enhanced version of Transformer, i.e., gated Transformer, on EEG signals to learn the feature representation along a sequence of embeddings. Then a fully-connected Softmax layer is used to predict the classification results of the decoded representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the gated Transformer approach, we conduct experiments on the image classification task for a human brain-visual dataset and the classification task for a motor imagery dataset. The experimental results show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance compared to multiple existing methods that are widely used for EEG classification.

To bridge this gap, we applied a novel paradigm in psychology, the gradual-onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), to collect the ground truth of attention states. GradCPT allows for the precise labeling of attention fluctuation on an 800 ms time scale. We then developed a new technique for measuring continuous attention fluctuation, based on a machine learning approach that uses the spectral properties of EEG signals as the main features. We demonstrated that, even using a consumer grade EEG device, the detection accuracy of moment-to-moment attention fluctuations was 73.49%. Next, we empirically validated our technique in a video learning scenario and found that our technique match with the classification obtained through thought probes, with an average F1 score of 0.77. Our results suggest the effectiveness of using gradCPT as a ground truth labeling method and the feasibility of using consumer-grade EEG devices for continuous attention fluctuation detection.

We sought to compare the efficiency of four PNES classification systems. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical and video-electroencephalography (VEEG) records of patients with PNES with at least one typical event recorded on VEEG. Semiology of PNES events was stringently classified using Hubsch, Dhiman, Wadwekar, and Asadi-Pooya's classification systems. Results: We studied 248 patients with PNES (78% females, mean age 23.1 +/- 10.3 years) and reviewed 498 PNES events. Using Hubsch's scheme, we classified events into: dystonic attacks with primitive gestural activity (5.2%), paucikinetic attacks with preserved responsiveness (9.7%), pseudosyncope (59.8%), hyperkinetic prolonged attacks (16.2%) and axial dystonic prolonged attacks (1.6%), and unclassified (7.5%). Using Dhiman's classification, events were: abnormal motor (hypermotor [10.4%]/ partial motor [12.7%]), dialeptic type (58.6%), mixed patterns (17.3%), and unclassified (1%). Using Wadwekar's classification: dystonic attacks with primitive gestural activity (5.2%), paucikinetic attacks with preserved responsiveness (9.6%), pseudosyncope with/without hyperventilation (65.1%), hyperkinetic prolonged attacks involving limbs +/- trunk (18.5%), and axial dystonic prolonged attacks (1.6%). Using AsadiPooya's classification, events were: hypermotor (30.1%), non-motor (62.9%), and mixed (7.0%). All events could be classified via Wadwekar and Asadi-Pooya systems. Conclusion: In our study, pseudosyncope/dialeptic/non-motor semiology emerged as most frequent. Most of our patients with PNES had stereotyped semiology. All events could be classified using the schemes by Asadi-Pooya and Wadweker et al. Dhiman et al. scheme could classify 99% and 7.5% remained unclassified using Hubsch et al. scheme.

Discovering the brain stages of lexical decision: Behavioral effects originate from a single neural decision process	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Lexical decision; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Machine learning; Multivariate pattern analysis; Hidden semi-Markov Models	VISUAL-WORD RECOGNITION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; DIFFUSION-MODEL ACCOUNT; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; EEG-DATA; FREQUENCY; REPETITION; ERP; IDENTIFICATION; ACTIVATION	Lexical decision (LD) - judging whether a sequence of letters constitutes a word - has been widely investigated. In a typical lexical decision task (LDT), participants are asked to respond whether a sequence of letters is an actual word or a nonword. Although behavioral differences between types of words/nonwords have been robustly detected in LDT, there is an ongoing discussion about the exact cognitive processes that underlie the word identification process in this task. To obtain data-driven evidence on the underlying processes, we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data and applied a novel machine-learning method, hidden semi-Markov model multivariate pattern analysis (HsMM-MVPA). In the current study, participants performed an LDT in which we varied the frequency of words (high, low frequency) and "wordlikeness" of non-words (pseudowords, random non-words). The results revealed that models with six processing stages accounted best for the data in all conditions. While most stages were shared, Stage 5 differed between conditions. Together, these results indicate that the differences in word frequency and lexicality effects are driven by a single cognitive processing stage. Based on its latency and topology, we interpret this stage as a Decision process during which participants discriminate between words and nonwords using activated lexical information.

Growing evidence suggests that electroencephalography (EEG) electrode (sensor) potential time series (PTS) of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) hold motor neural correlates that can be used for motion trajectory prediction, commonly by multiple linear regression (mLR). It is not yet known whether arm-joint trajectories can be reliably decoded from current sources, computed from sensor data, from which brain areas they can be decoded and using which neural features. Approach. In this study, the PTS of 44 sensors were fed into sLORETA source localization software to compute current source activity in 30 regions of interest (ROIs) found in a recent meta-analysis to be engaged in action execution, motor imagery and motor preparation. The current sources PTS and band-power time series (BTS) in several frequency bands and time lags were used to predict actual and imagined trajectories in 3D space of the three velocity components of the hand, elbow and shoulder of nine subjects using an mLR model. Main results. For all arm joints and movement types, current source SCPs PTS contributed most to trajectory reconstruction with time lags 150, 116 and 84 ms providing the highest contribution, and current source BTS in any of the tested frequency bands was not informative. Person's correlation coefficient (r) averaged across movement types, arm joints and velocity components using source data was slightly lower than using sensor data (r = 0.25 and r = 0.28, respectively). For each ROI, the three current source dipoles had different contribution to the reconstruction of each of the three velocity components. Significance. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting of actual and imagined 3D trajectories of all arm joints from current sources, computed from scalp EEG. These findings may be used by developers of a future BCI as a validated set of contributing ROIs.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-rhythm capsule network (FBCapsNet) that uses as little EEG information as possible with key features to classify motor imagery and further improves the classification efficiency. The network conforms to a small recognition model with only 3 acquisition channels but it can effectively use the limited data for feature learning. Based on the BCI Competition IV 2b data set, experimental results show that the proposed network can achieve 2.41% better performance than existing cutting-edge methods.

We consider the possibility to extend a set of supported models by introducing the oracle service and exploring the usability of blockchain-based architecture. The investigated architecture combines an oracle service with a Hyperledger Fabric chaincode. We compared two logistic regression implementations in Go language-a pure chaincode and an oracle service-at various data (2-32 k instances) and network (3-13 peers) sizes. Experiments were run to assess the performance of blockchain-based model inference using 2D synthetic and EEG eye state datasets for a supervised machine learning detection task. The benchmarking results showed that the impact on performance is acceptable with the median overhead of oracle service reaching 2-4%, depending on the dimensionality of the dataset. The overhead tends to diminish at large dataset sizes with the runtime depending on the network size linearly, where additional peers increased the runtime by 6.3 and 6.6 s for 2D and EEG datasets, respectively. Demonstrated negligible difference between implementations justifies the flexible choice of model in the blockchain-based federated learning and other machine learning applications.

J	Wang, F; Ping, JY; Xu, ZF; Bi, JY				Wang, Fei; Ping, Jingyu; Xu, Zongfeng; Bi, Jinying			Classification of motor imagery using multisource joint transfer learning	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY; EEG; TIME	As an important way for human-computer interaction, the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) can decode personal motor intention directly by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, a large amount of labeled data has to be collected for each new subject since EEG patterns vary between individuals. The long calibration phase severely limits the further development of MI-BCI. To tackle this problem, multi-source joint domain adaption (MJDA) and multi-source joint Riemannian adaption (MJRA) algorithms are proposed in this paper. Both methods aim to transfer knowledge from other subjects to the current subject who has only a small amount of labeled data. First, the common spatial pattern with Euclidean alignment is used to select source subjects who have similar spatial patterns to the target subject. Second, the covariance matrices of EEG trials are aligned in Riemannian space by removing subject-specific baselines. These two steps are shared by MJDA and MJRA. In the last step, MJDA attempts to minimize the feature distribution mismatch in the Riemannian tangent space, while MJRA attempts to find an adaptive Riemannian classifier. Finally, the proposed methods are validated on two datasets: BCI Competition IV 2a and online event-related desynchronization (ERD)-BCI. The experimental results demonstrate that both MJDA and MJRA outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. The MJDA provides a new idea for the offline analysis of MI-BCI, while MJRA could make a big difference to the online calibration of MI-BCI.

One novel alternative to traditional controls is the use of Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) systems and Motor Imagery (MI), using data from the user's brain in the form of electroencephalography (EEG) waves. While some research has explored the use of BMI with virtual environments, the use of MI in an AR system has not been explored for use in training how to accomplish a procedural task. Therefore, this paper presents a BMI system combined with AR, to create a framework that allows for hands-free traversal of a predefined instruction-set for training using user brain activity. The created prototype allows for control of an AR environment using three modalities: brain activity, voice commands, and hand gestures. The created BMI-AR prototype allows for control of navigation through a predetermined instruction set using a user's brain waves or voice commands, as well as allow users to see their passive EEG readings of affective mental state in real time. The initial prototype resulted in promising initial machine learning (ML) accuracy scores for motor imagery (MI) tasks.

The most suitable approach to address this issue is to analyze the EEG signals of individual subjects independently recorded before the main BCI tasks, to evaluate their performance on these tasks. This study mainly focused on non-linear analyses and deep learning techniques to investigate the significant relationship between the intrinsic characteristics of a prior idle resting state and the subsequent BCI performance. To achieve this main objective, a public EEG motor/movement imagery dataset that constituted two individual EEG signals recorded from an idle resting state and a motor imagery BCI task was used in this study. For the EEG processing in the prior resting state, spectral analysis but also non-linear analyses, such as sample entropy, permutation entropy, and recurrent quantification analyses (RQA), were performed to obtain individual groups of EEG features to represent intrinsic EEG characteristics in the subject. For the EEG signals in the BCI tasks, four individual decoding methods, as a filter-bank common spatial pattern-based classifier and three types of convolution neural network-based classifiers, quantified the subsequent BCI performance in the subject. Statistical linear regression and ANOVA with post hoc analyses verified the significant relationship between non-linear EEG features in the prior resting state and three types of BCI performance as low-, intermediate-, and high-performance groups that were statistically discriminated by the subsequent BCI performance. As a result, we found that the frontal theta rhythm ranging from 4 to 8 Hz during the eyes open condition was highly associated with the subsequent BCI performance. The RQA findings that higher determinism and lower mean recurrent time were mainly observed in higher-performance groups indicate that more regular and stable properties in the EEG signals over the frontal regions during the prior resting state would provide a critical clue to assess an individual BCI ability in the following motor imagery task.

Resting EEG theta connectivity and alpha power to predict repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation response in depression: A non-replication from the ICON-DB consortium	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Replication; Alpha power; Theta connectivity; rTMS; Depression; ICON-DB; EEG		Objective: Our previous research showed high predictive accuracy at differentiating responders from non-responders to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for depression using resting electroencephalography (EEG) and clinical data from baseline and one-week following treatment onset using a machine learning algorithm. In particular, theta (4-8 Hz) connectivity and alpha power (8-13 Hz) significantly differed between responders and non-responders. Independent replication is a necessary step before the application of potential predictors in clinical practice. This study attempted to replicate the results in an independent dataset. Methods: We submitted baseline resting EEG data from an independent sample of participants who underwent rTMS treatment for depression (N = 193, 128 responders) (Krepel et al., 2018) to the same between group comparisons as our previous research (Bailey et al., 2019). Results: Our previous results were not replicated, with no difference between responders and nonresponders in theta connectivity (p = 0.250, Cohen's d = 0.1786) nor alpha power (p = 0.357, eta(2)(p) = 0.005). Conclusions: These results suggest that baseline resting EEG theta connectivity or alpha power are unlikely to be generalisable predictors of response to rTMS treatment for depression. Significance: These results highlight the importance of independent replication, data sharing and using large datasets in the prediction of response research.

Methods: Several types of ML models were trained with twelve quantitative features derived from EEG-R and EEG background data of 134 adult CA patients. Poor outcome was a Cerebral Performance Category score of 3-5 within 6 months. Results: The Random Forest (RF) trained on EEG-R showed the highest AUC of 83% (95-CI 80-86) of tested ML classifiers, predicting poor outcome with 46% sensitivity (95%-CI 40-51) and 89% specificity (95%-CI 86-92). Visual analysis of EEG-R had 80% sensitivity and 65% specificity. The RF was also the best classifier for EEG background (AUC 85%, 95%-CI 83-88) at 24 h after CA, with 62% sensitivity (95%-CI 57-67) and 84% specificity (95%-CI 79-88). Combining EEG-R and EEG background RF classifiers reduced the number of false positives. Conclusions: Quantitative EEG-R using ML predicts poor outcome with higher specificity, but lower sensitivity compared to visual analysis of EEG-R, and is of some additional value to ML on EEG background data. Significance: Quantitative EEG-R using ML is a promising alternative to visual analysis and of some added value to ML on EEG background data.

With the development of neural networks for machine learning tools, the Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based classification of human emotions is increasingly important in providing health-care for Edge Computing in support of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, classifying emotions through EEG signals is very challenging due to the low temporal boundaries and non-linear nature of EEG signals. Regarding non-linearity, we propose a hierarchical Semi-skipping Layered Gated Unit (SLGU) besides Efficient Network (ENet) for feature extraction. For faster processing, we have introduced a semi-skipping layer for Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The entered layer automatically skips the divergent factor during network training. Preprocessed EEG signals are sent to the hybrid SLGU-ENet model for deep feature extraction. To overcome the computational cost, an optimal function reduction method called the Bag of Visualized Characteristics (BoVC) is used. The entire facility is verified against two publicly available datasets. The results show that the classification performance of the proposed model achieves superior classification precision in a short processing time compared to the state-of-the-art models. The proposed algorithm required around 1.2-5 seconds, suitable for real-time IoT applications.

The novel RDCSAE structure is designed to extract the most discriminative unsupervised features from EEG signals and fed into the proposed supervised IKRVFLN classifier to train efficiently by reducing the mean-square error cost function for recognizing the epileptic seizure activity with promising accuracy. The proposed RDCSAE-IKRVFLN algorithm is tested over the benchmark Boston Children's Hospital multichannel scalp EEG (sEEG) and Boon University, Germany single-channel EEG databases. The less computational complexity, higher learning speed, better model generalization, accurate epileptic seizure recognition, remarkable classification accuracy, negligible false positive rate per hour (FPR/h) and short event recognition time are the main advantages of the proposed RDCSAE-IKRVFLN method over reduced deep convolutional neural network (RDCNN), RDCSAE and RDCSAE-KRVFLN methods. The proposed RDCSAE-IKRVFLN method is implemented in a high-speed reconfigurable field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware environment to design a computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) system for automatic epileptic seizure diagnosis. The simplicity, feasibility, and practicability of the proposed method validate the stable and reliable performances of epilepsy detection and recognition.

Thus, EEG was introduced here to study the method of automobile sound recognition in view of frequency bands and channels. An EEG acquisition instrument was utilized to simultaneously acquire the EEGs of subjects stimulated by engine, exhaust and in-car sounds, and the power spectra of EEG were extracted by means of Welch Algorithm to construct a feature matrix; Then, the accuracies of automobile sound recognition based on five machine learning models were compared to determine the optimal model and the best frequency band range; What' more, considering the differences between subjects, the m-ReliefF algorithm was applied here to investigate the universality channel with the optimal weight. Our results indicated that the differences between the three kinds of automobile sounds can be effectively identified by means of the KNN model, whose mean of accuracy peaks up to 87.93%; In addition, the recognition accuracies of beta and gamma bands were far higher than that of alpha and theta bands. Also, the accuracies of top universality 9 and 12 channels were up to 89.9% and 92.8% respectively, which were even better than that of the original 63 channels. This study revealed that recognition accuracy and computational efficiency can be significantly improved through the precise localization of the frequency bands and channels related with the automobile sounds, and demonstrated that EEG-based evaluation of the automobile sound quality shall be feasible.

J	Singh, K; Malhotra, J				Singh, Kuldeep; Malhotra, Jyoteesh			Cloud based ensemble machine learning approach for smart detection of epileptic seizures using higher order spectral analysis	PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Cloud computing; Epilepsy; Ensemble machine learning; EEG; Internet of Things; Healthcare	IOT	The present paper proposes a smart framework for detection of epileptic seizures using the concepts of IoT technologies, cloud computing and machine learning. This framework processes the acquired scalp EEG signals by Fast Walsh Hadamard transform. Then, the transformed frequency-domain signals are examined using higher-order spectral analysis to extract amplitude and entropy-based statistical features. The extracted features have been selected by means of correlation-based feature selection algorithm to achieve more real-time classification with reduced complexity and delay. Finally, the samples containing selected features have been fed to ensemble machine learning techniques for classification into several classes of EEG states, viz. normal, interictal and ictal. The employed techniques include Dagging, Bagging, Stacking, MultiBoost AB and AdaBoost M1 algorithms in integration with C4.5 decision tree algorithm as the base classifier. The results of the ensemble techniques are also compared with standalone C4.5 decision tree and SVM algorithms. The performance analysis through simulation results reveals that the ensemble of AdaBoost M1 and C4.5 decision tree algorithms with higher-order spectral features is an adequate technique for automated detection of epileptic seizures in real-time. This technique achieves 100% classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values with optimally small classification time.

Early prognosis is currently based on cranial ultrasound (CUS), MRI, EEG, NIRS, and/or general movements assessed at specific ages, and predicting outcome in an individual (precision medicine) is not yet possible. New algorithms based on large databases and machine learning applied to clinical, neuromonitoring, and neuroimaging data and genetic analysis and assays measuring multiple biomarkers (omics) can fulfill the needs of modern neonatology. A synergy of all these techniques and the use of automatic quantitative analysis might give clinicians the possibility to provide patient-targeted decision-making for individualized diagnosis, therapy, and outcome prediction. This review will first focus on common neonatal neurological diseases, associated risk factors, and most common treatments. After that, we will discuss how precision medicine and machine learning (ML) approaches could change the future of prediction and prognosis in this field.

J	Chen, BQ; Zheng, BX; Wang, CQ; Sun, WF				Chen, Bin-qiang; Zheng, Bai-xun; Wang, Chu-qiao; Sun, Wei-fang			Adaptive Sparse Detector for Suppressing Powerline Component in EEG Measurements	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						EEG; spare representation; fourier transform; powerline interference; basis pursuit	CLASSIFICATION	Powerline interference (PLI) is a major source of interference in the acquisition of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Digital notch filters (DNFs) have been widely used to remove the PLI such that actual features, which are weak in energy and strongly connected to brain states, can be extracted explicitly. However, DNFs are mathematically implemented via discrete Fourier analysis, the problem of overlapping between spectral counterparts of PLI and those of EEG features is inevitable. In spite of their effectiveness, DNFs usually cause distortions on the extracted EEG features, which may lead to incorrect diagnostic results. To address this problem, we investigate an adaptive sparse detector for reducing PLI. This novel approach is proposed based on sparse representation inspired by self-adaptive machine learning. In the coding phase, an overcomplete dictionary, which consists of redundant harmonic waves with equally spaced frequencies, is employed to represent the corrupted EEG signal. A strategy based on the split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm is employed to optimize the associated representation coefficients. It is verified that spectral components related to PLI are compressed into a narrow area in the frequency domain, thus reducing overlapping with features of interest. In the decoding phase, eliminating of coefficients within the narrow band area can remove the PLI from the reconstructed signal. The sparsity of the signal in the dictionary domain is determined by the redundancy factor. A selection criteria of the redundancy factor is suggested via numerical simulations. Experiments have shown the proposed approach can ensure less distortions on actual EEG features.

Seizure Forecasting Using a Novel Sub-Scalp Ultra-Long Term EEG Monitoring System	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						seizure; seizure cycles; seizure forecasting; epilepsy; implantable device; sub scalp	EPILEPSY; PATIENT	Accurate identification of seizure activity, both clinical and subclinical, has important implications in the management of epilepsy. Accurate recognition of seizure activity is essential for diagnostic, management and forecasting purposes, but patient-reported seizures have been shown to be unreliable. Earlier work has revealed accurate capture of electrographic seizures and forecasting is possible with an implantable intracranial device, but less invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recording systems would be optimal. Here, we present preliminary results of seizure detection and forecasting with a minimally invasive sub-scalp device that continuously records EEG. Five participants with refractory epilepsy who experience at least two clinically identifiable seizures monthly have been implanted with sub-scalp devices (Minder (R)), providing two channels of data from both hemispheres of the brain. Data is continuously captured via a behind-the-ear system, which also powers the device, and transferred wirelessly to a mobile phone, from where it is accessible remotely via cloud storage. EEG recordings from the sub-scalp device were compared to data recorded from a conventional system during a 1-week ambulatory video-EEG monitoring session. Suspect epileptiform activity (EA) was detected using machine learning algorithms and reviewed by trained neurophysiologists. Seizure forecasting was demonstrated retrospectively by utilizing cycles in EA and previous seizure times. The procedures and devices were well-tolerated and no significant complications have been reported. Seizures were accurately identified on the sub-scalp system, as visually confirmed by periods of concurrent conventional scalp EEG recordings. The data acquired also allowed seizure forecasting to be successfully undertaken. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC score) achieved (0.88), which is comparable to the best score in recent, state-of-the-art forecasting work using intracranial EEG.

This study aims to compare the power amplitude of electrodes covering the central and frontal regions of a 32-channel scalp EEG. The activations from a standard index finger-tapping and a game paradigm are analyzed. Twenty-five right-handed and five left-handed healthy subjects (range = 18-30 years; mean = 24.25 years; SD = 3.96 years) participated in this study. A novel single-frequency filter (SFF) bank was applied to identify the peak amplitude from the power spectral density plots. The results show that the gaming paradigm yields lower or comparable power amplitudes than the standard finger tapping. We observed that the right-hand finger tapping by the left-handed subjects shows lower between-subject dispersion in amplitude. Nonparametric Spearman correlation showed no association between game scores and power amplitude for the right-handed participants. However, for left-handers, both positive and negative associations were observed. This study demonstrates the efficacy of SFF for extracting power amplitudes with a better signalto-noise ratio, which has implications in BCI and motor rehabilitation applications. The findings support the role of game paradigms for motor movement research and in understanding bilateral hemispheric activations in cognitive tasks.

In particular, investigation of P300 brainwaves is relevant due to its ease of use in the context of BCI. Though high-accuracy models have been developed for individual subjects under laboratory controlled conditions, further work is required to improve the robustness of the models especially for more varied conditions. Here we propose an adaptive chirplet transform (ACT) algorithm coupled with an artificial neural network for robust P300 classification. Comparison of the proposed method with conventional downsampling methods for feature extraction showed an black80% and 73% accuracy respectively when a neural network model was fit to a collection of 16 subject's P300 data. Meanwhile, accuracies of up to 100% could be achieved when the model was trained and validated on subject-specific datasets with the same averaging techniques. This investigation makes it clear that the adaptive chirplet transform holds promise for addressing issues of reliability and robustness in P300 BCI and other related brain signal processing tasks.

CNN based classification of motor imaginary using variational mode decomposed EEG-spectrum image	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING LETTERS			English	Article							CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BCI; DATASET	A novel approach of preprocessing EEG signals by generating spectrum image for effective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification for Motor Imaginary (MI) recognition is proposed. The approach involves extracting the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) modes of EEG signals, from which the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of all the modes are arranged to form EEG spectrum images. The EEG spectrum images generated are provided as input image to CNN. The two generic CNN architectures for MI classification (EEGNet and DeepConvNet) and the architectures for pattern recognition (AlexNet and LeNet) are used in this study. Among the four architectures, EEGNet provides average accuracies of 91.37%, 94.41%, 85.67% and 90.21% for the four datasets used to validate the proposed approach. Consistently better results in comparison with results in recent literature demonstrate that the EEG spectrum image generation using VMD-STFT is a promising method for the time frequency analysis of EEG signals.

Chronic Study on Brainwave Authentication in a Real-Life Setting: An LSTM-Based Bagging Approach	BIOSENSORS-BASEL			English	Article						EEG-based authentication; multitask authentication; real-world setting; EEG headset	IDENTIFICATION	With the advent of the digital age, concern about how to secure authorized access to sensitive data is increasing. Besides traditional authentication methods, there is an interest in biometric traits such as fingerprints, the iris, facial characteristics, and, recently, brainwaves, primarily based on electroencephalography (EEG). Current work on EEG-based authentication focuses on acute recordings in laboratory settings using high-end equipment, typically equipped with 64 channels and operating at a high sampling rate. In this work, we validated the feasibility of EEG-based authentication in a real-world, out-of-laboratory setting using a commercial dry-electrode EEG headset and chronic recordings on a population of 15 healthy people. We used an LSTM-based network with bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to decode our recordings in response to a multitask scheme consisting of performed and imagined motor tasks, and showed that it improved the performance of the standard LSTM approach. We achieved an authentication accuracy, false acceptance rate (FAR), and false rejection rate (FRR) of 92.6%, 2.5%, and 5.0% for the performed motor task; 92.5%, 2.6%, and 4.9% for the imagined motor task; and 93.0%, 1.9%, and 5.1% for the combined tasks, respectively. We recommend the proposed method for time- and data-limited scenarios.

This study combined multimodal (neurophysiology and psychometrics) signatures to classify the training dataset and predict the testing dataset on individual heat pain sensitivity. Methods: Healthy individuals were recruited in this study. Individual heat pain sensitivity and psychometric scores, as well as the resting-state elec- troencephalography (EEG) data, were obtained from each participant. Participants were divided into low-sensitivity and high-sensitivity subgroups according to their heat pain sensitivity. Psychometric data obtained from psychometric measurements and power spectral density (PSD) and functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state EEG analysis were subjected to feature selection with an independent t test and were then trained and predicted using machine learning models, including support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor. Results: In total, 85 participants were recruited in this study, and their data were divided into training (n = 65) and testing (n = 20) datasets. We identified the resting-state PSD and FC, which can serve as brain signatures to classify heat pain as high-sensitive or low-sensitive. Using machine learning algorithms of SVM with different kernels, we obtained an accuracy of 86.2%-93.8% in classifying the participants into thermal pain high-sensitivity and low-sensitivity groups; moreover, using the trained model of cubic SVM, an accuracy of 80% was achieved in predicting the pain sensitivity of an independent dataset of combined PSD and FC features of resting-state EEG data. Conclusion: Acceptable accuracy in classification and prediction by using the SVM model indicated that pain sensitivity could be achieved, leading to considerable possibilities of the use of objective evaluation of pain perception in clinical practice. However, the predictive model presented in this study requires further validation by studies with a larger dataset.

Eye-blink artifact removal from single channel EEG with k-means and SSA	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; SIGNALS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CLASSIFICATION; SEPARATION	In recent years, the usage of portable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices are becoming popular for both clinical and non-clinical applications. In order to provide more comfort to the subject and measure the EEG signals for several hours, these devices usually consists of fewer EEG channels or even with a single EEG channel. However, electrooculogram (EOG) signal, also known as eye-blink artifact, produced by involuntary movement of eyelids, always contaminate the EEG signals. Very few techniques are available to remove these artifacts from single channel EEG and most of these techniques modify the uncontaminated regions of the EEG signal. In this paper, we developed a new framework that combines unsupervised machine learning algorithm (k-means) and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique to remove eye blink artifact without modifying actual EEG signal. The novelty of the work lies in the extraction of the eye-blink artifact based on the time-domain features of the EEG signal and the unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The extracted eye-blink artifact is further processed by the SSA method and finally subtracted from the contaminated single channel EEG signal to obtain the corrected EEG signal. Results with synthetic and real EEG signals demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing methods. Moreover, the frequency based measures [the power spectrum ratio (Gamma) and the mean absolute error (MAE)] also show that the proposed method does not modify the uncontaminated regions of the EEG signal while removing the eye-blink artifact.

Affected people frequently feel pain during activity; however, pain is subjective and difficult to judge objectively, particularly during activity. Here, we developed a system to objectively judge pain levels in walking subjects by recording their quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and analyzing data by machine learning. To do so, we enrolled 23 patients who had undergone total hip replacement for pain, and recorded their qEEG during a five-minute walk via a wearable device with a single electrode placed over the Fp1 region, based on the 10-20 Electrode Placement System, before and three months after surgery. We also assessed subject hip pain using a numerical rating scale. Brain wave amplitude differed significantly among subjects with different levels of hip pain at frequencies ranging from 1 to 35 Hz. qEEG data were also analyzed by a support vector machine using the Radial Basis Functional Kernel, a function used in machine learning. That approach showed that an individual's hip pain during walking can be recognized and subdivided into pain quartiles with 79.6% recognition Accuracy. Overall, we have devised an objective and non-invasive tool to monitor an individual's pain during walking.

The decoded MI movement intent often serve as potential control input for brain-computer interface (BCI) based rehabilitation robots. However, the presence of multiple dynamic artifacts in EEG signal leads to serious processing challenge that affects the BCI system in practical settings. Hence, this study propose a hybrid approach based on Low-rank spatiotemporal filtering technique for concurrent elimination of multiple EEG artifacts. Afterwards, a convolutional neural network based deep learning model (ConvNet-DL) that extracts neural information from the cleaned EEG signal for MI tasks decoding was built. The proposed method was studied in comparison with existing artifact removal methods using EEG signals of transhumeral amputees who performed five different MI tasks. Remarkably, the proposed method led to significant improvements in MI task decoding accuracy for the ConvNet-DL model in the range of 8.00 similar to 13.98%, while up to 14.38% increment was recorded in terms of the MCC: Mathew correlation coefficients at p<0.05. Also, a signal to error ratio of more than 11 dB was recorded by the proposed method.

We induced two different levels of vigilance state; vigilance decrement (VD) and vigilance enhancement (VE). The VD state was induced by performing a modified version of the Stroop Color-Word Task (SCWT) for approximately 45 minutes. Likewise, the VE state was induced by incorporating audio stimulation of 250 Hz into the SCWT for 45 minutes. We assessed the levels of vigilance on 20 healthy subjects by utilizing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and machine learning. The EEG signals were analyzed using four types of entropies; Approximate Entropy (AE), Sample Entropy (SE), Fuzzy Entropy (FE), and Differential Entropy (DE). We then quantified vigilance levels using statistical analysis and support vector machines (SVM) classifier. We found that the proposed VE method has significantly reduced the reaction time (RT) by 44% and improved the accuracy of target detection by 25%, (p < 0.001) compared to VD state. Besides, we found that 30 min of audio stimulation has reduced the RT by 32% from the beginning to the end of VE phase of the experiment. The entropy measures show that the temporal profile of the EEG signals has significantly increased with VE. The classification results showed that SVM technique with DE features across all frequency bands can detect VE levels with accuracy varying between (92.10 +/- 02.24)% to (98.32 +/- 01.14)%, sensitivity of (92.50 +/- 02.33)% to (98.66 +/- 01.00)%, and specificity of (91.70 +/- 02.32)% to (97.99 +/- 01.05)%. Results also showed that the classification performance using DE has outperformed the other entropy measures by an average of +8.07%. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 250 Hz audio stimulation method in improving vigilance level and suggest using it for future cognitive enhancement studies.

The EEG-based BCI applications are majorly limited by the time-consuming calibration procedure for discriminative feature representation and classification. Existing EEG classification methods either heavily depend on the handcrafted features or require adequate annotated samples at each session for calibration. To address these issues, we propose a novel dynamic joint domain adaptation network based on adversarial learning strategy to learn domain-invariant feature representation, and thus improve EEG classification performance in the target domain by leveraging useful information from the source session. Specifically, we explore the global discriminator to align the marginal distribution across domains, and the local discriminator to reduce the conditional distribution discrepancy between sub-domains via conditioning on deep representation as well as the predicted labels from the classifier. In addition, we further investigate a dynamic adversarial factor to adaptively estimate the relative importance of alignment between the marginal and conditional distributions. To evaluate the efficacy of our method, extensive experiments are conducted on two public EEG datasets, namely, Datasets IIa and IIb of BCI Competition IV. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

However, extracting EEG features which are consistent in indicating MWL across different tasks is still one of the critical challenges. This study attempts to compare the cross-task consistency in indexing MWL variations between two commonly used EEG-based MWL indicators, power spectral density (PSD) of ongoing EEG and task-irrelevant auditory ERPs (tir-aERPs). The verbal N-back and the multi-attribute task battery (MATB), both with two difficulty levels, were employed in the experiment, along with task-irrelevant auditory probes. EEG was recorded from 17 subjects when they were performing the tasks. The tir-aERPs elicited by the auditory probes and the relative PSDs of ongoing EEG between two consecutive auditory probes were extracted and statistically analyzed to reveal the effects of MWL and task type. Discriminant analysis and support vector machine were employed to examine the generalization of tir-aERP and PSD features in indexing MWL variations across different tasks. The results showed that the amplitudes of tir-aERP components, N1, early P3a, late P3a, and the reorienting negativity, significantly decreased with the increasing MWL in both N-back and MATB. Task type had no obvious influence on the amplitudes and topological layout of the MWL-sensitive tir-aERP features. The relative PSDs in theta, alpha, and low beta bands were also sensitive to MWL variations. However, the MWL-sensitive PSD features and their topological patterns were significantly affected by task type. The cross-task classification results based on tir-aERP features also significantly outperformed the PSD features. These results suggest that the tir-aERPs should be potentially more consistent MWL indicators across very different task types when compared to PSD. The current study may provide new insights to our understanding of the common and distinctive neuropsychological essences of MWL across different tasks.

Numerous studies and applications have developed, because of the researchers' interest in systems in recent years. The capacity to categorize electroencephalograms is essential for building effective brain-computer interfaces. In this paper, three experiments were performed in order to categorize the brain signals with the goal of improving a model for EEG data analysis. An investigation is carried out to detect the characteristics derived from interactions across channels that may be more accurate than features that could be taken from individuals. Many machine learning techniques were applied such as; K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term memory and Decision Tree in this paper in order to detect and analyze the EEG signals from three different datasets to determine the best accuracy results using the particle swarm optimization algorithm that obviously minimized the dimension of the feature vector and improved the accuracy results.

In the past three decades, it has attracted the interest of researchers and gradually become a research hotspot. As a typical BCI application, the brain-controlled wheelchair (BCW) could provide a new communicating channel with the external environment for physically disabled people. However, the main challenge of BCW is how to decode multi-degree of freedom control instruction from electroencephalogram (EEG) as soon as possible. The research progress of BCW has been developed rapidly over the past fifteen years. In this review, we investigate the BCW from multiple perspectives, include the type of signal acquisition, the pattern of commands for the control system and the working mechanism of the control system. Furthermore, we summarize the development trend of BCW based on the previous investigation, and it is mainly manifested in three aspects: from a wet electrode to dry electrode, from single-mode to multi-mode, and from synchronous control to asynchronous control. With the continuous development of BCW, we also find new functions have been introduced into BCW to increase its stability and robustness. It is believed that BCW will be able to enter the real-life from the laboratory and will be widely used in rehabilitation medicine in the future.

Brandon			Automated Annotation of Epileptiform Burden and Its Association with Outcomes	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CONTINUOUS ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PERIODIC DISCHARGES; SEIZURE BURDEN; EEG; GUIDELINES; STATEMENT	Objective This study was undertaken to determine the dose-response relation between epileptiform activity burden and outcomes in acutely ill patients. Methods A single center retrospective analysis was made of 1,967 neurologic, medical, and surgical patients who underwent >16 hours of continuous electroencephalography (EEG) between 2011 and 2017. We developed an artificial intelligence algorithm to annotate 11.02 terabytes of EEG and quantify epileptiform activity burden within 72 hours of recording. We evaluated burden (1) in the first 24 hours of recording, (2) in the 12-hours epoch with highest burden (peak burden), and (3) cumulatively through the first 72 hours of monitoring. Machine learning was applied to estimate the effect of epileptiform burden on outcome. Outcome measure was discharge modified Rankin Scale, dichotomized as good (0-4) versus poor (5-6). Results Peak epileptiform burden was independently associated with poor outcomes (p < 0.0001). Other independent associations included age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, seizure on presentation, and diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Model calibration error was calculated across 3 strata based on the time interval between last EEG measurement (up to 72 hours of monitoring) and discharge: (1) <5 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0941 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.0706-0.1191); 5 to 10 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0946 (95% CI = 0.0631-0.1290); >10 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0998 (95% CI = 0.0698-0.1335). After adjusting for covariates, increase in peak epileptiform activity burden from 0 to 100% increased the probability of poor outcome by 35%. Interpretation Automated measurement of peak epileptiform activity burden affords a convenient, consistent, and quantifiable target for future multicenter randomized trials investigating whether suppressing epileptiform activity improves outcomes.

The less obtrusive, minimized systems (e.g., single-channel EEG, no ECG reference) have the drawback of artifact contamination with varying intensity that are particularly difficult to identify and remove. We developed brMEGA, the first open-source algorithm for automated detection and removal of cardiogenic artifacts using non-linear time-frequency analysis and machine learning to (1) detect whether and where cardiogenic artifacts exist, and (2) remove those artifacts. We compare our algorithm against visual artifact identification and a previously established approach and validate it in one real and semi-real datasets. We demonstrated that brMEGA successfully identifies and substantially removes cardiogenic artifacts in singlechannel EEG recordings. Moreover, recovery of cardiogenic artifacts, if present, gives the opportunity for future extraction of heart rate features without ECG measurement.

Therefore, emotion recognition is of great significance for HilCPS. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain abundant and useful information, and can objectively reflect human emotional states. According to EEG signals, using machine learning to recognize emotion is the main method at present. This method depends on the quantity and quality of samples as well as the capability of classification model. However, the quantity of EEG samples is often insufficient and the quality of EEG samples is often irregular. Meanwhile, EEG samples possess strong nonlinearity. Therefore, an EEG emotion recognition method based on transfer learning (TL) and echo state network (ESN) for HilCPS is proposed in this paper. First, a selection algorithm of EEG samples based on average Frechet distance is proposed to improve the sample quality. Second, a feature transfer algorithm of EEG samples based on transfer component analysis is proposed to expand the sample quantity. Third, in order to solve the problem of the nonlinearity of EEG samples, a classification model of EEG samples based on ESN is constructed to accurately classify emotional states. Finally, experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, the proposed method can expand the quantity of the high-quality EEG samples and effectively improve the accuracy of emotion recognition.

The most common way to detect seizures automatically is to use an electroencephalogram (EEG). In this study, sliding discrete Fourier transform (SDFT) is applied for conversion to a frequency domain by using a simple IIR structure with other fourteen features extracted from the EEG database of Bonn University. These fifteen features used as input to classifier for seizure detection, a two-classifier feedforward neural network (FFNN) and an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) used. The results appear that the highest accuracy is 99.74% with FFNN and 99.67 ANFIS. Also, when measuring the feature importance in classification for each feature extraction method and compare the results, the SDFT has more importance than other features used in this study for the classification.

Methods: EEG signals were converted to spectrograms and served as input to train DCNNs using the transfer learning technique. We also modified and applied a data augmentation method, SpecAugment, generally employed for speech recognition. Furthermore, for comparison purposes, we classified the SSVEP dataset using support-vector machines (SVMs) and filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA). Results: Excluding the evaluated user's data from the fine-tuning process, we reached 82.2% mean test accuracy and 0.825 mean F1-Score on 35 subjects from an open dataset, using a small data length (0.5 s), only one electrode (Oz) and the DCNN with transfer learning, window slicing (WS) and SpecAugment's time masks. Conclusion: The DCNN results surpassed SVM and FBCCA performances, using a single electrode and a small data length. Transfer learning provided minimal accuracy change, but made training faster. SpecAugment created a small performance improvement and was successfully combined with WS, yielding higher accuracies. Significance: We present a new methodology to solve the problem of SSVEP classification using DCNNs. We also modified a speech recognition data augmentation technique and applied it to the context of BCIs. The presented methodology surpassed performances obtained with FBCCA and SVMs (more traditional SSVEP classification methods) in BCIs with small data lengths and one electrode. This type of BCI can be used to develop small and fast systems.	[Bassi, Pedro R. A.

Artificial data generation in various applications can be used to handle these challenges. This article proposes a guided evolutionary synthesizer (GES), a tool derived from principles of genetic algorithm, and designed to generate artificial healthcare time series data for improving classification performance of machine learning models. We conducted a series of promising and confirmatory preliminary experiments performance using traditional machine learning and nonresidual convolutional neural network models to evaluate the effectiveness of GES synthetic on data classification. Motivated by the preliminary results, we conducted eight detailed experiments using residual neural network (ResNet), which demonstrated the flexibility of GES and the effectiveness of GES synthetic data in improving the classification performance of deep neural networks. These experiments use GES generated electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets. Our findings show that models trained with GES synthetic data performed better than models trained with regular perturbed data, had better diagnostic performance for both EEG and ECG datasets, achieved better performance with lower training volume for EEG dataset, eased learning biases seen in the literature for ECG normal sinus and premature ventricular complex rhythms, and had better classification outcomes than comparable related work models trained with similar ECG classes.

We introduce an automated Bayesian inference framework, called AutoBayes, that explores different graphical models linking classifier, encoder, decoder, estimator and adversarial network blocks to optimize nuisance-invariant machine learning pipelines. Auto Bayes also enables learning disentangled representations, where the latent variable is split into multiple pieces to impose various relationships with the nuisance variation and task labels. We benchmark the framework on several public datasets, and provide analysis of its capability for subject-transfer learning with/without variational modeling and adversarial training. We demonstrate a significant performance improvement with ensemble learning across explored graphical models.

Generalized neural decoders for transfer learning across participants and recording modalities	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural decoding; deep learning; spectral power; transfer learning		Objective. Advances in neural decoding have enabled brain-computer interfaces to perform increasingly complex and clinically-relevant tasks. However, such decoders are often tailored to specific participants, days, and recording sites, limiting their practical long-term usage. Therefore, a fundamental challenge is to develop neural decoders that can robustly train on pooled, multi-participant data and generalize to new participants. Approach. We introduce a new decoder, HTNet, which uses a convolutional neural network with two innovations: (a) a Hilbert transform that computes spectral power at data-driven frequencies and (b) a layer that projects electrode-level data onto predefined brain regions. The projection layer critically enables applications with intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG), where electrode locations are not standardized and vary widely across participants. We trained HTNet to decode arm movements using pooled ECoG data from 11 of 12 participants and tested performance on unseen ECoG or electroencephalography (EEG) participants; these pretrained models were also subsequently fine-tuned to each test participant. Main results. HTNet outperformed state-of-the-art decoders when tested on unseen participants, even when a different recording modality was used. By fine-tuning these generalized HTNet decoders, we achieved performance approaching the best tailored decoders with as few as 50 ECoG or 20 EEG events. We were also able to interpret HTNet's trained weights and demonstrate its ability to extract physiologically-relevant features. Significance. By generalizing to new participants and recording modalities, robustly handling variations in electrode placement, and allowing participant-specific fine-tuning with minimal data, HTNet is applicable across a broader range of neural decoding applications compared to current state-of-the-art decoders.

For the safety of patients with epilepsy, an automatic seizure detection algorithm for continuous seizure monitoring in daily life is important to reduce risks related to seizures, including sudden unexpected death. Previous researchers applied machine learning to detect seizures with EEG, but the epileptic EEG waveform contains subtle changes that are difficult to identify. Furthermore, the imbalance problem due to the small proportion of ictal events caused poor prediction performance in supervised learning approaches. This study aimed to present a personalized deep learning-based anomaly detection algorithm for seizure monitoring with behind-the-ear electroen-cephalogram (EEG) signals. Methods: We collected behind-the-ear EEG signals from 16 patients with epilepsy in the hospital and used them to develop and evaluate seizure detection algorithms. We modified the variational autoencoder network to learn the latent representation of normal EEG signals and performed seizure detection by measuring the anomalies in EEG signals using the trained network. To personalize the algorithm, we also proposed a method to calibrate the anomaly score for each patient by comparing the representations in the latent space. Results: Our proposed algorithm showed a sensitivity of 90.4% with a false alarm rate of 0.83 per hour without personal calibration. On the other hand, the one-class support vector machine only showed a sensitivity of 84.6% with a false alarm rate of 2.17 per hour. Furthermore, our proposed model with per-sonal calibration achieved 94.2% sensitivity with a false alarm rate of 0.29 while detecting 49 of 52 ictal events. Conclusions: We proposed a novel seizure detection algorithm with behind-the-ear EEG signals via semi-supervised learning of an anomaly detecting variational autoencoder and personalization method of anomaly scoring by comparing latent representations. Our approach achieved improved seizure detec-tion with high sensitivity and a lower false alarm rate. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is thus crucial to develop automated models for the detection of abnormalities in EEGs related to epilepsy. This paper describes the development of a novel class of compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting abnormal patterns and electrodes in EEGs for epilepsy. The designed model is inspired by a CNN developed for brain-computer interfacing called multichannel EEGNet (mEEGNet). Unlike the EEGNet, the proposed model, mEEGNet, has the same number of electrode inputs and outputs to detect abnormal patterns. The mEEGNet was evaluated with a clinical dataset consisting of 29 cases of juvenile and childhood absence epilepsy labeled by a clinical expert. The labels were given to paroxysmal discharges visually observed in both ictal (seizure) and interictal (nonseizure) durations. Results showed that the mEEGNet detected abnormalities with the area under the curve, F1-values, and sensitivity equivalent to or higher than those of existing CNNs. Moreover, the number of parameters is much smaller than other CNN models. To our knowledge, the dataset of absence epilepsy validated with machine learning through this research is the largest in the literature.

However, effective and objective bedside evaluation is a challenging problem. In this study, we explored electroencephalography (EEG) response tracking sound rhythms as potential neural markers for DOC evaluation. We analyzed the responses to natural speech and tones modulated at 2 and 41 Hz. At the population level, patients with positive outcomes (DOC-P) showed higher cortical synchronization to modulated tones at 41 Hz compared with patients with negative outcomes (DOC-N). At the individual level, phase coherence to modulated tones at 41 Hz was significantly correlated with Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E) scores. Furthermore, SVM classifiers, trained using phase coherences in higher frequency bands or combination of the low frequency aSSR and speech tracking responses, performed very well in diagnosis and prognosis of DOC. These findings show that EEG response to auditory rhythms is a potential tool for diagnosis, severity, and prognosis of DOC.

One such additional operation is figure-ground segmentation, extracting the relevant features and locations of the target object while ignoring irrelevant features. In this study of 60 human participants (female and male), we show objects on backgrounds of increasing complexity to investigate whether recurrent computations are increasingly important for segmenting objects from more complex backgrounds. Three lines of evidence show that recurrent processing is critical for recognition of objects embedded in complex scenes. First, behavioral results indicated a greater reduction in performance after masking objects presented on more complex backgrounds, with the degree of impairment increasing with increasing background complexity. Second, electroencephalography (EEG) measurements showed clear differences in the evoked response potentials between conditions around time points beyond feedforward activity, and exploratory object decoding analyses based on the EEG signal indicated later decoding onsets for objects embedded in more complex backgrounds. Third, deep convolutional neural network performance confirmed this interpretation. Feedforward and less deep networks showed a higher degree of impairment in recognition for objects in complex backgrounds compared with recurrent and deeper networks. Together, these results support the notion that recurrent computations drive figure-ground segmentation of objects in complex scenes.

J	Gao, M; Liu, RM; Mao, J				Gao, Ming; Liu, Runmin; Mao, Jie			Noise Robustness Low-Rank Learning Algorithm for Electroencephalogram Signal Classification	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram; epilepsy; noise robustness; low-rank learning; pinball loss function	LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; EEG SIGNALS	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is often used in clinical epilepsy treatment to monitor electrical signal changes in the brain of patients with epilepsy. With the development of signal processing and artificial intelligence technology, artificial intelligence classification method plays an important role in the automatic recognition of epilepsy EEG signals. However, traditional classifiers are easily affected by impurities and noise in epileptic EEG signals. To solve this problem, this paper develops a noise robustness low-rank learning (NRLRL) algorithm for EEG signal classification. NRLRL establishes a low-rank subspace to connect the original data space and label space. Making full use of supervision information, it considers the local information preservation of samples to ensure the low-rank representation of within-class compactness and between-classes dispersion. The asymmetric least squares support vector machine (aLS-SVM) is embedded into the objective function of NRLRL. The aLS-SVM finds the maximum quantile distance between the two classes of samples based on the pinball loss function, which further improves the noise robustness of the model. Several classification experiments with different noise intensity are designed on the Bonn data set, and the experiment results verify the effectiveness of the NRLRL algorithm.

Thirty participants were recruited from 14 to 20 years old males from two gaming centers. Twenty healthy participants were gathered from different schools in Tehran using the available sampling method. The QEEG data collection was performed in three states: closed-eye and open-eye states, and during a working memory task. As expected, the power ratios did not show a significant difference between the two groups. Regarding our interest in the complexity of signals, we used the Higuchi algorithm as the feature extractor to provide the input materials for the multilayer perceptron classifier. The results showed that the model had at least a 95% precision rate in classifying the addicts and healthy controls in all three types of tasks. Moreover, significant differences in the Higuchi Fractal Dimension of a few EEG channels have been observed. This study confirms the importance of brain wave complexity in QEEG data analysis and assesses the correlation between EEG-complexity and gaming disorder. Moreover, feature extraction by Higuchi algorithm can render support vector machine classification of the brain waves of addicts and healthy controls more accurate.

A promising approach among privacy-preserving techniques is homomorphic encryption (HE), which allows for computations to be performed on encrypted data. Currently, HE still faces practical limitations related to high computational complexity, noise accumulation, and sole applicability the at bit or small integer values level. We propose herein an encoding method that enables typical HE schemes to operate on real-valued numbers of arbitrary precision and size. The approach is evaluated on two real-world scenarios relying on EEG signals: seizure detection and prediction of predisposition to alcoholism. A supervised machine learning-based approach is formulated, and training is performed using a direct (non-iterative) fitting method that requires a fixed and deterministic number of steps. Experiments on synthetic data of varying size and complexity are performed to determine the impact on runtime and error accumulation. The computational time for training the models increases but remains manageable, while the inference time remains in the order of milliseconds. The prediction performance of the models operating on encoded and encrypted data is comparable to that of standard models operating on plaintext data.

In this paper, we present a novel method for epilepsy detection employing binary and multiclass classifiers. For feature extraction, a total of 105 measurements were extracted from power spectrum, spectrogram, and bispectrogram. For classifier building, widely known machine learning algorithms were used. Our method was applied in a publicly available EEG database. As a result, BP-MLP (backpropagation based on multilayer perceptron) and SMO_Pol (sequential minimal optimization supported by the polynomial kernel) algorithms reached the highest accuracy for binary (100%) and multiclass (98%) classification problems. Subsequently, statistical tests did not find a better performance model. In the evaluation based on confusion matrices, it was also impossible to identify a classifier that stands out concerning other models for EEG classification. In comparison to related words, our predictive models reached competitive results.

J	Anter, AM; Abd Elaziz, M; Zhang, ZG				Anter, Ahmed M.; Abd Elaziz, Mohamed; Zhang, Zhiguo			Real-time epileptic seizure recognition using Bayesian genetic whale optimizer and adaptive machine learning	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Optimization; Electroencephalogram; Extreme learning machine; WOA	SWARM INTELLIGENCE; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; MODEL; IOT	The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been commonly used to identify epileptic seizures, but identifi-cation of seizures from EEG remains a challenging task that requires qualified neurophysiologists. It is important to detect seizures in real time, which can be achieved in an internet of things (IoT)-based cloud platform to alert patients of impending seizures. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new model to recognize seizure states (e.g., ictal, preictal, interictal) from EEG in the IoT framework to monitor patients remotely. The proposed model uses an efficient hybrid genetic whale optimization algorithm (GWOA) based on naive Bayes (NB-GWOA) for feature selection, and an adaptive extreme learning machine (ELM) based on a differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm (DEELM) for classification. In the NB-GWOA method, the genetic algorithm serves to enhance the exploitation of the whale optimization algorithm in the search of the optimal solutions, while the naive Bayes method is used to determine a fitness function to assess every agent in the search space. GWOA has strong robustness and is capable of finding the best solutions in less than five iterations, so it is suitable for selecting discriminative features from a huge number of neurofeatures obtained from EEG. Further, the classification model is constructed based on ELM, which uses the DE algorithm for a fast and efficient learning solution. Results show that the proposed NB-GWOA-DEELM model can avoid over and under-fitting and can provide better and more accurate performance in classifying seizure states from EEG than its competitors.

J	Sutterer, DW; Coia, AJ; Sun, V; Shevell, SK; Awh, E				Sutterer, David W.; Coia, Andrew J.; Sun, Vincent; Shevell, Steven K.; Awh, Edward			Decoding chromaticity and luminance from patterns of EEG activity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						chromaticity; color vision; multivariate pattern analysis; visual evoked potential	VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; COLOR	A long-standing question in the field of vision research is whether scalp-recorded EEG activity contains sufficient information to identify stimulus chromaticity. Recent multivariate work suggests that it is possible to decode which chromaticity an observer is viewing from the multielectrode pattern of EEG activity. There is debate, however, about whether the claimed effects of stimulus chromaticity on visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are instead caused by unequal stimulus luminances, which are achromatic differences. Here, we tested whether stimulus chromaticity could be decoded when potential confounds with luminance were minimized by (1) equating chromatic stimuli in luminance using heterochromatic flicker photometry for each observer and (2) independently varying the chromaticity and luminance of target stimuli, enabling us to test whether the pattern for a given chromaticity generalized across wide variations in luminance. We also tested whether luminance variations can be decoded from the topography of voltage across the scalp. In Experiment 1, we presented two chromaticities (appearing red and green) at three luminance levels during separate trials. In Experiment 2, we presented four chromaticities (appearing red, orange, yellow, and green) at two luminance levels. Using a pattern classifier and the multielectrode pattern of EEG activity, we were able to accurately decode the chromaticity and luminance level of each stimulus. Furthermore, we were able to decode stimulus chromaticity when we trained the classifier on chromaticities presented at one luminance level and tested at a different luminance level. Thus, EEG topography contains robust information regarding stimulus chromaticity, despite large variations in stimulus luminance.

To do so, it can either detect a spontaneous change in the mental state, in the so-called 'active' BCIs, or a transient or sustained change in the brain response to an external stimulation, in 'reactive' BCIs. In the latter, external stimuli are perceived by the user through a sensory channel, usually sight or hearing. When the stimulation is sustained and periodical, the brain response reaches an oscillatory steady-state that can be detected rather easily. We focus our attention on electroencephalography-based BCIs (EEG-based BCI) in which a periodical signal, either mechanical or electrical, stimulates the user skin. This type of stimulus elicits a steady-state response of the somatosensory system that can be detected in the recorded EEG. The oscillatory and phase-locked voltage component characterising this response is called a steady-state somatosensory-evoked potential (SSSEP). It has been shown that the amplitude of the SSSEP is modulated by specific mental tasks, for instance when the user focuses their attention or not to the somatosensory stimulation, allowing the translation of this variation into a command. Actually, SSSEP-based BCIs may benefit from straightforward analysis techniques of EEG signals, like reactive BCIs, while allowing self-paced interaction, like active BCIs. In this paper, we present a survey of scientific literature related to EEG-based BCI exploiting SSSEP. Firstly, we endeavour to describe the main characteristics of SSSEPs and the calibration techniques that allow the tuning of stimulation in order to maximise their amplitude. Secondly, we present the signal processing and data classification algorithms implemented by authors in order to elaborate commands in their SSSEP-based BCIs, as well as the classification performance that they evaluated on user experiments.

However, insufficient high-quality training data are available for building EEG-based emotion recognition models via machine learning or deep learning methods. The artificial generation of high-quality data is an effective approach for overcoming this problem. In this paper, a multi-generator conditional Wasserstein GAN method is proposed for the generation of high-quality artificial that covers a more comprehensive distribution of real data through the use of various generators. Experimental results demonstrate that the artificial data that are generated by the proposed model can effectively improve the performance of emotion classification models that are based on EEG.

It would cause, in a severe case, suicide behaviors. In clinical settings, automatic MDD detection is mainly based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with supervised learning techniques. However, supervised-based MDD detection methods encounter two ineviTable bottlenecks: firstly, such methods rely heavily on an EEG training dataset with MDD labels annotated by a physical therapist, leading to subjectivity and high cost; secondly, most of EEG signals are unlabeled in a real scenario. In this paper, a novel semisupervisedbased MDD detection method named MDD-TSVM is presented. Specifically, the MDD-TSVM utilizes the semisupervised method of transductive support vector machine (TSVM) as its backbone, further dividing the unlabeled penalty item of the TSVM objective function into two pseudo-labeled penalty items with or without MDD. By such improvement, the MDD-SVM can make full use of labeled and unlabeled datasets as well as alleviate the class imbalance problem. Experiment results showed that our proposed MDD-TSVM achieved F1 score of 0.85 +/- 0.05 and accuracy of 0.89 +/- 0.03 on identifying MDD patients, which is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

So that improving the performance of BCI systems can be effective in helping spinal cord injury (SCI) patients to perform daily tasks and rehabilitation work. In contrast, some of the challenges that make this path uneven include low signal-to-noise ratios, various artifacts in EEG signals, Low-performance methods based on handcraft feature extraction, the need for expert people, and differences between different people. However, today the development of deep learning methods and the availability of EEG datasets have reduced the existing limitations. Deep learning frameworks provide an end-to-end approach with the help of various structures that, by extracting automatic features from raw data, they try to reduce the limitation of decoding EEG data and increase the performance of BCI system as much as possible. One of the most practical and effective structures in this field is deep convolutional models. These models learn different features at different scales by taking raw EEG data in various forms at their input without any restrictions. In this paper, we present two deep convolutional models, TSTI-Net and TSI-Net, with the help of designed Inception modules. Taking advantage of the Large and Tiny Inception modules and extracting spatial-temporal features, these two models achieve good results in classifying raw EEG data of spinal cord injury patients. Each of the two models consists of three parts. The first and second parts have the same structure in both models. In these parts, temporal and spatial features are extracted with the help of 2D-temporal and Depthwise convolutions. In the third part, two different Inception modules for each model are used. The two models TSTI-Net and TSI-Net, classify the EEG data of spinal cord injured persons into six classes with 69.29% and 71.45% classification accuracy, respectively. Also, the results expressed for the two proposed models compared to the three famous models EEGNET, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet in the classification of raw EEG data show the good performance of the designed structures TSI-Net and TSTI-Net.

The sleep period could be split into five stages: Wake, REM, N1, N2 and N3. At first, this essay discusses the characteristics of the Sleeping EEG wave briefly. And after the relative powers (the features) of EEG signals are extracted that are obtained by utilizing the pwelch function, the data is re-arranged with features and labels into a table. Then, the linear discrimination analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the dimension of data.

J	King, JR; Wyart, V				King, Jean-Remi; Wyart, Valentin			The Human Brain Encodes a Chronicle of Visual Events at Each Instant of Time Through the Multiplexing of Traveling Waves	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						decoding; dynamical system; EEG; streams; time; visual perception	HIERARCHICAL-MODELS; OBJECT RECOGNITION; WORKING-MEMORY; CORTEX; EEG; INFORMATION; SOFTWARE; DYNAMICS; MEG	The human brain continuously processes streams of visual input. Yet, a single image typically triggers neural responses that extend beyond 1s. To understand how the brain encodes and maintains successive images, we analyzed with electroencephalography the brain activity of human subjects while they watched -5000 visual stimuli presented in fast sequences. First, we confirm that each stimulus can be decoded from brain activity for -1s, and we demonstrate that the brain simultaneously represents multiple images at each time instant. Second, we source localize the corresponding brain responses in the expected visual hierarchy and show that distinct brain regions represent, at each time instant, different snapshots of past stimulations. Third, we propose a simple framework to further characterize the dynamical system of these traveling waves. Our results show that a chain of neural circuits, which each consist of (1) a hidden maintenance mechanism and (2) an observable update mechanism, accounts for the dynamics of macroscopic brain representations elicited by visual sequences. Together, these results detail a simple architecture explaining how successive visual events and their respective timings can be simultaneously represented in the brain.

Finding corresponding countermeasures to decrease traffic accident rates and improve public road safety is critical but challenging. For the purpose of drawing on deep learning (DL) or transfer learning approach to automatically find features in images without hand-crafted feature extraction steps to re-mine the new synchronization and interaction mode between brain regions. In this study, the acquired multi-channel EEG records while performing driving experiments are innovatively converted into a two-dimensional phase coherence matrix (PC image), which is used as an input to a deep learning network (convolutional neural network) to accomplish the combination of deep learning models and functional brain network methods for the detection of UDS. With the motivation of enhancing the classification performance, two approaches, namely the extract image features approach using pre-trained deep learning models (Alexnet and Resnet 18) combined with support vector machine (SVM) and the transfer learning method based on pre-trained networks after fine-tuning are evaluated, respectively. The experimental results indicate that a highest accuracy of 98.44%, highest sensitivity of 100%, highest specificity of 97.02% and highest precision of 96.80% are obtained for the detection of driving-related unfavorable states by using the extract image features approach based on Alexnet network with the 'relu4' layer activation combined with SVM. Additionally, transfer learning method based on Resnet 18 network after fine-tuning with a learning rate of 1e-3 and adam solver achieves an average classification accuracy of 97.90% outperforming other transfer learning methods considered in this work. It can be hence concluded that the innovative combination method of functional brain network and deep learning is effective for unfavorable driving state detection.

However, the existing multi-channel pattern recognition methods require multi-site MMG because it is difficult to extract enough useful features from a single-site MMG. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-channel finger pattern recognition using a single-site MMG signal. First, multi-mode high-dimensional features are extracted from the MMG signals, including statistical features, frequency-domain features, and acoustic features; second, the extracted features are further used for the pattern recognition using artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this study, 14 participants, including 6 males (3 athletes, 3 non-athletes), 6 females (3 athletes, 3 non-athletes) and 2 male amputees (wrist amputation and unilateral transradial) participated in the experiments. The real-time results show that the mean classification accuracy was 95.1 with 2.6 standard deviations (SDs) over the test folds (male athletes), 89.9 88.6 with 3.1, 3.7 SD (male non-athletes and female athletes, respectively) and 77.6 and 74.4 with 9.3 and 11.4 SD, respectively (wrist amputation, unilateral transradial) for seven movements. The results show that the proposed method has the capability to individually control fingers.

The variation exhibited between the brain signals (EEG) of different people makes such signals especially suitable for biometric user identification. However, the characteristics of these signals are also influenced by the user's current condition, including his/her affective state. In this paper, we analyze the significance of the affect-related component of brain signals within the subject identification context. Consistent results are obtained across three different public datasets, suggesting that the dominant component of the signal is subject-related, but the affective state also has a contribution that affects identification accuracy. Results show that identification accuracy increases when the system has been trained with EEG recordings that refer to similar affective states as the sample that is to be identified. This improvement holds independently of the features and classification algorithm used, and it is generally above 10 percent under a rigorous setting, when the training and validation datasets do not share data from the same recording days. This finding emphasizes the potential benefits of considering affective information in applications that require subject identification, such as user authentication.

Using linear modelling, a feature that reflects the f0 of a presented speech stimulus is predicted from neural EEG responses. The correlation between the predicted and the 'actual' f0 feature is a measure for neural response strength. In this study, we aimed to design a new f0 feature that approximates the expected human EEG response to the f0 in order to improve neural tracking results. Methods: Two techniques were explored: constructing the feature with a phenomenological model to simulate neural processing in the auditory periphery and low-pass filtering the feature to approximate the effect of more central processing. Results: Analysis of EEG-data evoked by a Flemish story in 34 subjects indicated that both the auditory model and the low-pass filter significantly improved the correlations between the actual and reconstructed feature. The combination of both strategies almost doubled the mean correlation across subjects, from 0.078 to 0.13. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis revealed two distinct processes contributing to the f0 response: one driven by broad range of auditory nerve fibers with center frequency up to 8 kHz and one driven by a more narrow selection of auditory nerve fibers, possibly responding to unresolved harmonics. Conclusion: Optimizing the f0 feature towards the expected neural response, significantly improves f0-tracking correlations. Significance: The optimized f0 feature enhances the f0-tracking method, facilitating future research on temporal auditory processing in the human brain.

While many studies have attempted to classify consumer emotions and perceived pleasantness of olfactory products, no known machine learning approach has yet been developed to directly predict consumer reward-based decision-making, which has greater behavioral relevance. In this proof-of-concept study, participants indicated their decision to have fragrance products repeated after fixed exposures to them. Single-trial power spectral density (PSD) and approximate entropy (ApEn) features were extracted from EEG signals recorded using a wearable device during fragrance exposures, and served as subject-independent inputs for 4 supervised learning algorithms (kNN, Linear-SVM, RBF-SVM, XGBoost). Using a cross-validation procedure, kNN yielded the best classification accuracy (77.6 %) using both PSD and ApEn features. Acknowledging the challenging prospects of single-trial classification of high-order cognitive states especially with wearable EEG devices, this study is the first to demonstrate the viability of using sensor-level features towards practical objective prediction of consumer reward experience.

Method: Speech-evoked electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected from 118 infants during the first year of life during the exposure to speech stimuli that differed principally in fundamental frequency. Language and communication outcomes, namely four subtests of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MCDI)-Chinese version, were collected between 3 and 16 months after initial EEG testing. In the two-way classification, children were classified into those with future MCDI scores below the 25th percentile for their age group and those above the same percentile, while the three-way classification classified them into < 25th, 25th-75th, and > 75th percentile groups. Machine learning (support vector machine classification) with cross validation was used for model construction. Statistical significance was assessed. Results: Across the four MCDI measures of early gestures, later gestures, vocabulary comprehension, and vocabulary production, the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the predictive models were respectively .92 +/- .031, .91 +/- .028, .90 +/- .035, and .89 +/- .039 for the two-way classification, and .88 +/- .041, .89 +/- .033, .85 +/- .047, and .85 +/- .050 for the three-way classification (p < .01 for all models). Conclusions: Future language and communication variability can be predicted by an objective EEG method that indicates the function of the auditory neural pathway foundational to spoken language development, with precision sufficient for individual predictions. Longer-term research is needed to assess predictability of categorical diagnostic status.	[Wong, Patrick C. M.; Lai, Ching Man; Chan, Peggy H.

J	Duru, DG; Alobaidi, M				Goksel Duru, Dilek; Alobaidi, May			Classification of brain electrophysiological changes in response to colour stimuli	PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Colour stimuli; Classification; Machine learning; Event-related potentials		In this study, the classification of ongoing brain activity occurring as a response to colour stimuli was managed and reported. Until now, the classification of the seen colour from brain electrical signals has not been investigated or reported in the related literature. In this study, we aimed to classify EEG brain responses corresponding to blue, green, and red coloured shapes. In addition to the current literature, we focused on ongoing EEG responses instead of using ERP metrics, with visual stimulus-related ERP metrics also compared throughout the study. The feature extraction process was carried out using the Fourier transform to obtain the conventional band power values of the EEG for each stimulus type. Delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma-band power values of each one-second period constituted the feature set. In addition to scalp measurements, a second feature set was obtained based on the inverse solution of the EEG waves. Furthermore, we applied one-way ANOVA for the feature selection prior to classification procedures. Four classifiers were implemented using the reduced feature set and the raw one as well. The differences between scalp responses were localized mainly around the temporal and temporoparietal regions. Our ERP-component findings support the fact that additional brain regions among the visual cortex participate in the colour categorization process of the brain. RGB colours were identified using 1 s EEG data. Ensemble-KNN and KNN achieved the highest accuracy values (93%) when used either with scalp spectral features or source space features.

J	Hussain, I; Young, S; Park, SJ				Hussain, Iqram; Young, Seo; Park, Se-Jin			Driving-Induced Neurological Biomarkers in an Advanced Driver-Assistance System	SENSORS			English	Article						electroencephalogram; physiological biomarker; advanced driver assistance system (ADAS); mental workload; driving simulator	ENTROPY ANALYSIS; EEG ASYMMETRY; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; TASK	Physiological signals are immediate and sensitive to neurological changes resulting from the mental workload induced by various driving environments and are considered a quantifying tool for understanding the association between neurological outcomes and driving cognitive workloads. Neurological assessment, outside of a highly-equipped clinical setting, requires an ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) headset. This study aimed to quantify neurological biomarkers during a resting state and two different scenarios of driving states in a virtual driving environment. We investigated the neurological responses of seventeen healthy male drivers. EEG data were measured in an initial resting state, city-roadways driving state, and expressway driving state using a portable EEG headset in a driving simulator. During the experiment, the participants drove while experiencing cognitive workloads due to various driving environments, such as road traffic conditions, lane changes of surrounding vehicles, the speed limit, etc. The power of the beta and gamma bands decreased, and the power of the delta waves, theta, and frontal theta asymmetry increased in the driving state relative to the resting state. Delta-alpha ratio (DAR) and delta-theta ratio (DTR) showed a strong correlation with a resting state, city-roadways driving state, and expressway driving state. Binary machine-learning (ML) classification models showed a near-perfect accuracy between the resting state and driving state.

An important step on the road towards naturalistic prosthetic control is to decode movement continuously with low-latency. BCIs based on intracortical micro-arrays provide continuous control of robotic arms, but require a minor craniotomy. Surface recordings of neural activity using EEG have made great advances over the last years, but suffer from high noise levels and large intra-session variance. Here, we investigate the use of minimally invasive recordings using stereotactically implanted EEG (sEEG). These electrodes provide a sparse sampling across many brain regions. So far, promising decoding results have been presented using data measured from the subthalamic nucleus or trial-to-trial based methods using depth electrodes. In this work, we demonstrate that grasping movements can continuously be decoded using sEEG electrodes, as well. Beta and high-gamma activity was extracted from eight participants performing a grasping task. We demonstrate above chance level decoding of movement vs rest and left vs right, from both frequency bands with accuracies up to 0.94 AUC. The vastly different electrode locations between participants lead to large variability. In the future, we hope that sEEG recordings will provide additional information for the decoding process in neuroprostheses.

This paper attempts to quantify the face perceptual ability of human subjects using their memory responses, acquired by an electroencephalographic (EEG) device, during engagement of the human subjects in a face recognition task. The entire experimental protocol is designed in the settings of pattern recognition, comprising five main steps, namely artifact removal, feature extraction, classifier training and testing, and face-perception ability measurement. The primary objective of the paper is to design a deep neural network model that utilizes both the temporal and spatial EEG features to categorize the familiar face (FF) and unfamiliar face (UF) responses of human subjects from their brain signals. To extract the spatial information, the acquired raw EEG data is transformed into multi-spectral 2-dimensional images by a deep learning approach. The spatial information, along with the EEG time-frequency domain (temporal) features are then utilized to train the proposed deep neural network, which can preserve the spatial as well as temporal EEG features that are more robust and less sensitive to the variations along each dimension. The proposed deep neural network paradigm demonstrates promising results in classifying the EEG responses for FF and UF recognition with high classification accuracy. Biological underpinning of the cortical mechanism using sLORETA and event related potential (ERP) analysis in perceiving FFs and UFs by both the healthy controls and prosopagnosic patients is also a significant inclusion in the paper. The first and foremost advantage of the proposed work is that it provides a technological means to assess the variations in face perceptual ability of individuals. It can also be used as a biomarker for early prosopagnosia diagnosis.

(Convolvulaceae) plants with the hypothesis that they recognise different hosts at a distance from them, and they change their survival strategy depending on what they detect. We also hypothesised that, as an attempt of prolonging their survival through photosynthesis, the synthesis of chlorophylls (a phenomenon not completely explained in these parasitic plants) would be increased if the plants don't detect a host. We quantified the pigments related to photosynthesis in different treatments and employed techniques such as electrophysiological time series recording, analyses of the complexity of the obtained signals, and machine learning classification to test our hypotheses. The results demonstrate that the absence of a host increases the amounts of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and beta-carotene in these plants, and the content varied depending on the host presented. Besides, the electrical signalling of dodders changes according to the species of host perceived in patterns detectable by machine learning techniques, suggesting that they recognise from a distance different host species. Our results indicate that electrical signalling might underpin important processes such as foraging in plants. Finally, we found evidence for a likely process of attention in the dodders toward the host plants. This is probably to be the first empirical evidence for attention in plants and has important implications on plant cognition studies.

A Machine Learning-Based Method to Identify Bipolar Disorder Patients	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Machine learning; Extreme gradient boosting; Biomedical signals; Bipolar disorders	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; EPILEPTIC SEIZURE; FRACTAL DIMENSION; EEG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; CONSTRUCTION; DEPRESSION; DEPTH	Bipolar disorder is a serious psychiatric disorder characterized by periodic episodes of manic and depressive symptomatology. Due to the high percentage of people suffering from severe bipolar and depressive disorders, the modelling, characterisation, classification and diagnostic analysis of these mental disorders are of vital importance in medical research. Electroencephalogram (EEG) records offer important information to enhance clinical diagnosis and are widely used in hospitals. For this reason, EEG records and patient data from the Virgen de la Luz Hospital were used in this work. In this paper, an extreme gradient boosting (XGB) machine learning (ML) method involving an EEG signal is proposed. Four supervised ML algorithms including a k-nearest neighbours (KNN), decision tree (DT), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and support vector machine (SVM) were compared with the proposed XGB method. The performance of these methods was tested implementing a standard 10-fold cross-validation process. The results indicate that the XGB has the best prediction accuracy (94%), high precision (> 0.94) and high recall (> 0.94). The KNN, SVM, and DT approaches also present moderate prediction accuracy (> 87), moderate recall (> 0.87) and moderate precision (> 0.87). The GNB algorithm shows relatively low classification performance. Based on these results for classification performance and prediction accuracy, the XGB is a solid candidate for a correct classification of patients with bipolar disorder. These findings suggest that XGB system trained with clinical data may serve as a new tool to assist in the diagnosis of patients with bipolar disorder.	[Mateo-Sotos, J.; Torres, A.

C	Heaton, J; Givigi, S			IEEE	Heaton, Jacqueline; Givigi, Sidney			Systems Design for EEG Signal Classification of Sensorimotor Activity Using Machine Learning	2021 15TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (SYSCON 2021)	Annual IEEE Systems Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)	APR 15-MAY 15, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Syst Council			MULTICHANNEL EEG	This paper proposes a systems design for classifying EEG motor movement signals using AI that achieves a high degree of accuracy. EEG motor movement signals are generated by the brain when the subject consciously attempts to move their body. These signals are reflective of the kind of movement they are attempting to achieve, and improving the classification would allow for better assistive devices for the physically disabled. AI classification requires features to be extracted from the raw data. Features can be extracted using different algorithms. The systems design allows the selection of different features. The features used are calculated from the datapoints corresponding to 1 second windows and transformed into the sigma (Sigma), phi (Phi), and omega (Omega) features. To our knowledge, this is the first time that these features have been used with machine learning techniques. The approach allows the use of different classification models. We test the system with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which were both trained on these features, and each window classified independently according to the model. The SVM had an average accuracy of 88%, while the neural network had a higher accuracy of 94%. There was a relatively large amount of variance in the accuracy for different subjects, ranging from 45.9% to 99.6% for the SVM and 24.3% to 99.7% for the ANN. The proof of concept demonstrates that different machine learning algorithms can be used for classification if a pipeline architecture is used.

The understanding of brain processing in the spoken speech is the bridge to the ideal DS-BCI, and lexical tones as an important element in tone languages like Mandarin are desirable to be well explored. This work studied the classification of four Mandarin tones in spoken speech by using electroencephalogram (EEG). Specially, a speech pronunciation experiment was performed to include imagined, intended, and spoken states. The multiple combinations of vowels, consonants, and tones constituted monosyllables as the stimuli. Common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian manifold were used as feature extraction methods, and linear discriminant analysis as classifier. Result showed that the four-class classification accuracy of the Riemannian manifold-based method across all participants was 42.9%, which was 12.3% higher than that of the CSP-based method. This work suggested that the spoken Mandarin tones were decodable with corresponding EEG signals.

Detection of EEG burst-suppression in neurocritical care patients using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Burst suppression; EEG; Unsupervised; Machine learning; Neurocritical care	PATTERNS; SEGMENTATION	Objective: The burst suppression pattern in clinical electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings is an important diagnostic tool because of its association with comas of various etiologies, as with hypoxia, drug related intoxication or deep anesthesia. The detection of bursts and the calculation of burst/suppres-sion ratio are often used to monitor the level of anesthesia during treatment of status epilepticus. However, manual counting of bursts is a laborious process open to inter-rater variation and motivates a need for automatic detection. METHODS: We describe a novel unsupervised learning algorithm that detects bursts in EEG and generates burst-per-minute estimates for the purpose of monitoring sedation level in an intensive care unit (ICU). We validated the algorithm on 29 hours of burst annotated EEG data from 29 patients suffering from status epilepticus and hemorrhage. RESULTS: We report competitive results in comparison to neural networks learned via supervised learning. The mean absolute error (SD) in bursts per minute was 0.93 (1.38). CONCLUSION: We present a novel burst suppression detection algorithm that adapts to each patient individually, reports bursts-per-minute quickly, and does not require manual fine-tuning unlike previous approaches to burst-suppression pattern detection. SIGNIFICANCE: Our algorithm for automatic burst suppression quantification can greatly reduce manual oversight in depth of sedation monitoring.

Five different MLs are implemented, including k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Wye Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The EEG data from fifteen healthy subjects during motor execution (ME) and motor imagination (MI) are pre-processed with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to reduce eye-blinking associated artifacts. A sliding window technique varying from 1 s to 2 s is used to segment the signals. The majority voting (MV) strategy is employed during the post-processing stage. The results show that the application of ICA increases the accuracy of MI up to 6%, which is improved further by 1-2% using the MV (p<0.05). However, the improvement in the accuracies is more significant in MI (>5%) than in ME (<1%), indicating a more significant influence of eye-blinking artifacts in the EEG signals during MI than ME. Among the MLs, both RF and SVM consistently produced better accuracies in both ME and MI. Using RF, the 2 s window size produced the highest accuracies in both ME and MI than the smaller window sizes.

Temporal EigenPAC for Dyslexia Diagnosis	ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IWANN 2021), PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation Systems (QEST)	AUG 23-27, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			Dyslexia diagnosis; Phase-amplitude coupling; EigenPAC; Classification	OSCILLATIONS	Electroencephalography (EEG) signals allow to explore the functional activity of the brain cortex in a non-invasive way. However, the analysis of these signals is not straightforward due to the presence of different artifacts and the very low signal-to-noise ratio. Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC) methods provide a way to extract information from EEG, related to the synchronization among frequency bands. CFC methods are usually applied in a local way, computing the interaction between phase and amplitude at the same electrode. In this work we show a method to compute Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) features among electrodes to study the functional connectivity. Moreover, this has been applied jointly with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore patterns related to Dyslexia in 7-years-old children. The developed methodology reveals the temporal evolution of PAC-based connectivity. Directions of greatest variance computed by PCA are called eigenPACs here, since they resemble the classical eigenfaces representation. The projection of PAC data onto the eigenPACs provide a set of features that has demonstrates their discriminative capability, specifically in the Beta-Gamma bands.

It has been observed that emotion classification using brain signals has great potential over rating-based quantitative analysis. In the consumer segment, the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) people have also been considered an essential consumer base. This study aims to classify consumer preferences while visualising advertisements for BoP consumers. Four types of consumer preferences (most like, like, dislike, most dislike) have been classified while visualising different advertisements. A robust long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep neural network model has been developed for classifying consumer preferences using the EEG signal. The proposed model has achieved 94.18% classification accuracy. The proposed model has attained a significant improvement of 11.71% and 3.24% in terms of classification accuracy over other machine learning classifiers (support vector machine and random forest), respectively. This study aims to add a significant contribution to the research domain of consumer behaviour, as it provides a guideline about the consumer preferences of the BoPs after seeing the online advertisements.

Deep learning approaches have been successfully used in several recent applications to learn features and classify different types of data. However, the number of researches using these approaches in BCI applications is very limited. In this paper, we aim at using the fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) methods to improve the classification performance of EEG motor imagery signals in the framework of e-health Internet of Things. We propose and compare two classification methods based on the fusion of two CNNs. Our results show that the fusion of the CNNs with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers offers a better classification performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The classification performance achieved by our proposed method using the BCI competition IV 2a dataset in terms of accuracy value is 61.68%. This method can be successfully applied to BCI systems where the amount of data is large due to daily recording.

Neural prostheses capable of multi-channel neural recording, on-site signal processing, rapid symptom detection, and closed-loop stimulation are critical to enabling such novel treatments. However, the existing closed-loop neuromodulation devices are too simplistic and lack sufficient on-chip processing and intelligence. In this paper, we first discuss both commercial and investigational closed-loop neuromodulation devices for brain disorders. Next, we review state-of-the-art neural prostheses with on-chip machine learning, focusing on application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC). System requirements, performance and hardware comparisons, design trade-offs, and hardware optimization techniques are discussed. To facilitate a fair comparison and guide design choices among various on-chip classifiers, we propose a new energy-area (E-A) efficiency figure of merit that evaluates hardware efficiency and multi-channel scalability. Finally, we present several techniques to improve the key design metrics of tree-based on-chip classifiers, both in the context of ensemble methods and oblique structures. A novel Depth-Variant Tree Ensemble (DVTE) is proposed to reduce processing latency (e.g., by 2.5x on seizure detection task). We further develop a cost-aware learning approach to jointly optimize the power and latency metrics. We show that algorithm-hardware co-design enables the energy- and memory-optimized design of tree-based models, while preserving a high accuracy and low latency. Furthermore, we show that our proposed tree-based models feature a highly interpretable decision process that is essential for safety-critical applications such as closed-loop stimulation.

Infant neural responses to rhythmic stimuli may offer a solution, as neural tracking of rhythm is atypical in children with developmental language disorders. However, infant brain recordings are noisy. As a first step to developing accurate neural biomarkers, we investigate whether infant brain responses to rhythmic stimuli can be classified reliably using EEG from 95 eight-week-old infants listening to natural stimuli (repeated syllables or drumbeats). Both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) approaches were employed. Applied to one infant at a time, the CNN discriminated syllables from drumbeats with a mean AUC of 0.87, against two levels of noise. The SVM classified with AUC 0.95 and 0.86 respectively, showing reduced performance as noise increased. Our proof-of-concept modelling opens the way to the development of clinical biomarkers for language disorders related to rhythmic entrainment.

Utilizing technology in the age of information and incorporating it into how people learn can produce better learners. Implicit learning is a type of learning of the underlying rules without consciously seeking or understanding the rules; it is commonly seen in small children while learning how to speak their native language without learning grammar. This research aims to introduce a processing system that can systematically identify the relationship between implicit learning events and their Encephalogram (EEG) signal characteristics. This study converted the EEG signal from participants while performing cognitive task experiments into Multiscale Entropy (MSE) data. Using MSE data from different frequency bands and channels as features, the system explored a wide range of classifiers and observed their performance to see how they classified the features related to participants' performance. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method was used for feature selection to improve the process to make the system more efficient. The results showed that the system could correctly identify the differences between participants' performance using MSE data and the ABC method with 95% confidence.

In fact, if a problem occurs in our brain, we cannot walk correctly. Therefore, the analysis of the coupling of brain activity and walking is very important especially in rehabilitation science. The complexity of movement paths is one of the factors that affect human walking. For instance, if we walk on a path that is more complex, our brain activity increases to adjust our movements. OBJECTIVE: This study for the first time analyzed the coupling of walking paths and brain reaction from the information point of view. METHODS: We analyzed the Shannon entropy for electroencephalography (EEG) signals versus the walking paths in order to relate their information contents. RESULTS: According to the results, walking on a path that contains more information causes more information in EEG signals. A strong correlation (p = 0.9999) was observed between the information contents of EEG signals and walking paths. Our method of analysis can also be used to investigate the relation among other physiological signals of a human and walking paths, which has great benefits in rehabilitation science.

The fast Fourier transform (FFT) has been applied in a novel way to generate the EEG matrix. And a PCA neural network (PCANet) is designed to learn the hidden information from the frequency matrix of EEG signals. And these deep features are then given as inputs to train a support vector machine (SVM) for recognition of epileptic seizures. The experiments are carried out with two authoritative databases provided by the Bonn University (Database A) and Children's Hospital in Boston (Database B), relatively. Additionally, we have evaluated the influence of all parameters for the proposed scheme to obtain the optimal model with better generalization and expansibility. The proposed feature learning method concerned in this work is proved very useful to distinguish seizure events from both short and long EEG recordings. Experimental results obtained by analyzing Database A are not less than 99% accuracy in seven problems. The effectiveness is also verified on Database B with an average accuracy of 98.47% across 23 patients. Our FFT-based PCANet not only achieves the satisfied results, but also exhibits better stability across different classification cases or patients, which indicates the worth in practical applications for diagnostic reference in clinics.

Wearable Reduced-Channel EEG System for Remote Seizure Monitoring	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						seizure detection; wearables; remote monitoring; machine learning; EEG	SCALP EEG; EPILEPSY	Epitel has developed Epilog, a miniature, wireless, wearable electroencephalography (EEG) sensor. Four Epilog sensors are combined as part of Epitel's Remote EEG Monitoring platform (REMI) to create 10 channels of EEG for remote patient monitoring. REMI is designed to provide comprehensive spatial EEG recordings that can be administered by non-specialized medical personnel in any medical center. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurate epileptologists are at remotely reviewing Epilog sensor EEG in the 10-channel "REMI montage," with and without seizure detection support software. Three board certified epileptologists reviewed the REMI montage from 20 subjects who wore four Epilog sensors for up to 5 days alongside traditional video-EEG in the EMU, 10 of whom experienced a total of 24 focal-onset electrographic seizures and 10 of whom experienced no seizures or epileptiform activity. Epileptologists randomly reviewed the same datasets with and without clinical decision support annotations from an automated seizure detection algorithm tuned to be highly sensitive. Blinded consensus review of unannotated Epilog EEG in the REMI montage detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Consensus detection of individual focal onset seizures resulted in a mean sensitivity of 61%, precision of 80%, and false detection rate (FDR) of 0.002 false positives per hour (FP/h) of data. With algorithm seizure detection annotations, the consensus review mean sensitivity improved to 68% with a slight increase in FDR (0.005 FP/h). As seizure detection software, the automated algorithm detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity, and detected individual focal onset seizures with a mean sensitivity of 90% and mean false alarm rate of 0.087 FP/h. This is the first study showing epileptologists' ability to blindly review EEG from four Epilog sensors in the REMI montage, and the results demonstrate the clinical potential to accurately identify patients experiencing electrographic seizures. Additionally, the automated algorithm shows promise as clinical decision support software to detect discrete electrographic seizures in individual records as accurately as FDA-cleared predicates.</p>	[Frankel, Mitchell A.; Lehmkuhle, Mark J.] Epitel Inc, Salt Lake City, UT 84111 USA; [Spitz, Mark C.] Univ Colorado, Anschutz Med Ctr, Neurol, Aurora, CO USA; [Newman, Blake J.; Richards, Sindhu, V; Arain, Amir M.] Univ Utah, Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Salt Lake City, UT USA		Lehmkuhle, MJ (corresponding author), Epitel Inc, Salt Lake City, UT 84111 USA.	lehmkuhle@epitel.com			National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [NS100235]	National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))	Funding This work was supported in part by a grant from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NS100235.		35	3	3	4	7	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-2295			FRONT NEUROL	Front.

Despite the previous efforts, it remains a challenge to determine the optimal subset of channels in a subject-specific manner without heavily compromising the classification performance. In this article, we propose a new method, called spatiotemporal-filtering-based channel selection (STECS), to automatically identify a designated number of discriminative channels by leveraging the spatiotemporal information of the EEG data. In STECS, the channel selection problem is cast under the framework of spatiotemporal filter optimization by incorporating a group sparsity constraints, and a computationally efficient algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. The performance of STECS is assessed on three motor imagery EEG datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art spatiotemporal filtering algorithms using full EEG channels, STECS yields comparable classification performance with only half of the channels. Moreover, STECS significantly outperforms the existing channel selection methods. These results suggest that this algorithm holds promise for simplifying BCI setups and facilitating practical utility.

Explainable Sleep Stage Classification with Multimodal Electrophysiology Time-series	2021 43RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE, Elsevier, Inst Engn & Technol				Many automated sleep staging studies have used deep learning approaches, and a growing number of them have used multimodal data to improve their classification performance. However, few studies using multimodal data have provided model explainability. Some have used traditional ablation approaches that "zero out" a modality. However, the samples that result from this ablation are unlikely to be found in real electroencephalography (EEG) data, which could adversely affect the importance estimates that result. Here, we train a convolutional neural network for sleep stage classification with EEG, electrooculograms (EOG), and electromyograms (EMG) and propose an ablation approach that replaces each modality with values that approximate the line-related noise commonly found in electrophysiology data. The relative importance that we identify for each modality is consistent with sleep staging guidelines, with EEG being important for most sleep stages and EOG being important for Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and non-REM stages. EMG showed low relative importance across classes. A comparison of our approach with a "zero out" ablation approach indicates that while the importance results are consistent for the most part, our method accentuates the importance of modalities to the model for the classification of some stages like REM (p < 0.05). These results suggest that a careful, domain-specific selection of an ablation approach may provide a clearer indicator of modality importance. Further, this study provides guidance for future research on using explainability methods with multimodal electrophysiology data. Clinical Relevance- While explainability is helpful for clinical machine learning classifiers, it is important to consider how explainability methods interact with clinical data, a domain for which they were not originally designed.

Classification of alcoholic EEG signals using wavelet scattering transform-based features	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Wavelet scattering transform (WST); Feature extraction; Machine learning; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Support vector machine (SVM); Alcoholism	FEATURE-SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; SVM	Following the research question and the relevant dataset, feature extraction is the most important component of machine learning and data science pipelines. The wavelet scattering transform (WST) is a recently developed knowledge-based feature extraction technique and is structurally like a convolutional neural network (CNN). It preserves information in high-frequency, is insensitive to signal deformations, and generates low variance fea-tures of real-valued signals generally required in classification tasks. With data from a publicly-available UCI database, we investigated the ability of WST-based features extracted from multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to discriminate 1.0-s EEG records of 20 male subjects with alcoholism and 20 male healthy sub-jects. Using record-wise 10-fold cross-validation, we found that WST-based features, inputted to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, were able to correctly classify all alcoholic and normal EEG records. Similar perfor-mances were achieved with 1D CNN. In contrast, the highest independent-subject-wise mean 10-fold cross-validation performance was achieved with WST-based features fed to a linear discriminant (LDA) classifier. The results achieved with two 10-fold cross-validation approaches suggest that the WST together with a con-ventional classifier is an alternative to CNN for classification of alcoholic and normal EEGs. WST-based features from occipital and parietal regions were the most informative at discriminating between alcoholic and normal EEG records.

However, in the cross-subject classification, due to the individual differences between different subjects, the performance is limited. Methods: This paper introduces the idea of transfer learning and presents the sub-band target alignment common spatial pattern (SBTACSP) method and applies it to the cross-subject classification of motor imagery (MI) EEG signals. First, the EEG signals are bandpass-filtered into multiple frequency bands (sub band filtering). Subsequently, the source domain trails are aligned into the target domain space in each frequency band. The CSP algorithm is then employed to extract features among which more representative features are selected by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) approach from each sub-band. Then the features of all sub-bands are fused. Finally, conventional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm is used for MI classification. Results: Our method is evaluated on Datasets IIa and IIb of the BCI Competition IV . Compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed SBTACSP method performed relatively the best and achieved a mean classification accuracy of 75.15% and 66.85% in cross-subject classification of Datasets IIa and IIb respectively. Conclusion: Therefore, the combination of sub-band filtering and transfer learning achieves superior classification performance compared to either one. The proposed algorithms will greatly promote the practical application of MI based BCIs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Physiological and neural signals are measured in neuromarketing to get insight into customers' motivations and preferences, which can help create new marketing materials, product development, pricing, and other marketing sectors. The most prevalent methods of measuring are brain scanning, which measures neural activity, and physiological tracking, which measures eye movement, heart rate, and skin conductivity.

Motor Imagery, part of BCI research field, aims to generate commands by imagining the movements of limbs without performing any real movement. So it is a state in which the subject forces himself/herself into the feeling of performing a particular action. The users provide training data through a particular recording technology, such as EEG, and after the recording, different techniques and algorithms are used to learn patterns from the data in order to map them with a label or output. In this paper, we are interested to investigate, whether it is possible to generate similar results as in the case of imagining the movement of limbs, by imagining the movement of an external object. To investigate this we show to our subject a video of a box that moves through a plane in three different directions, right, left, and forward. The mental task consists of imagining we are moving the box with our brain activity. Since embodiment provides greater accuracy in motor imagery, this kind of visual feedback, when there is no obvious congruity with any daily neural command, brings a greater difficulty than usual motor imagery. The recorded EEG data are split into training and testing subsets, and are fed to a simple convolutional neural network, that tries to learn the different patterns and to classify them. The network demonstrates the possibility to achieve meaningful accuracy for our object movement imagery.

This article introduces a novel proposal to integrate various neuroimaging methods to characterize an autistic brain. In fact, it is challenging to diagnose and detect the disorder; therefore, it requires the most efficient algorithms for detection. A novel autism identification approach with a combination of VMD+PIE+supervised learning approach is propounded, which can fill the existing gap in the field. The EEG dataset is acquired via the Bonn University and Kaggle database to test the proposed method's performance. Firstly, the VMD technique is used for extracting features from each EEG signal. Then the Predictor Importance Estimates (PIE) have been employed to select the best features from the extracted features. Finally, using supervised learning algorithms (KNN, SVM and ANN), the signals are categorized into a normal or autistic group. The outcome illustrates that the proposed technique attains high accuracy, indicating a powerful way to diagnose and categorize autism.

The utility of such systems rely on their accuracy in decoding user intentions. In this research, we build on previous BCI research that explored CNN models for decoding motor imagery tasks. Inspired by denoising autoencoders, we introduce a deeper CNN model with very high drop out rates that performs better at motor imagery tasks by reducing the effects of EEG data artefacts on the decoder. We tested the model on a hand squeeze data-set where our model has outperformed the previous best classifiers. Additionally, given the deeper nature of this model, we have explored its limitations by comparing its performance as both the individual sample size and the number of training data change.

Electrooculogram and electrocardiogram artifacts are common noises in the process of EEG signals acquisition, it seriously affects the extraction of useful information. This paper proposes a processing method on EEG signals by combing independent component analysis (ICA), wavelet transform (WT) and common spatial pattern (CSP). First, the independent component analysis algorithm is used to break the EEG signals into independent components; and then these independent components are decomposed by WT to obtain the wavelet coefficient of each independent source. The soft and hard compromise threshold function is used to process the wavelet packet coefficients. Then the CSP algorithm is used to extract the features of the denoised EEG data. Finally, four common classification algorithms are used for classification to verify the effectiveness of the improved algorithm. The experimental results show that the EEG signals processed by the proposed method has obvious advantages in identify and remove electrooculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) artifacts, meanwhile, it can preserve the neural activity that is missed in the noise component. Cross-comparison experiments also proved that the proposed method has higher classification accuracy than other algorithms. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

J	Gao, YP; Ravi, A; Jiang, N				Gao, Yuanpei; Ravi, Aravind; Jiang, Ning			Effect of Competing Stimuli for Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential and Steady-State Motion Visually Evoked Potential	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Visualization; Steady-state; Electroencephalography; Decoding; Correlation; Protocols; Brain-computer interfaces; Brain-computer interfaces; electroencephalography; SSVEP; SSMVEP	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES	Changes in stimuli proximity have been shown to affect the performance of brain computer interfaces (BCI) based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP). Specifically, closely placed visual stimuli compete for neural representations, which is called the effect of competing stimuli. Recently, steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) has been proposed to alleviate some of the inherent limitations of SSVEP. In this study, the SSVEP and SSMVEP paradigms were systematically compared under three different inter-stimulus distances to modulate the effect of competing stimuli. Offline analysis was performed to study the steady-state response characteristics, strength of the responses and overall BCI decoding performance. Thirteen healthy subjects participated in the experiment; two types of visual stimulus with seven classes were presented: a flickering stimulus for SSVEP and a radial contraction-expansion checkerboard for the SSMVEP. The canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to study the signal characteristics and the offline decoding performance using only three EEG channels, O1, O2 and Oz. The results demonstrated that SSMVEP was not only less sensitive to competing stimuli, but also consistently outperformed SSVEP in their presence. Further, the SSMVEP response reached its steady-state faster than SSVEP. The signal characteristics analysis revealed that the SSVEP performances were better than SSMVEP in the lowest frequency tested (<9 Hz), and SSMVEP performance was significantly better in the highest frequencies investigated (>13 Hz). The findings in this study indicate that SSMVEP is likely a more practical BCI paradigm than the classic SSVEP for many real-world applications.

Several sources including surgical videos, robot tool kinematics, and an electromyogram (EMG) have been proposed to reach this goal. We aimed to extract features from electroencephalogram (EEG) data and use them in machine learning algorithms to classify robot-assisted surgical gestures. EEG was collected from five RAS surgeons with varying experience while performing 34 robot-assisted radical prostatectomies over the course of three years. Eight dominant hand and six non-dominant hand gesture types were extracted and synchronized with associated EEG data. Network neuroscience algorithms were utilized to extract functional brain network and power spectral density features. Sixty extracted features were used as input to machine learning algorithms to classify gesture types. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) F-value statistical method was used for feature selection and 10-fold cross-validation was used to validate the proposed method. The proposed feature set used in the extra trees (ET) algorithm classified eight gesture types performed by the dominant hand of five RAS surgeons with an accuracy of 90%, precision: 90%, sensitivity: 88%, and also classified six gesture types performed by the non-dominant hand with an accuracy of 93%, precision: 94%, sensitivity: 94%.

More precisely, the source separation process is guided by the user's selective auditory attention decoded from his/her EEG response to the stimulus. This high-level prior information is used to select the desired instrument to isolate and to adapt the generic source separation model to the observed signal. To this aim, we leverage the fact that the attended instrument's neural encoding is substantially stronger than the one of the unattended sources left in the mixture. This "contrast" is extracted using an attention decoder and used to inform a source separation model based on non-negative matrix factorization named Contrastive-NMF. The results are promising and show that the EEG information can automatically select the desired source to enhance and improve the separation quality.

Our aim was to provide participants with insights into their current affective and cognitive state by measuring and decoding brain activity. Therefore, a real-time preprocessing, analyzing, and visualization routine was developed based on electroencephalographic (EEG) data measured during a primary study. To explore users' behavioral and neurophysiological reactions, error-tolerance as well as possibilities to improve feedback accuracy by the means of feedback-based event-related potentials (ERPs), we provided either legit or inappropriate sham feedback in a second study. The kind of feedback (legit or inappropriate) had only marginal influence on participants' subsequent performance. On a neuronal level, we did not observe differences in the ERPs evoked by the legit and inappropriate feedback. In qualitative interviews, participants evaluated the feedback as interesting but also sometimes irritating due to odd feedback trials.

In recent years, it has been demonstrated that error-related potentials (ErrPs) can be used as a feedback signal in electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs. However, modern BCIs often take large setup times and are physically restrictive, making them impractical for everyday use. In this paper, we use a mobile and easy-to-setup EEG device to investigate whether an erroneously functioning 1-DOF exoskeleton in different conditions, namely, visually observing and wearing the exoskeleton, elicits a brain response that can be classified. We develop a pipeline that can be applied to these two conditions and observe from our experiments that there is evidence for neural responses from electrodes near regions associated with ErrPs in an environment that resembles the real world. We found that these error-related responses can be classified as ErrPs with accuracies ranging from 60% to 71%, depending on the condition and the subject. Our pipeline could be further extended to detect and correct erroneous exoskeleton behavior in real-world settings.

Although previous studies have examined the topological differences in brain networks between face and non-face processing, the time-varying patterns at different processing stages have not been fully characterized. In this study, dynamic brain networks were used to explore the mechanism of face processing in human brain. We constructed a set of brain networks based on consecutive short EEG segments recorded during face and non-face (ketch) processing respectively, and analyzed the topological characteristic of these brain networks by graph theory. We found that the topological differences of the backbone of original brain networks (the minimum spanning tree, MST) between face and ketch processing changed dynamically. Specifically, during face processing, the MST was more line-like over alpha band in 0-100 ms time window after stimuli onset, and more star-like over theta and alpha bands in 100-200 and 200-300 ms time windows. The results indicated that the brain network was more efficient for information transfer and exchange during face processing compared with non-face processing. In the MST, the nodes with significant differences of betweenness centrality and degree were mainly located in the left frontal area and ventral visual pathway, which were involved in the face-related regions. In addition, the special MST patterns can discriminate between face and ketch processing by an accuracy of 93.39%. Our results suggested that special MST structures of dynamic brain networks reflected the potential mechanism of face processing in human brain.

Among different EEG recording methods, the recording, while a visual stimulation is shown to the subject, is one of the most popular methods. Recently, steady-state visually-evoked potentials (SSVEP) where visual objects are blinking at a fixed frequency have been commonly-used method in brain-computer interfaces. Although various features extracted from SSVEP records have been used, the use of features from wavelet transform should be preferred due to the nonstationary structure of these signals. In this study, the combination of mother wavelet and classifier, which gives the highest accuracy to determine the stimulating frequency, is examined by applying common wavelet features to inputs of classifiers. Features of energy, variance, and entropy were extracted for well-known five EEG frequency bands using six different mother wavelets. Then, classifier performances of six basic classifiers were compared. This study was run for both each subjects individually and all subjects together. Results showed that (i) ANOVA-based feature selection reduces the performances, (ii) there is no unique combination of classifier and mother wavelet while evaluating each subject individually, (iii) the highest performance was achieved by combination of ensemble learner and Reverse Biorthogonal wavelet while evaluating all subjects together.

Yet, how mortality threat (MT) impacts our daily social behavior remains elusive. To address this issue, we developed a dyadic experimental model and recruited 86 adults (43 dyads) to complete two computer-based tasks (i.e. competitive and cooperative button-pressing). We manipulated dyads' awareness of death [MT vs neutral control (NC)] and simultaneously measured their neurophysiological activity using electroencephalography during the task. Several fundamental observations were made. First, the MT group showed significantly attenuated competition and slightly promoted cooperation. Second, compared to NC, MT significantly decreased gamma-band inter-brain synchronization (IBS) in the competitive context, which was associated with increased subjective fear of death within dyads. Notably, those effects were context-specific: we did not observe comparable results in the cooperative context. Finally, a machine-learning approach was successfully used to discriminate between the MT and NC groups based on accumulated IBS. Together, these findings indicate that MT to some extent mitigates interpersonal competition, and such mitigation might be associated with changes in gamma-band IBS.

However, their economic and educational status are predominantly limited by the unavailability of tools and technologies to satisfy their special needs. There is a necessity for technological solutions to constantly increase to overcome their difficulties with everyday activities. Recent days, Brain-computer Interface (BCI) has drawn attention of many researchers as a hands-free tool which can help motion impaired people to control devices, express their opinions and ideas, and communicate with others. The real-time control of sensors and actuators can be implemented using BCI at the expense of high computational resources. In fact, the evolution of brain technology has offered limitless opportunities and possibilities for impaired as well as healthy members to contribute and participate in the society. With the help of human brain signals or an electroencephalogram (EEG), brain activity in the neocortex is measured as voltage differences over the scalp. Information on subjects' intentions and thoughts is encompassed by EEG electrical patterns, which is decoded as important signatures of brain activity. The status quo BCI technology and associated signal processing schemes are advancing fast. It will also improve control of devices in space, people's lives in e-home, or communication in novel ways. This manuscript presents the EEG signal processing and classification techniques to design BCI system as a control or communication device.

Different to other databases, we elicited affect using both short and long videos in two social contexts, one with individual viewers and one with groups of viewers. The database allows the multimodal study of the affective responses, by means of neuro-physiological signals of individuals in relation to their personality and mood, and with respect to the social context and videos' duration. The data is collected in two experimental settings. In the first one, 40 participants watched 16 short emotional videos. In the second one, the participants watched 4 long videos, some of them alone and the rest in groups. The participants' signals, namely, Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), were recorded using wearable sensors. Participants' frontal HD video and both RGB and depth full body videos were also recorded. Participants emotions have been annotated with both self-assessment of affective levels (valence, arousal, control, familiarity, liking and basic emotions) felt during the videos as well as external-assessment of levels of valence and arousal. We present a detailed correlation analysis of the different dimensions as well as baseline methods and results for single-trial classification of valence and arousal, personality traits, mood and social context. The database is made publicly available.

To help detect potential insider threats, the emotional states of humans are identified through a wide range of physiological signals including the galvanic skin response, electrocardiogram, and electroencephalogram (EEG). This paper presents an insider risk assessment system as a fitness for duty security evaluation using EEG brainwave signals with explainable deep learning and machine learning algorithms to classify abnormal EEG signals indicating a potential insider threat and evaluating fitness for duty. The system is designed to be cost-effective by using an Emotiv Insight EEG device with five electrodes. In this study, the data from 17 people in different emotional states were collected. The different levels of emotions were mapped and classified into four risk levels, namely low, normal, medium, and high. The data were collected while the subjects were presented with different images from the scientific international affective picture system. The collected EEG signals were preprocessed to eliminate noise from physical movements and blinking. The data were then used to train self-feature learning of two-and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, Adaptive Boosting, random forest, and K-nearest neighbors models; the proposed method yielded classification accuracies of 96, 75, 97, 94 and 81%, respectively.

Neurologists use an electroencephalogram (EEG) to diagnose this disease. This test illustrates the signaling behavior of a person's brain, allowing, among other things, the diagnosis of epilepsy. From a visual analysis of these signals, neurologists identify patterns such as peaks or valleys, looking for any indication of brain disorder that leads to the diagnosis of epilepsy in a purely qualitative way. However, by applying atest based on Fourier signal analysis through rapid transformation in the frequency domain, patterns can be quantitatively identified to differentiate patients diagnosed with the disease and others who are not. In this article, an analysis of the EEG signal is performed to extract characteristics in patients already classified as epileptic and non-epileptic, which will be used in the training of models based on classification techniques such as logistic regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks. Based on the results obtained with each technique, an analysis is performed to decide which of these behaves better. In this study traditional classification techniques were implemented that had as data frequency data in the channels with distinctive information of EEG examinations, this was done through a feature extraction obtained with Fourier analysis considering frequency bands. The techniques used for classification were implemented in Python and through a comparison of metrics and performance, it was concluded that the best classification technique to characterize epileptic patients are artificial neural networks with an accuracy of 86%.

Principal motivation of this work is to integrate neural and conventional machine learning methods to develop a classification system which can advance the current wearable health systems in terms of computational complexity and accuracy. Being based on processing a single channel EEG processing, the approach is suitable for usage with small wireless sensors. A shallow autoencoder model is utilized for sparse representation of the EEG signal followed by k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier to categorize the data as epileptic or non-epileptic. Using a single EEG channel an optimum sparsity level is explored in the encoded sample. Attaining an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.85%, 99.29% and 98.86% respectively, for CHB-MIT scalp EEG database, proposed classification method outperforms state of-the-art seizure detection methodologies. Experiments has shown that this performance was possible by using a sparsity level of 4 in the auto-encoder. Furthermore, use of shallow learning instead of deep learning approach for generation of sparse but effective representation is computationally lighter than many other feature extraction and preprocessing methods.

J	Li, MA; Ruan, ZW				Li, Ming-ai; Ruan, Zi-wei			A novel decoding method for motor imagery tasks with 4D data representation and 3D convolutional neural networks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						motor imagery EEG; EEG source imaging; convolutional neural network; data representation; time of interest; 4D dipole feature matrix	EEG; CLASSIFICATION	Objective. Motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) produces one of the most commonly used biosignals in intelligent rehabilitation systems. The newly developed 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) is gaining increasing attention for its ability to recognize MI tasks. The key to successful identification of movement intention is dependent on whether the data representation can faithfully reflect the cortical activity induced by MI. However, the present data representation, which is often generated from partial source signals with time-frequency analysis, contains incomplete information. Therefore, it would be beneficial to explore a new type of data representation using raw spatiotemporal dipole information as well as the possible development of a matching 3DCNN. Approach. Based on EEG source imaging and 3DCNN, a novel decoding method for identifying MI tasks is proposed, called ESICNND. MI-EEG is mapped to the cerebral cortex by the standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography algorithm, and the optimal sampling points of the dipoles are selected as the time of interest to best reveal the difference between any two MI tasks. Then, the initial subject coordinate system is converted to a magnetic resonance imaging coordinate system, followed by dipole interpolation and volume down-sampling; the resulting 3D dipole amplitude matrices are merged at the selected sampling points to obtain 4D dipole feature matrices (4DDFMs). These matrices are augmented by sliding window technology and input into a 3DCNN with a cascading architecture of three modules (3M3DCNN) to perform the extraction and classification of comprehensive features. Main results. Experiments are carried out on two public datasets; the average ten-fold CV classification accuracies reach 88.73% and 96.25%, respectively, and the statistical analysis demonstrates outstanding consistency and stability. Significance. The 4DDFMs reveals the variation of cortical activation in a 3D spatial cube with a temporal dimension and matches the 3M3DCNN well, making full use of the high-resolution spatiotemporal information from all dipoles.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings often contain large segments with missing signals due to poor electrode contact or other artifact contamination. Recovering missing values, contaminated segments and lost channels could be highly beneficial, especially for automatic classification algorithms, such as machine/deep learning models, whose performance relies heavily on high-quality data. The current study proposes a new method for recovering missing segments in EEG. Approach. In the proposed method, the reconstructed segment is estimated by substitution of the missing part of the signal with the normalized weighted sum of other channels. The weighting process is based on inter-channel correlation of the non-missing preceding and proceeding temporal windows. The algorithm was designed to be computationally efficient. Experimental data from patients (N = 20) undergoing general anesthesia due to elective surgery were used for the validation of the algorithm. The data were recorded using a portable EEG device with ten channels and a self-adhesive frontal electrode during induction of anesthesia with propofol from waking state until burst suppression level, containing lots of variation in both amplitude and frequency properties. The proposed imputation technique was compared with another simple-structure technique. Distance correlation (DC) was used as a measure of comparison evaluation. Main results.: The proposed method, with an average DC of 82.48 +/- 10.01 (mu +/- sigma)%, outperformed its competitor with an average DC of 67.89 +/- 14.12 (mu +/- sigma)%. This algorithm also showed a better performance when increasing the number of missing channels. Significance. the proposed technique provides an easy-to-implement and computationally efficient approach for the reliable reconstruction of missing or contaminated EEG segments.

J	Yokoyama, H; Kaneko, N; Watanabe, K; Nakazawa, K				Yokoyama, Hikaru; Kaneko, Naotsugu; Watanabe, Katsumi; Nakazawa, Kimitaka			Neural decoding of gait phases during motor imagery and improvement of the decoding accuracy by concurrent action observation	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						walking; motor imagery; action observation; EEG; brain decoding	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; MIRROR NEURONS; WALKING; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT; CORTEX; REPRESENTATIONS; NEUROPROSTHESES	Objective. Brain decoding of motor imagery (MI) not only is crucial for the control of neuroprosthesis but also provides insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Walking consists of stance and swing phases, which are associated with different biomechanical and neural control features. However, previous knowledge on decoding the MI of gait is limited to simple information (e.g. the classification of 'walking' and 'rest'). Approach. Here, we investigated the feasibility of electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding of the two gait phases during the MI of walking and whether the combined use of MI and action observation (AO) would improve decoding accuracy. Main results. We demonstrated that the stance and swing phases could be decoded from EEGs during MI or AO alone. We also demonstrated the decoding accuracy during MI was improved by concurrent AO. The decoding models indicated that the improved decoding accuracy following the combined use of MI and AO was facilitated by the additional information resulting from the concurrent cortical activations related to sensorimotor, visual, and action understanding systems associated with MI and AO. Significance. This study is the first to show that decoding the stance versus swing phases during MI is feasible. The current findings provide fundamental knowledge for neuroprosthetic design and gait rehabilitation, and they expand our understanding of the neural activity underlying AO, MI, and AO + MI of walking. Novelty and significance Brain decoding of detailed gait-related information during motor imagery (MI) is important for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for gait rehabilitation. This study is the first to show the feasibility of EEG decoding of the stance versus swing phases during MI. We also demonstrated that the combined use of MI and action observation (AO) improves decoding accuracy, which is facilitated by the concurrent and synergistic involvement of the cortical activations for MI and AO. These findings extend the current understanding of neural activity and the combined effects of AO and MI and provide a basis for effective techniques for walking rehabilitation.

Most cases of TBI are mild in nature, yet some individuals may develop following-up persistent disability. The pathophysiologic causes for those with persistent postconcussive symptoms are most likely multifactorial and the underlying mechanism is not well understood, although it is clear that sleep disturbances feature prominently in those with persistent disability. The sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a direct window into neuronal activity during an otherwise highly stereotyped behavioral state, and represents a promising quantitative measure for TBI diagnosis and prognosis. With the everevolving domain of machine learning, deep convolutional neural networks, and the development of better architectures, these approaches hold promise to solve some of the long entrenched challenges of personalized medicine for uses in recommendation systems and/or in health monitoring systems. In particular, advanced EEG analysis to identify putative EEG biomarkers of neurological disease could be highly relevant in the prognostication of mild TBI, an otherwise heterogeneous disorder with a wide range of affected phenotypes and disability levels. In this work, we investigate the use of various machine learning techniques and deep neural network architectures on a cohort of human subjects with sleep EEG recordings from overnight, in-lab, diagnostic polysomnography (PSG). An optimal scheme is explored for the classification of TBI versus non-TBI control subjects. The results were promising with an accuracy of similar to 95% in random sampling arrangement and similar to 70% in independent validation arrangement when appropriate parameters were used using a small number of subjects (10 mTBI subjects and 9 age-and sex-matched controls). We are thus confident that, with additional data and further studies, we would be able to build a generalized model to detect TBI accurately, not only via attended, in-lab PSG recordings, but also in practical scenarios such as EEG data obtained from simple wearables in daily life.

Dissimilarity-based time-frequency distributions as features for epileptic EEG signal classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Epileptic seizure; EEG signals; Dissimilarity; Classification; ANN; SVM; LDA; k-NN; TFA; TFD; SPWV; SNR	SEIZURE DETECTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; LEAST-SQUARES; REPRESENTATION; PATTERN; SIMILARITY; DOMAIN; MODEL	This work aims at exploring a general framework embedding techniques from classifiers, Time-Frequency Distributions (TFD) and dissimilarity measures for epileptic seizures detection. The proposed approach consists firstly in computing dissimilarities between TFD of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and secondly in using them to define a decision rule. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed one uses entire TFD of EEG signals and does not require arbitrary feature extraction. Several dissimilarity measures and TFDs have been compared to select the most appropriate for EEG signals. Classifiers, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), have been combined with the proposed approach. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, 13 different classification problems (including 2, 3 and 5-class) pertaining to five types of EEG signals have been used. The comparison between results obtained with the proposed approach and results reported in the literature with the same database of epileptic EEG signals demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for seizure detection. Experimental results show that this approach has achieved highest accuracy in the most studied classification problems. A high value of 98% is achieved for the 5-class problem. Further, in most classification problems with 2 and 3-class, it also yields a satisfactory accuracy of approximately 100%. The robustness of the proposed approach is evaluated with the addition of noise to the EEG signals at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The experimental results show that this approach has a good classification accuracy at low SNRs.

As human neural diseases, diagnosis and analysis need a robust neurological signal. Consequently, the EEG artifacts' eradication is a vital step. In this research paper, the primary motion artifact is detected from a single-channel EEG signal using support vector machine (SVM) and preceded with further artifacts' suppression. The signal features' abstraction and further detection are done through ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithm. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) filtering approach is applied for motion artifact removal. Finally, leftover motion artifacts' unpredictability is removed by applying wavelet transform (WT) algorithm. Finally, results are optimized by using Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm. The results of the assessment confirm that the algorithm recommended is superior to the algorithms currently in use.

Cortical neural networks, necessary for human cognitive function, may be disrupted differently in DLB and AD patients, allowing diagnostic differentiation between AD and DLB. Objective: This proof-of-concept study assessed whether the application of machine learning techniques to data derived from resting-state electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms (discriminant sensor power, 19 electrodes) and source connectivity (between five cortical regions of interest) allowed differentiation between DLB and AD. Methods: Clinical, demographic, and rsEEG datasets from DLB patients (N=30), AD patients (N=30), and control seniors (NOld, N=30), matched for age, sex, and education, were taken from our international database. Individual (delta, theta, alpha) and fixed (beta) rsEEG frequency bands were included. The rsEEG features for the classification task were computed at both sensor and source levels. The source level was based on eLORETA freeware toolboxes for estimating cortical source activity and linear lagged connectivity. Fluctuations of rsEEG recordings (band-pass waveform envelopes of each EEG rhythm) were also computed at both sensor and source levels. After blind feature reduction, rsEEG features served as input to support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Discrimination of individuals from the three groups was measured with standard performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity). Results: The trained SVM two-class classifiers showed classification accuracies of 97.6% for NOld vs. AD, 99.7% for NOld vs. DLB, and 97.8% for AD vs. DLB. Three-class classifiers (AD vs. DLB vs. NOld) showed classification accuracy of 94.79%. Conclusion: These promising preliminary results should encourage future prospective and longitudinal cross-validation studies using higher resolution EEG techniques and harmonized clinical procedures to enable the clinical application of these machine learning techniques.

Wahby			A 3D-convolutional neural network framework with ensemble learning techniques for multi-modal emotion recognition	EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Facial expressions; Multi-modal emotion recognition; Deep learning; Transfer learning; Data augmentation; Ensemble learning techniques		Nowadays, human emotion recognition is a mandatory task for many human machine interaction fields. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal human emotion recognition framework. The proposed scheme utilizes first the 3D-Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) deep learning architecture for extracting the spatio-temporal features from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and the video data of human faces. Then, a combination of data augmentation, ensemble learning techniques is proposed to get the final fusion predictions. The fusion of the multi-modalities in the proposed scheme is carried out using data, and score fusion methods. Hence, three human recognition approaches are built to achieve the proposed goal. They are namely EEG-based emotion recognition approach, face-based emotion recognition approach, and fusion-based emotion recognition approach. For the EEG approach, the 3D-CNN is used to get the final predictions of the EEG signal. For the face approach, the Mask-RCNN object detection technique in combination with OpenCV libraries are first utilized to extract the exact face pixels with emotional content. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is utilized to classify the 3D-CNN output features of the face chunks. For the fusion-based emotion recognition approach, two fusion techniques are experimented; bagging, and stacking. It is found that the stacking technique gives the best accuracy, and achieves recognition accuracies 96.13%, and 96.79% for valence, and arousal classes respectively using the grid search ensemble learning technique due to transferring the weights from the EEG, and the face approaches to the fusion-based emotion recognition approach. The proposed approach outperforms recent works in multi-modal emotion recognition field. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

The system exploits information extracted from the temporal-domain and time-frequency-domain, as part of a hybrid strategy, to discriminate the temporal windows (i.e. EEG epochs) preceding hand sub-movements (open/close) and the resting state. To this end, for each EEG epoch, the associated cortical source signals in the motor cortex and the corresponding time-frequency (TF) maps are estimated via beamforming and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), respectively. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed: specifically, the first CNN is trained over a dataset of temporal (T) data (i.e. EEG sources), and is referred to as T-CNN; the second CNN is trained over a dataset of TF data (i.e. TF-maps of EEG sources), and is referred to as TF-CNN. Two sets of features denoted as T-features and TF-features, extracted from T-CNN and TF-CNN, respectively, are concatenated in a single features vector (denoted as TTF-features vector) which is used as input to a standard multi-layer perceptron for classification purposes. Experimental results show a significant performance improvement of our proposed hybrid-domain DL approach as compared to temporal-only and time-frequency-only-based benchmark approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 76.21 +/- 3.77%.

As with other psychedelics, the experience induced by DMT strongly depends upon contextual factors, yet the neurobiological determinants of this variability remain unknown. The present study investigated changes in neural oscillations elicited by inhaled DMT, and whether baseline electroencephalography (EEG) recordings could predict the subjective effects reported by the participants. Healthy volunteers (N = 35) were measured with EEG before and during the acute effects of DMT consumed in a natural setting. Source-localized neural oscillations were correlated with the results of multiple questionnaires employed to assess the subjective effects of the drug. DMT resulted in a marked reduction of alpha and beta oscillations, and increased posterior spectral power in the delta, theta and gamma bands. The power of fronto-temporal theta oscillations was inversely correlated with scales indexing feelings of unity and transcendence, which are an integral part of the phenomenology of mystical-type experiences. The robustness of these results was supported using a machine learning model for regression trained and tested following a cross-validation procedure. These results are consistent with the observation that the state of mind prior to consuming a psychedelic drug influences the ensuing subjective experience of the user. They also suggest that baseline EEG screenings before administration of a serotonergic psychedelic could be useful to estimate the likelihood of inducing mystical-type experiences, previously linked to sustained positive effects in well-being and improved outcome of therapeutic interventions.

To estimate stable FC patterns from fMRI data, previous studies required long periods in the order of several minutes, in comparison to the human brain that categories visual stimuli within hundreds of milliseconds. Constructing short-time dynamic FC patterns in the order of milliseconds and decoding visual categories is a relatively novel concept. In this study, we developed a multivariate decoding algorithm based on FC patterns and applied it to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. MEG data were recorded from participants presented with image stimuli in four categories (faces, scenes, animals and tools). MEG data from 17 participants demonstrate that short-time dynamic FC patterns yield brain activity patterns that can be used to decode visual categories with high accuracy. Our results show that FC patterns change over the time window, and FC patterns extracted in the time window of 0 similar to 200 ms after the stimulus onset were most stable. Further, the categorizing accuracy peaked (the mean binary accuracy is above 78.6% at individual level) in the FC patterns estimated within the 0 similar to 200 ms interval. These findings elucidate the underlying connectivity information during visual category processing on a relatively smaller time scale and demonstrate that the contribution of FC patterns to categorization fluctuates over time.

Cerebral perfusion pressure (CePP) could represent cerebral circulation during CPR, but it is difficult to measure non-invasively. In this study, we developed the electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain index (EBRI) derived from EEG signals by machine learning techniques, which could estimate CePP accurately in a porcine cardiac arrest model. Methods: We conducted a randomised crossover study using nine female pigs. After 1 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation, we performed CPR with 12 different 2-min tilting angle sessions, including two different head-up tilt (HUT) angles (30 degrees, 15 degrees) twice, horizontal angle (0 degrees) four times and two different head-down tilt (HDT) angles (-15 degrees, -30 degrees) twice with the random order. We collected EEG signals using a single channel EEG electrode in real-time during CPR. We derived the EBRI models to predict the CePP classified by the 5 or 10 groups using three different machine learning algorithms, including the support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and random forest classification (RFC) method. We assessed the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of each model. Results: The accuracy of the EBRI model using an SVM algorithm in the 5-group CePP classification was 0.935 with a standard deviation (SD) from 0.923 to 0.946. The accuracy in the 10-group classification was 0.904 (SD: 0.896, 0.913). The accuracy of the EBRI using the KNN method in the 5-group classification was 0.927 (SD: 0.920, 0933) and in the 10-group was 0.894 (SD: 0.880, 0.907). The accuracy of the RFC algorithm was 0.947 (SD: 0.931, 0.963) in the 5-group classification and 0.920 (SD: 0.911, 0.929) in the 10-group classification. Conclusion: We developed the EBRI model using non-invasive acquisition of EEG signals to predict CePP during CPR.

Methods We recorded self-rated responses and high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) among women, 16 of whom with lifetime IPV-PTSD and 14 with no PTSD, during a face-evaluation task that displayed male face avatars varying in their degree of threat as rated along dimensions of dominance and trustworthiness. Results The study found a significant association between lifetime IPV exposure, under-estimation of dominance, and over-estimation of trustworthiness. Characterization of EEG microstates supported that lifetime IPV-PTSD modulates emotional appraisal, specifically in encoding and decoding processing associated with N170 and LPP evoked potentials. EEG source localization demonstrated an overactivation of the limbic system, in particular the parahippocampal gyrus, in response to non-threatening avatars. Additionally, dysfunctional involvement of attention-related processing anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) was found in response to relatively trustworthy avatars in IPV-PTSD individuals compared with non-PTSD controls. Discussion This study showed that IPV exposure and related PTSD modulate individuals' evaluation of facial characteristics suggesting threat. Atypical processing of these avatar characteristics was marked by group differences in brain regions linked to facial processing, emotion regulation, and memory.

J	Trk,; zerdem, MS				Turk, Omer; Ozerdem, Mehmet Sirac			The convolutional neural network approach from electroencephalogram signals in emotional detection	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						classification; CNN; emotion; raw EEG	EEG; FEATURES	Although brain-computer interfaces (BCI) progress rapidly, the desired success has not been achieved yet. One of these BCI is to detect emotional states in humans. An emotional state is a brain activity consisting of hormonal and mental reasons in the face of events. Emotions can be detected by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals due to these activities. Being able to detect the emotional state from EEG signals is important in terms of both time and cost. In this study, a method is proposed for the detection of the emotional state by using EEG signals. In the proposed method, we aim to classify EEG signals without any transform (Fourier transform, wavelet transform, etc.) or feature extraction method as a pre-processing. For this purpose, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as classifiers, together with SEED EEG dataset containing three different emotional (positive, negative, and neutral) states. The records used in the study were taken from 15 participants in three sessions. In the proposed method, raw channel-time EEG recordings are converted into 28 x 28 size pattern segments without pre-processing. The obtained patterns are then classified in the CNN. As a result of the classification, three emotion performance averages of all participants are found to be 88.84%. Based on the participants, the highest classification performance is 93.91%, while the lowest classification performance is 77.70%. Also, the average f-score is found to be 0.88 for positive emotion, 0.87 for negative emotion, and 0.89 for neutral emotion. Likewise, the average kappa value is 0.82 for positive emotion, 0.81 for negative emotion, and 0.83 for neutral emotion. The results of the method proposed in the study are compared with the results of similar studies in the literature. We conclude that the proposed method has an acceptable level of performance.

J	Cai, SQ; Li, PW; Su, EZ; Xie, LH				Cai, Siqi; Li, Peiwen; Su, Enze; Xie, Longhan			Auditory Attention Detection via Cross-Modal Attention	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory attention; attention mechanism; cocktail party; cross-modal; EEG	ATTENDED SPEECH; MOTOR IMAGERY; BRAIN; EEG; TRACKING	Humans show a remarkable perceptual ability to select the speech stream of interest among multiple competing speakers. Previous studies demonstrated that auditory attention detection (AAD) can infer which speaker is attended by analyzing a listener's electroencephalography (EEG) activities. However, previous AAD approaches perform poorly on short signal segments, more advanced decoding strategies are needed to realize robust real-time AAD. In this study, we propose a novel approach, i.e., cross-modal attention-based AAD (CMAA), to exploit the discriminative features and the correlation between audio and EEG signals. With this mechanism, we hope to dynamically adapt the interactions and fuse cross-modal information by directly attending to audio and EEG features, thereby detecting the auditory attention activities manifested in brain signals. We also validate the CMAA model through data visualization and comprehensive experiments on a publicly available database. Experiments show that the CMAA achieves accuracy values of 82.8, 86.4, and 87.6% for 1-, 2-, and 5-s decision windows under anechoic conditions, respectively; for a 2-s decision window, it achieves an average of 84.1% under real-world reverberant conditions. The proposed CMAA network not only achieves better performance than the conventional linear model, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art non-linear approaches. These results and data visualization suggest that the CMAA model can dynamically adapt the interactions and fuse cross-modal information by directly attending to audio and EEG features in order to improve the AAD performance.

However, low reliability and concentration difficulty for some patients during most MI-BCIs involving visual tasks affect the performance of MI-BCI. The integration of vibrotactile stimulation (VibraoStim) with MI-based BCI can solve those issues. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the different effects between eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) during VibroStim on the cerebral activity and network. We designed and conducted an experiment, in which VibroStim (75 Hz) was applied over the belly of the biceps muscle in the left arm for 15 healthy subjects during EC or EO. The resting-state and VibroStim brain activity with EC or EO were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG analysis showed a significant increase in the delta and theta power at C4, and a significant decrease in the alpha power at C4 during EC VibroStim compared to the resting-state. No significant difference was identified in event-related desynchronization (ERD) following VibroStim during EC or EO. A significant increase in the global efficiency and a significant decrease in the characteristic path length during EC VibroStim were observed in the beta band, whereas no significant differ-ences were found during EO VibroStim. These findings indicate, VibroStim feedback, which is suitable for pa-tients with poor vision or those who have difficulty focusing on objects, may improve BCI decoding accuracy by increasing ERD lateralization whether subjects keep EO or EC.

J	Alhudhaif, A				Alhudhaif, Adi			An effective classification framework for brain-computer interface system design based on combining of fNIRS and EEG signals	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Near-infrared spectroscopy; Brain-computer interfaces; Feature weighting; Motor imaginary; EEG	ALGORITHM	Background: The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a relatively new but highly promising special field that is actively used in basic neuroscience. BCI includes interfaces for human-computer communication based directly on neural activity concerning mental processes. Fundamental BCI components consist of different units. In the first stage, the EEG and NIRS signals obtained from the individuals are preprocessed, and the signals are brought to a certain standard. Methods: In order to realize proposed framework, a dataset containing Motor Imaginary and Mental Activity tasks are prepared with Electroencephalography (EEG) and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) signal. First of all, HbO and HbR curves are obtained from NIRS signals. Hbo, HbR, HbO+HbR, EEG, EEG+HbO and EEG+HbR features tables are created with the features obtained by using HbO, HbR, and EEG signals, and feature weighted is carried out with the k-Means clustering centers based attribute weighting method (KMCC-based) and the k-Means clustering centers difference based attribute weighting method (KMCCD-based). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (kNN) classifiers are used to see the classifier differences in the study. Results: As a result of this study, an accuracy rate of 99.7% (with kNN classifier and KMCCD-based weighting) is obtained in the data set of Motor Imaginary. Similarly, an accuracy rate of 99.9% (with SVM and kNN classifier and KMCCD-based weighting) is obtained in the Mental Activity dataset. The weighting method is used to increase the classification accuracy, and it has been shown that it will contribute to the classification of EEG and NIRS BCI systems. The results show that the proposed method increases classifiers' performance, offering less processing power and ease of application. In the future, studies could be carried out by combining the k-Means clustering center-based weighted hybrid BCI method with deep learning architectures. Further improved classifier performances can be achieved by combining both systems.

In this learning pedagogy, students take lessons from pre-loaded lecture videos before coming to the classroom for doubt clearing, discussion, problem solving, etc. However, it is very difficult to ensure that students really pay attention while watching lecture videos. In this paper, we adopt a feature selection technique called 1D local binary pattern (1D-LBP) to analyze captured brain signals of the students. The proposed feature selection technique is termed as 1D Multi-Point Local Ternary Pattern (MP-LTP), which extracts unique statistical features from EEG signals. Subsequently, standard classification techniques are exploited to analyze the attention level of students. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art classification techniques using LBP.

Currently, the LoH is monitored using the conventional methods of either observing the patient's physiological parameters or using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based monitors. To overcome the limitations of the conventional methods, this work implements an accurate EEG-based LoH monitoring processor using a bagged tree machine-learning (BTML) classifier. It is based on 12 temporal and spectral features to incorporate robustness against age variation and achieve high classification accuracy. Spectral features are computed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) that uses time-multiplexed filter (TMF) architecture. The TMF DWT consumes 110.6-nJ/feature vector for a 100-tap filter while reducing the area by 11% compared with the conventional method. Moreover, the BTML is implemented using a pipelined approach which enables an efficient on-chip implementation to reduce the hardware cost by 15x compared with the parallel approach. The proposed processor is implemented using a 180-nm CMOS process with an active area of 0.9 mm(2) while consuming 1.6 mW. The accuracy of the proposed hypnotic state monitor is verified using two EEG databases with a total of 95 patients and achieves a sensitivity and specificity of 95.4% and 97.7%, respectively.

Elucidation of EEG Characteristics of Fuzzy Reasoning-Based Heuristic BCI and Its Application to Patient With Brain Infarction	FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS			English	Article						ankle rehabilitation; brain-computer interface (BCI); EEG; fuzzy template matching; neurorehabilitation		Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on common electroencephalography (EEG) are limited to specific instrumentation sites and frequency bands. These BCI induce certain targeted electroencephalographic features of cognitive tasks, identify them, and determine BCI's performance, and use machine-learning to extract these electroencephalographic features, which makes them enormously time-consuming. In addition, there is a problem in which the neurorehabilitation using BCI cannot receive ambulatory and immediate rehabilitation training. Therefore, we proposed an exploratory BCI that did not limit the targeted electroencephalographic features. This system did not determine the electroencephalographic features in advance, determined the frequency bands and measurement sites appropriate for detecting electroencephalographic features based on their target movements, measured the electroencephalogram, created each rule (template) with only large "High" or small "Low" electroencephalograms for arbitrarily determined thresholds (classification of cognitive tasks in the imaginary state of moving the feet by the size of the area constituted by the power spectrum of the EEG in each frequency band), and successfully detected the movement intention by detecting the electroencephalogram consistent with the rules during motor tasks using a fuzzy inference-based template matching method (FTM). However, the electroencephalographic features acquired by this BCI are not known, and their usefulness for patients with actual cerebral infarction is not known. Therefore, this study clarifies the electroencephalographic features captured by the heuristic BCI, as well as clarifies the effectiveness and challenges of this system by its application to patients with cerebral infarction.

However, this method is tedious, time-consuming, prone to human errors, and unable to detect microstructure of sleep such as cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) which is an important diagnostic factor for the detection of sleep disorders such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The CAP is only observed as subtle changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, making it very difficult for human experts to discern. Hence, it is important to have an automated system developed using artificial intelligence for accurate and robust detection of CAP and sleep stages classification. In this study, a deep learning model based on 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is proposed for CAP detection and homogenous 3-class sleep stages classification, namely wakefulness (W), rapid eye movement (REM) and NREM sleep. The proposed model is developed using standardized EEG recordings. Our developed CNN network achieved good model performance for 3-class sleep stages classification with a classification accuracy of 90.46%. Our proposed model also yielded a classification accuracy of 73.64% using balanced CAP dataset, and sensitivity of 92.06% with unbalanced CAP dataset. Our proposed model correctly identified majority of A-phases which comprised of only 12.6% in the unbalanced dataset. The performance of the developed prototype is ready to be tested with more data before clinical application.	[Loh, Hui Wen; Ooi, Chui Ping; Acharya, U.

Although prospective studies have demonstrated promising performance, most of these studies have been affected by the lack of research between groups and individual subjects, and the accuracy of MI classification still has room for improvement. Due to the inter-individual variability in the EEG classification, enhancing the adaptability and robustness between different individuals is especially critical. Methods & experiments: We developed a novel DL model based on the EEG signals to improve MI classification performance by introducing the local reparameterization trick into convolutional neural networks (LRT-CNN). 109 subjects from PhysioNet Dataset were used to test the proposed model. Firstly, a global classifier was evaluated by four groups. Secondly, individual variability was examined by testing individual subjects. Results: The classification accuracy of global classifier in 20 subjects, 50 subjects, 80 subjects, and 109 subjects are 93.86%, 98.94%, 93.04%, and 92.41%, respectively. The maximum classification accuracy of one individual subject is 99.79%, which is better than the state-of-the-art method and proves the proposed method can handle the challenge of individual variability. Conclusion: We conclude that introducing the local reparameterization trick into convolutional neural networks can significantly improve the accuracy of the MI tasks based on the EEG signals without any complicated and tedious feature engineering works. Besides, encouraging results were obtained both between groups (multiple subjects) and on a single subject. Implication: The experimental results add to the rapidly expanding field of brain science and contribute to our understanding of applying the DL method to address EEG-based classification problems (not limited to MI classification issues).

In this paper, a novel methodology based on Truncation Thresholds (TT) method based Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method and statistical Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature extraction method is proposed to classified left and right hand imaginary movements from EEG signals. The TT method is used to change the selected local maximum and minimum points with EMD to distinguish more accurately the hidden information about the motor imagery cover the sub-bands in the frequency domain in addition to remove the blinking electrooculography (EOG) artefacts. TT method is performed to raw EEG signals. Then, statistical spatial features are extracted with CSP method from each Intrinsic Modal Component (IMF) which is created by used the EEG signals with the EMD method. Finally, the extracted features are fed to three different classifiers which are SVM, KNN and LDA. The proposed methodology is applied to our dataset and public BCI Competition IV-2b dataset. The results show that the proposed methodology provides accuracy of 97% and 94% with using LDA classifier for our dataset and with using KNN classifier for BCI Competition IV-2b dataset, respectively.

J	Jia, GY; Lam, HK; Althoefer, K				Jia, Guangyu; Lam, Hak-Keung; Althoefer, Kaspar			Variable weight algorithm for convolutional neural networks and its applications to classification of seizure phases and types	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Variable weight convolutional neural networks; Machine learning; Seizure phase classification; Seizure type classification		Deep learning techniques have recently achieved impressive results and raised expectations in the domains of medical diagnosis and physiological signal processing. The widely adopted methods include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the existing models possess static connection weights between layers, which might limit the generalization capability and the classification performance of the models as the weights of different layers are fixed after training. Furthermore, to deal with a large amount of data, a neural network with a sufficiently large size is required. This paper proposes the variable weight convolutional neural networks (VWCNNs), which are a type of network structure employing dynamic weights instead of static weights in their convolutional layers and fully-connected layers. VWCNNs are able to adapt to different characteristics of input data and can be viewed as an infinite number of traditional, fixed-weight CNNs. We will show that the proposed VWCNN structure outperforms the conventional CNN in terms of the classification accuracy, generalization capability, and robustness when the inputs are contaminated by noise. In this paper, VWCNNs are applied to the classification of three seizure phases (seizure-free, pre-seizure and seizure) based on measured electroencephalography (EEG) data. VWCNNs achieve 100% test accuracy and show strong robustness in the classification of the three seizure phases, and thus show the potential to be a useful classification tool for medical diagnosis. Furthermore, the classification of seven types of seizures is investigated in this paper using the world's largest open source database of seizure recordings, TUH EEG seizure corpus. Comparisons with conventional CNNs, RNN, MobileNet, ResNet, DenseNet and traditional machine learning methods including random forest, decision tree, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbours, standard neural networks, and Naive Bayes are being conducted using realistic test data sets. The results demonstrate that VWCNNs have advantages over other classifiers in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, in previous research, it is commonly assumed that the training and testing data share the same distribution. Unfortunately, this assumption is not always reasonable, for the variation of EEG can cause a substantial mismatch between datasets easily. The problem mentioned above results in degeneration of traditional emotion classification methods. In this paper, we construct a novel joint adaptation networks (JAN) to address this problem for emotion classification based on EEG. Experimental results on two representative EEG datasets demonstrate its validity. Moreover, further comparisons with the state-of-the-arts methods are also made to confirm its superiority.

J	Wurm, MF; Tagliabue, CF; Mazza, V				Wurm, Moritz F.; Tagliabue, Chiara F.; Mazza, Veronica			Decoding location-specific and location-invariant stages of numerosity processing in subitizing	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; enumeration; MVPA; numerosity; subitizing	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURAL MEASURES; NUMBER; COMPONENT; REPRESENTATION; DYNAMICS; REVEAL; BRAIN; SENSE	Extracting the number of objects in perceived scenes is a fundamental cognitive ability. Number processing is proposed to rely on two consecutive stages: an early object location map that captures individuated objects in a location-specific way and a subsequent location-invariant representation that captures numerosity at an abstract level. However, it is unclear whether this framework applies to small numerosities that can be individuated at once ("subitized"). Here, we reanalyzed data from two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments using multivariate pattern decoding to identify location-specific and location-invariant stages of numerosity processing in the subitizing range. In these experiments, one to three targets were presented in the left or right hemifield, which allowed for decoding target numerosity within each hemifield separately (location specific) or across hemifields (location invariant). Experiment 1 indicated the presence of a location-specific stage (180-200 ms after stimulus), followed by a location-invariant stage (300 ms after stimulus). A time-by-channel searchlight analysis revealed that the early location-specific stage is most evident at occipital channels, whereas the late location-invariant stage is most evident at parietal channels. Experiment 2 showed that both location-specific and location-invariant components are engaged only during tasks that explicitly require numerosity processing, ruling out automatic, and passive recording of numerosity. These results suggest that numerosity coding in subitizing is strongly grounded on an attention-based, location-specific stage. This stage overlaps with the subsequent activation of a location-invariant stage, where a full representation of numerosity is finalized. Taken together, our findings provide clear evidence for a temporal and spatial segregation of location-specific and location-invariant numerosity coding of small object numerosities.

Specifically, this study compared the efficiency of several automatic feature selection methods for automatic feature extraction of the auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) data in brain activities to distinguish auditory octave illusion and nonillusion groups by the difference in ASSR amplitudes using machine learning. We compared univariate selection, recursive feature elimination, principal component analysis, and feature importance by testifying the results of feature selection methods by using several machine learning algorithms: linear regression, random forest, and support vector machine. The univariate selection with the SVM as the classification method showed the highest accuracy result, 75%, compared to 66.6% without using feature selection. The received results will be used for future work on the explanation of the mechanism behind the octave illusion phenomenon and creating an algorithm for automatic octave illusion classification.

This paper designs a bimodal identification system for classroom emotions based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and countenances. The system relies on the Internet of things (IoT) technology to collect EEG signals, and extracts the signal features with fractal dimension and multiscale entropy algorithm. After that, the support vector machine (SVM) was adopted to classify the classroom emotions. Then, the features of countenances were extracted by local binary pattern (LBP). Experimental results show that our system accurately identified 85.7% of classroom emotions. Compared with the traditional countenance-based emotion identification method, the bimodal approach could extract rich information on classroom emotions, and achieve a good effect on emotion identification.

J	An, PF; Yuan, ZY; Zhao, JH				An, Panfeng; Yuan, Zhiyong; Zhao, Jianhui			Unsupervised multi-subepoch feature learning and hierarchical classification for EEG-based sleep staging	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; Sleep staging; Unsupervised feature learning; Hierarchical classification; H-WSVM	SIGNALS; MODEL; SET	As the medium of developing brain-computer interface system, the recognition of EEG signals is complicated and difficult due to the complex nonstationary characteristics and the individual difference between subjects. In this paper, we investigate the EEG signal classification problem and propose a novel unsupervised multisubepoch feature learning and hierarchical classification method for automatic sleep staging. First, we divide the EEG epoch into multiple signal subepochs, and each subepoch is mapped to amplitude axis and time axis respectively to obtain two kinds of feature information with amplitude-time dynamic characteristics. Then, the statistical classification features are extracted from the mapped feature information. Furthermore, we conduct unsupervised feature learning for consistent and specific classification features from the perspective of time series. Finally, according to the differences and similarities of EEG signals in different sleep stages, a hierarchical weighted support vector machine-based classification model (H-WSVM) is established, which can use different feature subsets at each classification level and different weighting parameters for unbalanced data samples. To select the optimal feature subset for detecting each sleep stage, we propose a novel evaluation criterion for feature classification ability based on rough set theory. Experimental results on the most commonly used dataset show that the proposed method has better sleep staging performance and can effectively promote the development and application of EEG sleep staging system.

According to the characteristics of rhythms, EEG signals usually can be divided into several different frequency bands. Most existing methods concatenate multiple frequency band features together and treat them as a single feature vector. However, it is often difficult to utilize band-specific information in this way. In this study, an optimized projection and Fisher discriminative dictionary learning (OPFDDL) model is proposed to efficiently exploit the specific discriminative information of each frequency band. Using subspace projection technology, EEG signals of all frequency bands are projected into a subspace. The shared dictionary is learned in the projection subspace such that the specific discriminative information of each frequency band can be utilized efficiently, and simultaneously, the shared discriminative information among multiple bands can be preserved. In particular, the Fisher discrimination criterion is imposed on the atoms to minimize within-class sparse reconstruction error and maximize between-class sparse reconstruction error. Then, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal solution for the projection matrix and the dictionary. Experimental results on two EEG-based ER datasets show that this model can achieve remarkable results and demonstrate its effectiveness.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; mismatch negativity; predictive coding; auditory processing; multivariate decoding		Mismatch negativity (MMN) is the electroencephalographic (EEG) waveform obtained by subtracting event-related potential (ERP) responses evoked by unexpected deviant stimuli from responses evoked by expected standard stimuli. While the MMN is thought to reflect an unexpected change in an ongoing, predictable stimulus, it is unknown whether MMN responses evoked by changes in different stimulus features have different magnitudes, latencies, and topographies. The present study aimed to investigate whether MMN responses differ depending on whether sudden stimulus change occur in pitch, duration, location or vowel identity, respectively. To calculate ERPs to standard and deviant stimuli, EEG signals were recorded in normal-hearing participants (N = 20; 13 males, 7 females) who listened to roving oddball sequences of artificial syllables. In the roving paradigm, any given stimulus is repeated several times to form a standard, and then suddenly replaced with a deviant stimulus which differs from the standard. Here, deviants differed from preceding standards along one of four features (pitch, duration, vowel or interaural level difference). The feature levels were individually chosen to match behavioral discrimination performance. We identified neural activity evoked by unexpected violations along all four acoustic dimensions. Evoked responses to deviant stimuli increased in amplitude relative to the responses to standard stimuli. A univariate (channel-by-channel) analysis yielded no significant differences between MMN responses following violations of different features. However, in a multivariate analysis (pooling information from multiple EEG channels), acoustic features could be decoded from the topography of mismatch responses, although at later latencies than those typical for MMN. These results support the notion that deviant feature detection may be subserved by a different process than general mismatch detection.

In order to be effective, several artificial intelligence tools rely on large training sets of carefully annotated data. Since labeling is mostly performed manually, it is a costly and error-prone process. Hence, there is increasing interest in devising innovative tools to support the annotation task. In this paper, we report an initial investigation on the application of EEG data mining for evaluating the performance of humans carrying out image annotation tasks. Our approach relies on a cheap portable EEG sensor and on supervised learning methods. We collected a dataset from five volunteers, and performed an initial evaluation of our technique. The achieved results are promising, and pave the way to several research directions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one applying EEG data mining for assessing the performance of labelers.

Recently, great progress has been made in the development of novel paradigms and methods for EEG-based preference detection including attempts to apply BCI research findings in various contexts. Advances in BCI technology have increased the scientists' interest in possible practical applications of BCI technology involving a human-machine interaction. A major objective of our research was to provide an overview of recent advances in EEG-based preference detection applications. As a foundation for our research, we reviewed previous studies in EEG-based neuromarketing and classified them according to their practical domains, research directions, and recording modalities. Another major research goal was to investigate how the analysis of EEG signals using classification algorithms can be applied to recognize and understand consumers' mental states and preferences patterns. To this end, we built three different classification algorithms: the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and the k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Our results demonstrate that RF is more accurate than either KNN or SVM.

Thus, to mitigate the effects of depression, accurate diagnosis and treatment are needed. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is an instrument used to measure and record the brain's electrical activities. It can be utilized to produce the exact report on the level of depression. Previous studies proved the feasibility of the usage of EEG data and deep learning (DL) models for diagnosing mental illness. Therefore, this study proposes a DL-based convolutional neural network (CNN) called DeprNet for classifying the EEG data of depressed and normal subjects. Here, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 score is used for quantifying the level of depression. The performance of DeprNet in two experiments, namely, the recordwise split and the subjectwise split, is presented in this study. The results attained by DeprNet have an accuracy of 0.9937, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.999 is achieved when recordwise split data are considered. On the other hand, an accuracy of 0.914 and the AUC of 0.956 are obtained, while subjectwise split data are employed. These results suggest that CNN trained on recordwise split data gets overtrained on EEG data with a small number of subjects. The performance of DeprNet is remarkable compared with the other eight baseline models. Furthermore, on visualizing the last CNN layer, it is found that the values of right electrodes are prominent for depressed subjects, whereas, for normal subjects, the values of left electrodes are prominent.

Since it is still not very clear about the intrinsic connection relationship among the various EEG channels, it is still a challenging task of how to better represent the topology of EEG channels for emotion recognition. On the other hand, the intensity of the emotion may vary along the different time instants, which would affect the recognition accuracy of emotion. To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel multichannel EEG emotion recognition method called attention-based spatio-temporal graphic long short-term memory (ASTG-LSTM), in which a Dynamic Structured Learning (DSL) branch that focuses on the most emotion-relevant connectivity of the brain is incorporated to represent inter-channel connections of the EEG signals. In addition, a specific spatio-temporal attention is embedded into the DSL branch to improve the invariance ability against the emotional intensity fluctuation.

S.; Ekart, Aniko			A study on CNN image classification of EEG signals represented in 2D and 3D	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						applied intelligence; data preprocessing; human-machine interaction; EEG classification		Objective. The novelty of this study consists of the exploration of multiple new approaches of data pre-processing of brainwave signals, wherein statistical features are extracted and then formatted as visual images based on the order in which dimensionality reduction algorithms select them. This data is then treated as visual input for 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which then further extract 'features of features'. Approach. Statistical features derived from three electroencephalography (EEG) datasets are presented in visual space and processed in 2D and 3D space as pixels and voxels respectively. Three datasets are benchmarked, mental attention states and emotional valences from the four TP9, AF7, AF8 and TP10 10-20 electrodes and an eye state data from 64 electrodes. Seven hundred twenty-nine features are selected through three methods of selection in order to form 27 x 27 images and 9 x 9 x 9 cubes from the same datasets. CNNs engineered for the 2D and 3D preprocessing representations learn to convolve useful graphical features from the data. Main results. A 70/30 split method shows that the strongest methods for classification accuracy of feature selection are One Rule for attention state and Relative Entropy for emotional state both in 2D. In the eye state dataset 3D space is best, selected by Symmetrical Uncertainty. Finally, 10-fold cross validation is used to train best topologies. Final best 10-fold results are 97.03% for attention state (2D CNN), 98.4% for Emotional State (3D CNN), and 97.96% for Eye State (3D CNN). Significance. The findings of the framework presented by this work show that CNNs can successfully convolve useful features from a set of pre-computed statistical temporal features from raw EEG waves. The high performance of K-fold validated algorithms argue that the features learnt by the CNNs hold useful knowledge for classification in addition to the pre-computed features.

Rajendra			Automated Classification of Mental Arithmetic Tasks Using Recurrent Neural Network and Entropy Features Obtained from Multi-Channel EEG Signals	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						mental arithmetic task; multi-channel EEG; entropies; slope entropy; recurrent neural networks; accuracy	FILTER-BANK; SERIES; MODEL; LOCALIZATION; COMPLEXITY; PREDICTION; PATTERNS	The automated classification of cognitive workload tasks based on the analysis of multi-channel EEG signals is vital for human-computer interface (HCI) applications. In this paper, we propose a computerized approach for categorizing mental-arithmetic-based cognitive workload tasks using multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The approach evaluates various entropy features, such as the approximation entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy, dispersion entropy, and slope entropy, from each channel of the EEG signal. These features were fed to various recurrent neural network (RNN) models, such as long-short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU), for the automated classification of mental-arithmetic-based cognitive workload tasks. Two cognitive workload classification strategies (bad mental arithmetic calculation (BMAC) vs. good mental arithmetic calculation (GMAC); and before mental arithmetic calculation (BFMAC) vs. during mental arithmetic calculation (DMAC)) are considered in this work. The approach was evaluated using the publicly available mental arithmetic task-based EEG database. The results reveal that our proposed approach obtained classification accuracy values of 99.81%, 99.43%, and 99.81%, using the LSTM, BLSTM, and GRU-based RNN classifiers, respectively for the BMAC vs. GMAC cognitive workload classification strategy using all entropy features and a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) technique. The slope entropy features combined with each RNN-based model obtained higher classification accuracy compared with other entropy features for the classification of the BMAC vs. GMAC task. We obtained the average classification accuracy values of 99.39%, 99.44%, and 99.63% for the classification of the BFMAC vs. DMAC tasks, using the LSTM, BLSTM, and GRU classifiers with all entropy features and a hold-out CV scheme. Our developed automated mental arithmetic task system is ready to be tested with more databases for real-world applications.

Detection of mind wandering using EEG: Within and across individuals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DYNAMICS; DISRUPTS; ERROR; MODEL	Mind wandering is often characterized by attention oriented away from an external task towards our internal, self-generated thoughts. This universal phenomenon has been linked to numerous disruptive functional outcomes, including performance errors and negative affect. Despite its prevalence and impact, studies to date have yet to identify robust behavioral signatures, making unobtrusive, yet reliable detection of mind wandering a difficult but important task for future applications. Here we examined whether electrophysiological measures can be used in machine learning models to accurately predict mind wandering states. We recorded scalp EEG from participants as they performed an auditory target detection task and self-reported whether they were on task or mind wandering. We successfully classified attention states both within (person-dependent) and across (person-independent) individuals using event-related potential (ERP) measures. Non-linear and linear machine learning models detected mind wandering above-chance within subjects: support vector machine (AUC = 0.715) and logistic regression (AUC = 0.635). Importantly, these models also generalized across subjects: support vector machine (AUC = 0.613) and logistic regression (AUC = 0.609), suggesting we can reliably predict a given individual's attention state based on ERP patterns observed in the group. This study is the first to demonstrate that machine learning models can generalize to "never-seen-before" individuals using electrophysiological measures, highlighting their potential for real-time prediction of covert attention states.

The term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is used to describe individuals whose cognitive impairment departing from their expectations for the age that does not interfere with daily activities. To diagnose these disorders, a combination of time-consuming, expensive tests that has difficulties for the target population are evaluated, moreover, the evaluation may yield subjective results. In the presented study, a novel methodology is developed for the automatic detection of AD and MCI using EEG signals. Methods: This study analyzed the EEGs of 35 subjects (16 MCI, 8 AD, 11 healthy control) with the developed algorithm. The algorithm consists of 3 methods for analysis, discrete wavelet transform(DWT), power spectral density (PSD) and coherence. In the first approach, DWT is applied to the signals to obtain major EEG sub-bands, afterward, PSD of each sub-band is calculated using Burg's method. In the second approach, interhemispheric coherence values are calculated. The variance and amplitude summation of each sub-bands' PSD and the amplitude summation of the coherence values corresponding to the major sub-bands are determined as features. Bagged Trees is selected as a classifier among the other tested classification algorithms. Data set is used to train the classifier with 5-fold cross-validation. Results: As a result, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.5%, 96.21%, 97.96% are achieved respectively. Conclusion: In this study, we have investigated whether EEG can provide efficient clues about the neuropathology of Alzheimer's Disease and mild cognitive impairment for early and accurate diagnosis. Accordingly, a decision support system that produces reproducible and objective results with high accuracy is developed.

Scientists attempted to find crucial features to improve recognition accuracy but challenging. This paper proposed a novel confused emotion recognition method based on EEG, which combine automatic feature extraction (deep learning) and knowledge-based feature extraction. To evaluate our method, we designed an experiment to collect data, the basic idea of which is to induce the confused emotion based on the English listening test. The results show that our method performs better in experiments than Convolution Neural Networks(CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Practical real-time MEG-based neural interfacing with optically pumped magnetometers	BMC BIOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Optically pumped magnetometers (OPM); Event-related potential (ERP); Event-related field (ERF); Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Electroencephalography (EEG)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MAGNETOCARDIOGRAPHY MEASUREMENTS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; BCI; EEG; GAMES; SSVEP; SPEED	Background Brain-computer interfaces decode intentions directly from the human brain with the aim to restore lost functionality, control external devices or augment daily experiences. To combine optimal performance with wide applicability, high-quality brain signals should be captured non-invasively. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a potent candidate but currently requires costly and confining recording hardware. The recently developed optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) promise to overcome this limitation, but are currently untested in the context of neural interfacing. Results In this work, we show that OPM-MEG allows robust single-trial analysis which we exploited in a real-time 'mind-spelling' application yielding an average accuracy of 97.7%. Conclusions This shows that OPM-MEG can be used to exploit neuro-magnetic brain responses in a practical and flexible manner, and opens up new avenues for a wide range of new neural interface applications in the future.

It is hypothesized that the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) plays a key role by inhibiting the motor cortex via the basal ganglia. The electroencephalography (EEG)-derived beta-rhythm (15-29Hz) is thought to reflect communication within this network, with increased right frontal beta-power often observed before successful response inhibition. Recent literature suggests that averaging spectral power obscures the transient, burst-like nature of beta-activity. There is evidence that the rate of beta-bursts following a Stop signal is higher when a motor response is successfully inhibited. However, other characteristics of beta-burst events, and their topographical properties, have not yet been examined. Here, we used a large human (male and female) EEG Stop Signal task (SST) dataset (n=218) to examine averaged normalized beta-power, beta-burst rate, and beta-burst "volume" (which we defined as burst duration x frequency span x amplitude). We first sought to optimize the beta-burst detection method. In order to find predictors across the whole scalp, and with high temporal precision, we then used machine learning to (1) classify successful versus failed stopping and to (2) predict individual stop signal reaction time (SSRT). beta-burst volume was significantly more predictive of successful and fast stopping than beta-burst rate and normalized beta-power. The classification model generalized to an external dataset (n = 201). We suggest beta-burst volume is a sensitive and reliable measure for investigation of human response inhibition.

J	Stieger, JR; Engel, SA; He, B				Stieger, James R.; Engel, Stephen A.; He, Bin			Continuous sensorimotor rhythm based brain computer interface learning in a large population	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper								Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are valuable tools that expand the nature of communication through bypassing traditional neuromuscular pathways. The non-invasive, intuitive, and continuous nature of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based BCIs enables individuals to control computers, robotic arms, wheel-chairs, and even drones by decoding motor imagination from electroencephalography (EEG). Large and uniform datasets are needed to design, evaluate, and improve the BCI algorithms. In this work, we release a large and longitudinal dataset collected during a study that examined how individuals learn to control SMR-BCIs. The dataset contains over 600 hours of EEG recordings collected during online and continuous BCI control from 62 healthy adults, (mostly) right hand dominant participants, across (up to) 11 training sessions per participant. The data record consists of 598 recording sessions, and over 250,000 trials of 4 different motor-imagery-based BCI tasks. The current dataset presents one of the largest and most complex SMR-BCI datasets publicly available to date and should be useful for the development of improved algorithms for BCI control.

We applied information theory (Shannon entropy) to EEG and EMG signals recorded from 12 subjects (7 M, 5 F) during rest and stimulation using three odors (pineapple, banana, vanilla). The results indicated that a larger variation in the molecular complexity of odors causes a larger variation in the information of EMG and EEG signals. Therefore, facial muscles' activity is strongly coupled (r = -0.8399) to the brain's activity. Our analysis method could be further employed to examine the relationship between the brain and other organs by comparing other physiological signals with the brain signals.

In this context, the need for strong recognition performances results in increasingly sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques, which may result in poor performance in a real application (e.g., limiting a real-time implementation). Here, we propose an ensemble approach to effectively balance between ML performance and computational costs in a BCI framework. The proposed model builds a classifier by combining different ML models (base-models) that are specialized to different classification sub-problems. More specifically, we employ this strategy with an ensemble-based architecture consisting of multi-layer perceptrons, and test its performance on a publicly available electroencephalography-based BCI dataset with four-class motor imagery tasks. Compared to previously proposed models tested on the same dataset, the proposed approach provides greater average classification performances and lower inter-subject variability.

EEG and fNIRS signals are combined to increase the dimensionality of the information. Time windows are used to select EEG and fNIRS singles synchronously. However, it ignores that specific modal signals have their own characteristics, when the task is stimulated, the information between the modalities will mismatch at the moment, which has a significant impact on the classification performance. Here we propose a novel crossing time windows optimization for mental arithmetic (MA) based BCI. The EEG and fNIRS signals were segmented separately by sliding time windows. Then crossing time windows (CTW) were combined with each one segment from EEG and fNIRS selected independently. Furthermore, EEG and fNIRS features were extracted using Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) and statistical methods from each sample. Mutual information was calculated for FBCSP and statistical features to characterize the discrimination of crossing time windows, and the optimal window would be selected based on the largest mutual information. Finally, a sparse structured framework of Fisher Lasso feature selection (FLFS) was designed to select the joint features, and conventional Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was employed to perform classification. We used proposed method for a MA dataset. The classification accuracy of the proposed method is 92.52 +/- 5.38% and higher than other methods, which shows the rationality and superiority of the proposed method.

Prediction of epileptic seizures is extremely important so that they can be controlled with medication before they actually occur. Researchers have proposed multiple machine/deep learning based methods to predict epileptic seizures; however, accurate prediction of epileptic seizures with low false positive rate is still a challenge. In this research, we propose a deep learning based ensemble learning method to predict epileptic seizures. In the proposed method, EEG signals are preprocessed using empirical mode decomposition followed by bandpass filtering for noise removal. The class imbalance problem has been mitigated with synthetic preictal segments generated using generative adversarial networks. A three-layer customized convolutional neural network has been proposed to extract automated features from preprocessed EEG signals and combined them with handcrafted features to get a comprehensive feature set. The feature set is then used to train an ensemble classifier that combines the output of SVM, CNN and LSTM using Model agnostic meta learning. An average sensitivity of 96.28% and specificity of 95.65% with an average anticipation time of 33 min on all subjects of CHBMIT has been achieved by the proposed method, whereas, on American epilepsy society-Kaggle seizure prediction dataset, an average sensitivity of 94.2% and specificity of 95.8% has been achieved on all subjects.

Decoding complex neuronal signatures such as direction, speed, orientation from Electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to complex network connectivity in the brain. In the existing work, phase and amplitude-related features are used to decode the direction information during motor execution task. In this paper, we aim to decode the binary direction (left v/s right direction) during hand motor imagination task. We use the phase-related feature known as Wavelet-Phase Locking Value (W-PLV) to decode the hand motor imagery direction on calibration session data of 20 healthy subjects. Further, an online session is conducted on 13 subjects that use the trained model from the calibration session to decode imagined movement direction. The average classification accuracy achieved on calibration and online session data using phase related features (W-PLV) is 64.39 +/- 4.23% and 58.67 +/- 4.06%, respectively. The phase related features (W-PLV) achieve an improvement of 4.82% and 3.04% on calibration and online sessions, respectively compared to the amplitude related features alone. Online decoding of user's intentions such as direction can aid in achieving more natural control of a BCI system.

This study is useful to identify 12 subtle emotions angry (annoying, angry, nervous), calm (calm, peaceful, relaxed), happy (excited, happy, pleased), sad (sleepy, bored, sad). A total 120 emotion signals were collected by using Emotive 14 channel EEG headset. Emotions are elicited by using three types of stimulus thoughts, audio and video. The system is trained by using captured database of emotion signals which include 30 signals of each emotion class. A total of 24 features were extracted by performing Chirplet transform. Band power is ranked as the prominent feature. The multimodel approach of classifier is used to classify emotions. Classification accuracy is tested for K-nearest neighbor (KNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. The system is tested to detect emotions of intellectually disable people. Meditation music therapy is used to stable mental state. It is found that it changed emotions of both intellectually disabled and normal participants from the annoying state to the relaxed state. A 75% positive transformation of mental state is obtained in the participants by using music therapy. This research study presents a novel approach for detailed analysis of brain EEG signals for emotion detection and stabilize mental state.	[Kimmatkar, Nisha Vishnupant; Babu, B.

The first is that measurement devices for physiological signals are expensive and not easy to wear. The second is that unnecessary physiological indexes have not been removed, which is likely to decrease the accuracy of machine learning models. In this study, we used single-channel EEG sensor and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, which are inexpensive and easy to wear. We collected data from 25 participants (18 males and 7 females) and used a deep learning algorithm to construct an emotion classification model based on Arousal-Valence space using several feature combinations obtained from physiological indexes selected based on our criteria including our proposed feature selection methods. We then performed accuracy verification, applying a stratified 10-fold cross-validation method to the constructed models. The results showed that model accuracies are as high as 90% to 99% by applying the features selection methods we proposed, which suggests that a small number of physiological indexes, even from inexpensive sensors, can be used to construct an accurate emotion classification model if an appropriate feature selection method is applied. Our research results contribute to the improvement of an emotion classification model with a higher accuracy, less cost, and that is less time consuming, which has the potential to be further applied to various areas of applications.

Directional Decoding From EEG in a Center-Out Motor Imagery Task With Visual and Vibrotactile Guidance	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						vibrotactile guidance; kinesthetic guidance; motor imagery; electroencephalography; brain-computer interface; directional decoding	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOVEMENT; POTENTIALS; SYSTEM; SKIN	Motor imagery is a popular technique employed as a motor rehabilitation tool, or to control assistive devices to substitute lost motor function. In both said areas of application, artificial somatosensory input helps to mirror the sensorimotor loop by providing kinesthetic feedback or guidance in a more intuitive fashion than via visual input. In this work, we study directional and movement-related information in electroencephalographic signals acquired during a visually guided center-out motor imagery task in two conditions, i.e., with and without additional somatosensory input in the form of vibrotactile guidance. Imagined movements to the right and forward could be discriminated in low-frequency electroencephalographic amplitudes with group level peak accuracies of 70% with vibrotactile guidance, and 67% without vibrotactile guidance. The peak accuracies with and without vibrotactile guidance were not significantly different. Furthermore, the motor imagery could be classified against a resting baseline with group level accuracies between 76 and 83%, using either low-frequency amplitude features or mu and beta power spectral features. On average, accuracies were higher with vibrotactile guidance, while this difference was only significant in the latter set of features. Our findings suggest that directional information in low-frequency electroencephalographic amplitudes is retained in the presence of vibrotactile guidance. Moreover, they hint at an enhancing effect on motor-related mu and beta spectral features when vibrotactile guidance is provided.

Corticothalamic Connectivity in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Relationship with Disordered Consciousness and Clinical Outcomes	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Corticothalamic connectivity; Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Mesocircuit; Functional outcome; Mortality	IMPAIRED CONSCIOUSNESS; 2 DECADES; ORGANIZATION; PATTERNS; AROUSAL; NUCLEI; STATE; TIME	Background We present an exploratory analysis of the occurrence of early corticothalamic connectivity disruption after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and its correlation with clinical outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients with acute SAH who underwent continuous electroencephalography (EEG) for impairment of consciousness. Only patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm treatment were included. Continuous EEG tracings were reviewed to obtain artifact-free segments. Power spectral analyses were performed, and segments were classified as A (only delta power), B (predominant delta and theta), C (predominant theta and beta), or D (predominant alpha and beta). Each incremental category from A to D implies greater preservation of corticothalamic connectivity. We dichotomized categories as AB for poor connectivity and CD for good connectivity. The modified Rankin Scale score at follow-up and in-hospital mortality were used as outcome measures. Results Sixty-nine patients were included, of whom 58 had good quality EEG segments for classification: 28 were AB and 30 were CD. Hunt and Hess and World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades were higher and the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score was lower in the AB group compared with the CD group. AB classification was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 5.71 (95% confidence interval 1.61-20.30; p < 0.01) for poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 4-6) at a median follow-up of 4 months (interquartile range 2-6) and an odds ratio of 5.6 (95% confidence interval 0.98-31.95; p = 0.03) for in-hospital mortality, compared with CD. Conclusions EEG spectral-power-based classification demonstrates early corticothalamic connectivity disruption following aneurysmal SAH and may be a mechanism involved in early brain injury. Furthermore, the extent of this disruption appears to be associated with functional outcome and in-hospital mortality in patients with aneurysmal SAH and appears to be a potentially useful predictive tool that must be validated prospectively.

Complicated pipelines or lines increase the burden on patients and inconvenience for medical personnel. Currently, many commercial devices provide related functionalities. However, most devices measure only one biological signal, which can increase the budget for users and cause difficulty in remote integration. In this study, we develop a wearable device that integrates electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), and blood oxygen machines for medical applications with the hope that it can be applied in the future. We develop an integrated multiple-biosignal recording system based on a modular design. The developed system monitors and records EEG, ECG, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) signals for health purposes simultaneously in a single setting. We use a logic level converter to connect the developed EEG module (BR8), ECG module, and SpO(2) module to a microcontroller (Arduino). The modular data are then smoothly encoded and decoded through consistent overhead byte stuffing (COBS). This developed system has passed simulation tests and exhibited proper functioning of all modules and subsystems. In the future, the functionalities of the proposed system can be expanded with additional modules to support various emergency or ICU applications.

Subtleties of this communication require that human-computer interfaces are conceptualized and tested by highly specialized experts. Here we describe a novel academic course for human-oriented designers and project managers, with the emphasis being put on the communication between the human brain and computer. Outcomes of the course were validated on 12 course participants both: qualitatively - educational experience, and quantitatively - outcomes of a project and final exam. T-test comparison revealed that students who participated in the course gained specialized knowledge, as compared to students who did not take part in the course. Moreover, students generally agreed that the course was helpful and interesting, however, about one-third of them considered the course hard. All in all, we find our brain-computer interfaces course useful in instructing specialist oriented on the human-factor of the communication between human and the machine.

Resting-state brain oscillations predict cognitive function in psychiatric disorders: A transdiagnostic machine learning approach	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Resting-state EEG; Transdiagnostic psychiatry; Machine learning; Cognitive function	EEG ALPHA; WAVE FREQUENCY; MEMORY; BAND; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; SYNCHRONY; ATTENTION; NETWORKS	Background: Cognitive dysfunction is widespread in psychiatric disorders and can significantly impact quality of life. Deficits cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries, necessitating new approaches to understand how cognitive function relates to large-scale brain activity and psychiatric symptoms across the diagnostic spectrum. Objective: Using random forest regression, we aimed to identify transdiagnostic patterns linking cognitive function to resting-state EEG oscillations. Methods: 216 participants recruited through an outpatient psychiatric clinic completed the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and underwent a 5-minute eyes-closed resting state EEG recording. We built random forest regression models to predict performance on each cognitive test using the resting-state EEG power spectrum as input, and we compared model performance to a sampling distribution constructed with random permutations. For models that performed significantly better than chance, we used feature importance estimates to identify features of the EEG power spectrum that are predictive of cognitive functioning. Results: Random forest models successfully predicted performance on measures of episodic memory and associative learning (Paired Associates Learning, PAL), information processing speed (Choice Reaction Time, CRT), and attentional set-shifting and executive function (Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift, IED). Oscillatory power in the upper alpha range was associated with better performance on PAL and CRT, while low alpha power was associated with worse CRT performance. Beta power predicted poor performance on all three tests. Theta power was associated with good performance on PAL, and delta and theta oscillations were identified as predictors of good performance on IED. No differences in cognitive performance were found between diagnostic categories. Conclusion: Resting oscillations are predictive of certain dimensions of cognitive function across various psychiatric disorders. These findings may inform treatment development to improve cognition.

However, the lack of interpretability of these algorithms may hinder their applicability to medical decision support systems. This paper studies an interpretable deep learning technique, called SincNet. SincNet is a convolutional neural network that efficiently learns customized band-pass filters through trainable sinc-functions. In this study, we use SincNet to analyze the neural activity of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who experience characteristic differences in neural oscillatory activity. In particular, we propose a novel SincNet-based neural network for detecting emotions in ASD patients using EEG signals. The learned filters can be easily inspected to detect which part of the EEG spectrum is used for predicting emotions. We found that our system automatically learns the high-alpha (9-13 Hz) and beta(13-30 Hz) band suppression often present in individuals with ASD. This result is consistent with recent neuroscience studies on emotion recognition, which found an association between these band suppressions and the behavioral deficits observed in individuals with ASD. The improved interpretability of SincNet is achieved without sacrificing performance in emotion recognition.

Random Convolution Kernels with Multi-Scale Decomposition for Preterm EEG Inter-burst Detection	29TH EUROPEAN SIGNAL PROCESSING CONFERENCE (EUSIPCO 2021)	European Signal Processing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	AUG 23-27, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	European Assoc Signal Proc		Preterm; Electroencephalography; Interburst; ROCKET; Randomised Convolution Kernel		Linear classifiers with random convolution kernels are computationally efficient methods that need no design or domain knowledge. Unlike deep neural networks, there is no need to hand-craft a network architecture; the kernels are randomly generated and only the linear classifier needs training. A recently proposed method, RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transforms (ROCKETs), has shown high accuracy across a range of time-series data sets. Here we propose a multi-scale version of this method, using both high- and low-frequency components. We apply our methods to inter-burst detection in a cohort of preterm EEG recorded from 36 neonates <30 weeks gestational age. Two features from the convolution of 10,000 random kernels are combined using ridge regression. The proposed multi-scale ROCKET method out-performs the method without scale: median (interquartile range, IQR) Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.859 (0.815 to 0.874) for multi-scale versus 0.841 (0.807 to 0.865) without scale, p < 0.001. The proposed method lags behind an existing feature-based machine learning method developed with deep domain knowledge, but is fast to train and can quickly set an initial baseline threshold of performance for generic and biomedical time-series classification.

Advances in this field and the growing knowledge about the neural correlates of the commands issued by the human brain have opened new horizons to socio-cognitive robotics. Research has shown that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can detect electrical activity in the brain. EEG signals contain useful information about brain function and its responses to various phenomena that can be interpreted and sent as control commands. In this paper, an attempt has been made to design and build a mechanical arm that can be guided by moving as well as imagining the movement of the right and left arms. For this purpose, brain signals were taken using an EEG cap. The recorded signals are pre-processed and filtered by the EEGLAB toolbox. The statistical features of these signals were extracted, their number was reduced using the t-test method and the best set was selected by the sequential forward feature selection (SFFS) method. The LDA classifier is then used to classify signals into two classes, the right hand, and the left hand. Motor activities and motor imagery were detected by this algorithm with an accuracy of over 95% and above 90%, respectively. Finally, a mechanical arm with three degrees of freedom was designed and built and the results of the machine learning algorithm were implemented on it.

It is important to control access of negative emotions because it may lead to several chronic health issues like depression and anxiety. The purpose of this research work is to develop a portable brainwave driven system for recognizing positive, negative, and neutral emotions. This research considers the classification of four negative class of emotions using genres sadness, disgust, angry, and surprise along with the classification of three basic class of emotions i.e., positive, negative, and neutral. This paper introduces a long short term memory deep learning (LSTM) network to recognize emotions using EEG signals. The primary goal of this approach is to assess the classification performance of the LSTM model. The secondary goal is to assess the human behavior of different age groups and gender. We have compared the performance of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), LIB-Support Vector Machine (LIB-SVM), and LSTM based deep learning model for classification. The analysis shows that, for four class of emotions LSTM based deep learning model provides classification accuracy as 83.12%, 86.94%, 91.67%, and 94.12% for 50?50, 60?40, 70?30, and 10-fold cross-validations. For three class of emotions LSTM based deep learning model provides classification accuracy as 81.33%, 85.41%, 89.44%, and 92.66% for 50?50, 60?40, 70?30, and 10-fold cross-validation. The generalizability and reliability of this approach are evaluated by applying our approach to publicly available EEG datasets DEAP and SEED. In compliance with the self-reported feelings, brain signals of 18?25 years of age group provided the highest emotional identification. The results show that among genders, females are more emotionally active as compared to males. These results affirmed the potential use of our method for recognizing positive, negative, and neutral emotions.

It affects more than seventy million people throughout the world and becomes second neurological diseases after migraine. Manual inspection of seizures is time consuming and laborious task. Nowadays automated techniques are evolved for detection of seizures by means of signal processing or through machine learning techniques. In this article, supervised learning algorithms are applied to the EEG dataset and performance are measured in terms of Accuracy, precision and few more. Machine learning algorithm plays a vital role in classification and regression problem in the past few decades. The most important reason for this is a large set of signal or data are trained and the test signals are evaluated using training network. To get the better accuracy, the input data are first normalized carefully. The various normalization techniques applied in this article are Z-Score, Min-Max, Logarithmic and Respiratory are used. Dataset consists of 11500 patient details with 5 different cases and each signal are recorded for the duration of 23 seconds. Spider chart is used to show the metric value in detail. It is observed from the result that supervised learning algorithm yields a better result compared to logistic and KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm at high iteration.

However, the human brain is so powerful that in most cases it is capable of accurately filtering out background noises and processing the sound to give the correct interpretation. This phenomenon, however, varies for every individual, and people with hearing disabilities suffer the most challenges. For example, if such a person is placed in a crowded and noisy place when a sentence is spoken, they may only hear garbled and unintelligible noises and thus be unable to interpret the sound correctly. Research tested how the brain interprets information and this showed that the brain can be 'primed' to quickly tune in and understand the language or sound by playing clearer audio versions of the sound before replaying the garbled versions, i.e. the listener learns to understand the sounds. Using this concept, our research focuses on providing a software-based training solution that uses electroencephalogram (EEG) data to determine whether a person with a hearing disability is learning or not. An EEG is a method of recording electrical signals of the brain using electrodes attached to the scalp of a person. The EEG captures a snapshot in time of the electrical activity in the brain and saves the recording as wavy lines. In this paper we present the proposed system framework and also perform experiments to show the feasibility of our approach. Our experiments successfully captured EEG data from the participants when various auditory stimuli are applied and performed preliminary processing on the data to determine whether a user is learning or not.

The best way of analyzing sleep staging is visual interpretations of the polysomnography (PSG) signals recordings from the patients, which is a quite tedious task, requires more domain experts, and time-consuming process. This proposed study aims to develop a new automated sleep staging system using the brain EEG signals. Based on a new automated sleep staging system based on an ensemble learning stacking model that integrates Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting). Additionally, this proposed methodology considers the subjects' age, which helps analyze the S1 sleep stage properly. In this study, both linear (time and frequency) and non-linear features are extracted from the pre-processed signals. The most relevant features are selected using the ReliefF weight algorithm. Finally, the selected features are classified through the proposed two-layer stacking model. The proposed methodology performance is evaluated using the two most popular datasets, such as the Sleep-EDF dataset (S-EDF) and Sleep Expanded-EDF database (SE-EDF) under the Rechtschaffen & Kales (R&K) sleep scoring rules. The performance of the proposed method is also compared with the existing published sleep staging methods. The comparison results signify that the proposed sleep staging system has an excellent improvement in classification accuracy for the six-two sleep states classification. In the S-EDF dataset, the overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa coefficient score obtained by the proposed model is (91.10%, 0.87) and (90.68%, 0.86) with inclusion and exclusion of age feature using the Fpz-Cz channel, respectively. Similarly, the Pz-Oz channel's performance is (90.56%, 0.86) with age feature and (90.11%, 0.86) without age feature. The performed results with the SE-EDF dataset using Fpz-Cz channel is (81.32%, 0.77) and (81.06%, 0.76), using Pz-Oz channel with the inclusion and exclusion of the age feature, respectively. Similarly the model achieved an overall accuracy of 96.67% (CT-6), 96.60% (CT-5), 96.28% (CT-4),96.30% (CT-3) and 97.30% (CT-2) for with 16 selected features using S-EDF database. Similarly the model reported an overall accuracy of 85.85%, 84.98%, 85.51%, 85.37% and 87.40% for CT-6 to CT-2 with 18 selected features using SE-EDF database.

The proposed model with EMD decomposition and WCA optimization together is known as EMD-OAKLSSVM-WCA. Here, two kernel functions i.e., radial basis function and wavelet kernel functions are deployed together to form the added kernel framework. From EMD, intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are obtained where Hilbert transform (HT) is used to obtain analytic form of IMFs. For classifying seizure and non-seizure EEG signals, the frequency modulation bandwidth and amplitude modulation bandwidth parameters are obtained from the analytical IMFs and are used as features for the OAKLSSVM model. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed model which provides better classification accuracy (99.33%) as compared to different promising classifiers and some state-of-the-art models.

Prognosis of automated sleep staging based on two-layer ensemble learning stacking model using single-channel EEG signal	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Sleep stage; EEG signal; Feature screening; Machine learning algorithm; Stacking model	DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION METHOD; ENTROPY FEATURES; INFORMATION; DOMAIN	Sleep is important part for human health and quality of life in the daily routine basis. However, numerous individuals face sleep problems due to rapid changes occurred in both social and professional lifestyles. These problems can lead to several neurological and physical disorder diseases, and therefore, decrease their overall life quality. Machine learning methods for automated sleep stage classification (ASSC) are a fundamental approach to evaluate and treat this public health challenge. The main objective of this study is to propose a high-effective and high-accuracy based multiple sleep staging classification model based on single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using machine learning (ML) model. The proposed automated sleep staging system followed four basic stages: signal preprocessing, feature extraction and screening, classification algorithms, and performance evaluation. In this research work, a novel method is applied for signal preprocessing, feature screening and classification models. In signal preprocessing we obtain the wiener filter techniques for removing the different types of artifacts from input sleep recordings. In feature extraction, we obtain a total of 28 features based on both time and frequency domain features and non-linear features. The relevant features are screened through ReliefF weight feature selection algorithm, and eliminating the redundant features using Pearson correlation coefficients. The important contribution of this research work is establishes two layers an ensembling learning stacking model for classifying the multiple sleep stages. Three different subgroups of ISRUC-Sleep (SG-I/SG-II/SG-III) subjects sleep recordings having different health condition obtained for our proposed experimental work. Comparing with the recent contributions on sleep staging performances using single-channel EEG signals, it has found that our proposed ensemble learning stacking model was reported excellent in sleep staging classification accuracy performance for five sleep stages classification task (CT-5). The overall classification accuracy reported as 99.34%, 90.8%, and 98.50% for SG-I, SG-II, and SG-III dataset, respectively.

Performing voluntary movements is associated with the experience of agency ("sense of agency") over those movements and their outcomes. When people voluntarily control a BMI, they should likewise experience a sense of agency. However, using a BMI to act presents several differences compared to normal movements. In particular, BMIs lack sensorimotor feedback, afford lower controllability and are associated with increased cognitive fatigue. Here, we explored how these different factors influence the sense of agency across two studies in which participants learned to control a robotic hand through motor imagery decoded online through electroencephalography. We observed that the lack of sensorimotor information when using a BMI did not appear to influence the sense of agency. We further observed that experiencing lower control over the BMI reduced the sense of agency. Finally, we observed that the better participants controlled the BMI, the greater was the appropriation of the robotic hand, as measured by body-ownership and agency scores. Results are discussed based on existing theories on the sense of agency in light of the importance of BMI technology for patients using prosthetic limbs.

J	Handa, P; Goel, N				Handa, Palak; Goel, Nidhi			Peri-ictal and non-seizure EEG event detection using generated metadata	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						CHB-MIT EEG; hybrid features; hyper-parameter; metadata; peri-ictal EEG; seizure event detection	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DECOMPOSITION; CHILDREN	Lack of open access, seizure specific database has hindered the development of Automated Seizure Detection System (ASDS) along with state-of-the-art feature selection and classification methods. Available databases contain noise, artefacts, different length & time EEG segments, associated comorbidities, clinical settings, and epilepsy/seizure types etc. Pre-processing of such continuous EEG segments requires significant amount of time and may feed redundant information (with reference to a seizure event) to the classification model leading to inaccurate, real-time seizure event detection systems. Hence, this paper proposes a metadata generation of large EEG databases (here, CHB-MIT EEG scalp database v.1.0.0) for ASDS. We elucidate the need to generate seizure sensitive data through peri-ictal and non-seizure EEG segments. This paper performs multi-variate analysis and two class (non-seizure and seizure event) classification between these fixed length and time EEG segments from support vector machine (SVM) and k-NN classifier. We thoroughly analysed the variation and dependence of different kernels, cost function, gamma, and degree for SVM based pipeline. The proposed pipeline has been compared with state-of-the-art pipelines and has achieved good classification score. Such methods will help in development of generalised approach toward handling large EEG databases and machine learning applications for seizure detection and prediction.

A total of 8 EEG technologists and 5 certified neurophysiologists independently analyzed 20-min EEG recordings. Interrater agreement (IRA) for predefined EEG pattern identification between EEG technologists and neurophysiologits was assessed using percentage of agreement (PA) and Gwet-AC1. Among 1528 EEG recordings, the PA [95% confidence interval] and interrater agreement (IRA, AC1) values were as follows: status epilepticus (SE) and seizures, 97% [96-98%], AC1 kappa=0.97; interictal epileptiform discharges, 78% [76-80%], AC1=0.63; and conclusion dichotomized as "normal" versus "pathological", 83.6% [82-86%], AC1=0.71. EEG technologists identified SE and seizures with 99% [98-99%] negative predictive value, whereas the positive predictive values (PPVs) were 48% [34-62%] and 35% [20-53%], respectively. The PPV for normal EEGs was 72% [68-76%]. SE and seizure detection were impaired in poorly cooperating patients (SE and seizures; p<0.001), intubated and older patients (SE; p<0.001), and confirmed epilepsy patients (seizures; p=0.004). EEG technologists identified ictal features with few false negatives but high false positives, and identified normal EEGs with good PPV. The absence of ictal features reported by EEG technologists can be reassuring; however, EEG traces should be reviewed by neurophysiologists before taking action.

This study was aimed to utilize prior knowledge about the epileptic EEG signals in choosing the algorithms and parameters in order to improve the performance and robustness for seizure detection. Our choices included the kurtosis-based channel selection, five-level empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for EEG signal decomposition adaptive to the power spectra of individual channels, the direct use of the instantaneous time-frequency features, and post-processing of classification outcomes. Using the publicly available CHB-MIT epileptic EEG database, we tested our algorithm against the high performance ones published in the recent literature and the high potential alternatives. Our algorithm achieved the mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 99.77%, 99.88%, and 99.88%, respectively, surpassing the best results in the literature in terms of mean performance. More importantly, the performance was highly consistent across all the tested patient cases. Statistical analysis showed that the levels of EWT and the direct use of time-frequency features had the greatest impacts on the final seizure detection performance. In addition, our results showed that k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) outperformed random forest (RF) classifier, contrary to the finding the RF being the best for seizure detection task in the literature. Our findings demonstrate the value of prior-knowledge-based feature extraction and suggest the equal importance of feature extraction and classifier in the seizure detection algorithm.

J	Tidare, J; Leon, M; Astrand, E				Tidare, Jonatan; Leon, Miguel; Astrand, Elaine			Time-resolved estimation of strength of motor imagery representation by multivariate EEG decoding	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						decoding; multivariate; motor imagery; temporal dynamics; EEG		Objective. Multivariate decoding enables access to information encoded in multiple brain activity features with high temporal resolution. However, whether the strength, of which this information is represented in the brain, can be extracted across time within single trials remains largely unexplored. Approach. In this study, we addressed this question by applying a support vector machine (SVM) to extract motor imagery (MI) representations, from electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and by performing time-resolved single-trial analyses of the multivariate decoding. EEG was recorded from a group of healthy participants during MI of opening and closing of the same hand. Main results. Cross-temporal decoding revealed both dynamic and stationary MI-relevant features during the task. Specifically, features representing MI evolved dynamically early in the trial and later stabilized into a stationary network of MI features. Using a hierarchical genetic algorithm for selection of MI-relevant features, we identified primarily contralateral alpha and beta frequency features over the sensorimotor and parieto-occipital cortices as stationary which extended into a bilateral pattern in the later part of the trial. During the stationary encoding of MI, by extracting the SVM prediction scores, we analyzed MI-relevant EEG activity patterns with respect to the temporal dynamics within single trials. We show that the SVM prediction score correlates to the amplitude of univariate MI-relevant features (as documented from an extensive repertoire of previous MI studies) within single trials, strongly suggesting that these are functional variations of MI strength hidden in trial averages. Significance. Our work demonstrates a powerful approach for estimating MI strength continually within single trials, having far-reaching impact for single-trial analyses. In terms of MI neurofeedback for motor rehabilitation, these results set the ground for more refined neurofeedback reflecting the strength of MI that can be provided to patients continually in time.

Here, we leverage classical and state-of-the-art complexity measures to robustly and automatically detect seizures from scalp recordings. Brain activity is scored through eight features, encompassing traditional time domain and novel measures of recurrence. A binary classification algorithm tailored to treat unbalanced dataset is used to determine whether a time window is ictal or non-ictal from its features. The application of the algorithm on a cohort of ten adult patients with focal refractory epilepsy indicates sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 90%, along with a true alarm rate of 95% and less than four false alarms per day. The proposed approach emphasizes ictal patterns against noisy background without the need of data preprocessing. Finally, we benchmark our approach against previous studies on two publicly available datasets, demonstrating the good performance of our algorithm.

In this algorithm, the K-means clustering method is used to recognize the available hidden patterns in each of the four modes (up, down, left, and right). The identification of these patterns can raise the accuracy of classification. The membership degree of each feature vector in the proposed new patterns is considered as a new feature vector corresponding to the previous feature vector and then, the cursor motion is detected using the linear SVM classifier. Applying the proposed method for data based on the hold-up cross validation causes the accuracy of the classifier in the up-downward and left- rightward movements in each person to increase by 2-10 %.

Speech categorization is better described by induced rather than evoked neural activity	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; ORGANIZATION; SEGREGATION; ATTENTION; ALPHA; GAMMA; EEG	Categorical perception (CP) describes how the human brain categorizes speech despite inherent acoustic variability. We examined neural correlates of CP in both evoked and induced electroencephalogram (EEG) activity to evaluate which mode best describes the process of speech categorization. Listeners labeled sounds from a vowel gradient while we recorded their EEGs. Using a source reconstructed EEG, we used band-specific evoked and induced neural activity to build parameter optimized support vector machine models to assess how well listeners' speech categorization could be decoded via whole-brain and hemisphere-specific responses. We found whole-brain evoked beta-band activity decoded prototypical from ambiguous speech sounds with similar to 70% accuracy. However, induced gamma-band oscillations showed better decoding of speech categories with similar to 95% accuracy compared to evoked beta-band activity (similar to 70% accuracy). Induced high frequency (gamma-band) oscillations dominated CP decoding in the left hemisphere, whereas lower frequencies (theta-band) dominated the decoding in the right hemisphere. Moreover, feature selection identified 14 brain regions carrying induced activity and 22 regions of evoked activity that were most salient in describing category-level speech representations. Among the areas and neural regimes explored, induced gamma-band modulations were most strongly associated with listeners' behavioral CP. The data suggest that the category-level organization of speech is dominated by relatively high frequency induced brain rhythms.

Over 50 million people worldwide are affected by some form of epileptic seizures, and their accurate detection can help millions in the proper management of this condition. Increasing research in machine learning has made a great impact on biomedical signal processing and especially in electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis. The availability of various feature extraction techniques and classification methods makes it difficult to choose the most suitable combination for resource-efficient and correct detection. This paper intends to review the relevant studies of wavelet and empirical mode decomposition-based feature extraction techniques used for seizure detection in epileptic EEG data. The articles were chosen for review based on their Journal Citation Report, feature selection methods, and classifiers used. The high-dimensional EEG data falls under the category of '3N' biosignals-nonstationary, nonlinear, and noisy; hence, two popular classifiers, namely random forest and support vector machine, were taken for review, as they are capable of handling high-dimensional data and have a low risk of over-fitting. The main metrics used are sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy; hence, some papers reviewed were excluded due to insufficient metrics. To evaluate the overall performances of the reviewed papers, a simple mean value of all metrics was used. This review indicates that the system that used a Stockwell transform wavelet variant as a feature extractor and SVM classifiers led to a potentially better result.

Sebastian; Siddiquee, Masudur R.; Fei, Ding-Yu; Bai, Ou			Preliminary Study on Real-Time Prediction of Gait Acceleration Intention From Volition-Associated EEG Patterns	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Acceleration; Legged locomotion; Real-time systems; Task analysis; Prosthetics; Testing; Brain-computer interface; gait acceleration intention; threshold regulation; majority voting; wavelet transform; event related desynchronization; movement related cortical potential		Volitional control of prosthetic devices can potentially provide the user with a more natural movement experience. Currently, there is no feasible volitional triggering method to adapt the prosthetic device to user's intention to accelerate during walking. Therefore, real-time prediction of human acceleration intention from the pre-acceleration electroencephalogram (EEG), and subsequent adaptation of the prosthetic device's control parameters for seamless transition remains a daunting research area. In that aspect, this study investigates the neural changes responsive to human intention to accelerate during walking. Furthermore, this study also explores whether the acceleration intention can be predicted from real-time EEG to subsequently enable parametric adaptation for an external prosthetic device. EEG, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and ground reaction force (GRF) signals were collected from one healthy subject during walking with self-paced speed changes. A set of classifiers were explored to classify between constant speed and acceleration. The classifiers showed promising classification performance well above chance level in offline, pseudo-online and real-time scenarios. An accuracy of 85.9 +/- 2.9% was achieved in offline scenario, while pseudo-online classification resulted in a true positive rate (TPR) of 81.9 +/- 7.4% with 7.7 +/- 0.8 false positives/ min and a detection latency of -844 +/- 572 ms. In real-time scenario, 9 out of 12 acceleration events were predicted successfully with only 3 false predictions at an average latency of -741 ms. Moreover, offline data analysis suggested suppression of mu and beta rhythms related to gait acceleration between 2 seconds before and 1.5 seconds after the onset of acceleration. A slow increase in negative amplitude was also observed in near DC frequencies of EEG data acquired from the sensorimotor cortex. The findings of this study portray inspiring results in retrieving gait acceleration-associated neural changes for facilitating natural control of assistive devices.	[Hasan, S. M.

Methods: Cognitive control is usually applied in information processing and behavioral response. In the preprocessing, baseline correction is implemented to analyze the pre-stimuli, combining ERP to mark the event related potential, studying the time-locked only behavior. Z-score transform, coherence and spec trum are calculated and analyzed in the functional connectivity analysis. In addition to the functional analysis, Bayes Optimizer evaluates the neuro imaging according to the hierarchical Bayes.

Results: Introduction of both user and developers aspects, on its modules from pre-processing, functional analysis and results visualization and evaluation is conducted with one specific clinical data case, including the correlation is higher especially on gamma band and the MVAR coherence on the whole source space depicting the relation between different regions, especially on somatosensory (compared by thalamus) when stimulated by finger activity, phase-lock property of the E/MEG signal and etc. Compared to a manual selection, the scaling parameter prediction can be improved with support vector machine (SVM). The evaluation results with Bayes Optimization, location prediction is superior in the somatosensory area and in the thalamus, the total reconstructed source space is larger, one of the realization of cognitive system comparing different kernels and classifiers. The SVM and discriminant classifier gives similar results evaluating the dipole localization and the parameter choice related as well to the shape parameter, noise level, hyperprior and etc. Conclusion: Approaches of Brain Q are found to be suitable for pre-processing for the EEG and MEG data. The system is capable of functional analysis including coherence and spectral related computation. Machine learning techniques are conducted as well to analyze and evaluate the result of the dipole reconstruction and help to predict the better model parameters and the localization of the origin dipoles. A case on finger stimulation clinical data is conducted and the results of the analysis temporarily and spatially manifests its functionality for users and potential extensions for developers.

They provide the ability to control external devices, such as prosthetic arms and wheelchairs, by using brain activities. Several researchers have reported the inter-communication of multiple brain regions during motor tasks, thus making it difficult to isolate one or two brain regions in which motor activities take place. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the brain's neural patterns is important for BCI in order to provide more useful and insightful features. Thus, brain connectivity provides a promising approach to solving the stated shortcomings by considering inter-channel/region relationships during motor imagination. This study used effective connectivity in the brain in terms of the partial directed coherence (PDC) and directed transfer function (DTF) as intensively unconventional feature sets for motor imagery (MI) classification. MANOVA-based analysis was performed to identify statistically significant connectivity pairs. Furthermore, the study sought to predict MI patterns by using four classification algorithms-an SVM, KNN, decision tree, and probabilistic neural network. The study provides a comparative analysis of all of the classification methods using two-class MI data extracted from the PhysioNet EEG database. The proposed techniques based on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) as a classifier and PDC as a feature set outperformed the other classification and feature extraction techniques with a superior classification accuracy and a lower error rate. The research findings indicate that when the PDC was used as a feature set, the PNN attained the greatest overall average accuracy of 98.65%, whereas the same classifier was used to attain the greatest accuracy of 82.81% with the DTF. This study validates the activation of multiple brain regions during a motor task by achieving better classification outcomes through brain connectivity as compared to conventional features. Since the PDC outperformed the DTF as a feature set with its superior classification accuracy and low error rate, it has great potential for application in MI-based brain-computer interfaces.

Detection of Vigil and Fatigue States During Laparoscopic Tasks Based on EEG Patterns: Towards Neuroergonomics in Medical Training	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						Alpha; EEG Patterns; Laparoscopy; Fatigue; Theta; Vigil	PERFORMANCE; SLEEPINESS	Purpose Fatigue decreases performance in several professional activities. Fatigue can lead to commit technical mistakes, which consequences might be lethal, such as in health area, where a surgical error due to the absence of rest can provoke the patient death. Therefore, this study aims to detect vigil and fatigue (due to lack of sleep) states in medical students through the classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns. Methods For this purpose, EEG signals of 18 physician students were analyzed within theta band (4-8 Hz) over fronto-central recording sites, and alpha band (8-13 Hz) rhythms over temporal and parieto-occipital recording sites during the execution of laparoscopic tasks before and after their medical duties at the Medical School of Tecnologico de Monterrey. EEG signal processing pipeline consisted in pre-processing based on independent component analysis, power spectral density estimates, and Support Vector Machine classification. Results Resulting f-score to differ between vigil and fatigue states was 90.89%, where the first class was slightly more identifiable, reaching a sensitivity of 90.18%. Conclusion Based on this outcome, the detection of fatigue in medical students while their laparoscopic training seems achievable and feasible to diminish technical mistakes that could be lethal in health area. This project moves towards including neuro-ergonomics and human factors in medical trainings to improve the skill acquisition, and thus diminishing technical mistakes during surgeries.

Deep Learning of Explainable EEG Patterns as Dynamic Spatiotemporal Clusters and Rules in a Brain-Inspired Spiking Neural Network	SENSORS			English	Article						interpretable; explainable; dynamic clustering; feature selection; spiking neural networks; spatiotemporal data; EEG data	NEUCUBE	The paper proposes a new method for deep learning and knowledge discovery in a brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) architecture that enhances the model's explainability while learning from streaming spatiotemporal brain data (STBD) in an incremental and on-line mode of operation. This led to the extraction of spatiotemporal rules from SNN models that explain why a certain decision (output prediction) was made by the model. During the learning process, the SNN created dynamic neural clusters, captured as polygons, which evolved in time and continuously changed their size and shape. The dynamic patterns of the clusters were quantitatively analyzed to identify the important STBD features that correspond to the most activated brain regions. We studied the trend of dynamically created clusters and their spike-driven events that occur together in specific space and time. The research contributes to: (1) enhanced interpretability of SNN learning behavior through dynamic neural clustering; (2) feature selection and enhanced accuracy of classification; (3) spatiotemporal rules to support model explainability; and (4) a better understanding of the dynamics in STBD in terms of feature interaction. The clustering method was applied to a case study of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data, recorded from a healthy control group (n = 21) and opiate use (n = 18) subjects while they were performing a cognitive task. The SNN models of EEG demonstrated different trends of dynamic clusters across the groups. This suggested to select a group of marker EEG features and resulted in an improved accuracy of EEG classification to 92%, when compared with all-feature classification. During learning of EEG data, the areas of neurons in the SNN model that form adjacent clusters (corresponding to neighboring EEG channels) were detected as fuzzy boundaries that explain overlapping activity of brain regions for each group of subjects.

J	Noghabaei, M; Han, K; Albert, A				Noghabaei, Mojtaba; Han, Kevin; Albert, Alex			Feasibility Study to Identify Brain Activity and Eye-Tracking Features for Assessing Hazard Recognition Using Consumer-Grade Wearables in an Immersive Virtual Environment	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Virtual reality; Electroencephalograph (EEG); Eye tracking; Safety training; Brain sensing	OPTIMAL FEATURE-SELECTION; CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; TRAINING SYSTEM; EEG; REALITY; PERCEPTION; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; VIGILANCE; STIMULI	Hazard recognition is vital to achieving effective safety management. Unmanaged or unrecognized hazards on construction sites can lead to unexpected accidents. Recent research has identified cognitive failures among workers as being a principal factor associated with poor hazard recognition levels. Therefore, understanding cognitive correlates of when individuals recognize hazards versus when they fail to recognize hazards will be useful in combating poor hazard recognition. Such efforts are now possible with recent advances in electroencephalograph (EEG) and eye-tracking technologies. This paper presents a feasibility study that combines EEG and eye tracking in an immersive virtual environment (IVE) to predict when safety hazards will be successfully recognized during hazard recognition efforts using machine learning techniques. Workers wear a virtual reality (VR) head-mounted device (HMD) that is equipped with an eye-tracking sensor. Together with an EEG sensor, brain activities and eye movements are recorded as the workers navigate a simulated virtual construction site and recognize safety hazards. Through an experiment and a feature extraction and selection process, 13 best features out of 306 features from EEG and eye tracking were selected to train a machine learning model. The results show that EEG and eye tracking together can be leveraged to predict when individuals will recognize safety hazards. The developed IVE can be potentially used to first identify hazard types that are correlated with higher arousal and valence. Also, the developed IVE can be potentially used to evaluate the correlation among arousal, valence, and hazard recognition.

To overcome this problem, the multi-scale recurrence plot and SDA method are combined to extract features of multi-class motor imagery EEG signals for recognition. Firstly, multi-class motor imagery EEG signals are decomposed into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different scale by synchrosqueezed wavelet transform, and the recurrence plot of each IMF is constructed to form one-level feature data as input samples of SDA. Then, high-level abstract features which can better express category attributes are extracted from multi-scale recurrence plot by SDA. Finally, EEG signals are classified by using Softmax classifier. Four types of motor imagery EEG data of Datasets 2a in BCI Competition IV are used to verify the proposed method. The average classification accuracy is 0.89, which shows that the proposed method has good effectiveness and robustness.

Among the various features, peer checks, concurrent verification, independent verification, and communication reconfirmation are major contributors to effective operations in the MCR. In the digital MCR environment of advanced NPPs, there are potential emerging issues of concern related to these contributors resulting from the use of PC-soft controls for reactor operations. The objective of this study is to investigate the development of quantitative indicators for estimating the implicit intentions of reactor operators as a way to mitigate such concerns. The proposed quantitative indicators support peer checks and concurrent/independent verifications for diagnosing and preventing human errors through communication enhancement in a digital technology-based MCR. A machine learning-based algorithm was used to classify two implicit intentions of agreement and disagreement. The classification was based on electroencephalography data measured from human subjects while they performed mock operational tasks using soft controls. The mock operational tasks were based on using a Windows-based nuclear plant performance analyzer (Win-NPA). Statistical analysis was performed on the measured data to identify significant differences between the agreement and disagreement judgments by the operators. An average classification accuracy of 72% was achieved by using a support vector machine classifier for the Win-NPA task with a low number of features across the various Brodmann areas. The methodology proposed in this study may also serve to enhance communications in conventional MCRs for human error minimization.

In particular, the brain function that controls the motor function area has a greater impact on the athlete 's competitive ability. Based on this, it is necessary to adopt scientific methods to recognize brain functions. In this paper, we study the structure of motor brain-computer and improve it based on traditional methods. Moreover, supported by machine learning and SVM technology, this study uses a DSP filter to convert the preprocessed EEG signal X into a time series, and adjusts the distance between the time series to classify the data. In order to solve the inconsistency of DSP algorithms, a multi-layer joint learning framework based on logistic regression model is proposed, and a brain-machine interface system of sports based on machine learning and SVM is constructed. In addition, this study designed a control experiment to improve the performance of the method proposed by this study. The research results show that the method in this paper has a certain practical effect and can be applied to sports.

Deep learning approaches have been introduced in order to challenge the automatic sleep stage classification conundrum. However, the difficulties can be posed in replacing the clinicians with the automatic system due to the differences in many aspects found in individual bio-signals, causing the inconsistency in the performance of the model on every incoming individual. Thus, we aim to explore the feasibility of using a novel approach, capable of assisting the clinicians and lessening the workload. We propose the transfer learning framework, entitled MetaSleepLearner, based on Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), in order to transfer the acquired sleep staging knowledge from a large dataset to new individual subjects (source code is available at https://github.com/IoBT-VISTEC/MetaSleepLearner). The framework was demonstrated to require the labelling of only a few sleep epochs by the clinicians and allow the remainder to be handled by the system. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was also applied to understand the learning course of our approach. In all acquired datasets, in comparison to the conventional approach, MetaSleepLearner achieved a range of 5.4% to 17.7% improvement with statistical difference in the mean of both approaches. The illustration of the model interpretation after the adaptation to each subject also confirmed that the performance was directed towards reasonable learning. MetaSleepLearner outperformed the conventional approaches as a result from the fine-tuning using the recordings of both healthy subjects and patients. This is the first work that investigated a non-conventional pre-training method, MAML, resulting in a possibility for human-machine collaboration in sleep stage classification and easing the burden of the clinicians in labelling the sleep stages through only several epochs rather than an entire recording.

The corresponding EEG features in different frequency bands differ; therefore, personalized screening must be conducted to obtain information that is conducive to the classification of EEG signals for different motor imageries. Also, in current BCI system, to obtain more information, multi-channel electrodes are often used to collect EEG signals, but also increasing the complexity of calculation. In this paper, a personalized feature extraction method based on filter bank and elastic net and a personalized channel selection based on Deep Belief Network to obtain a classification accuracy similar to or even higher than using all channels is proposed. Compared with the typically used feature extraction and classification algorithms, this method obtains higher calculation rates and recognition accuracy and provides a theoretical reference for the practical application of BCI systems. The shortcomings of the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm are addressed. The major contribution of this paper is the flexible screening of feature vectors and channels containing more classification information based on individual differences, thereby preventing the manual adjustment of specific frequency ranges in traditional CSP for performing feature extraction and avoiding inputting all channels. In the case study, the highest test accuracy reaches 86.94%.

However, sleep apnea is a more serious respiratory event, such as complete cessation of respiratory airflow for 10 seconds. The occurrence of hypopnea is a precursor to the occurrence of apnea events and the two are closely connected. In this paper, we propose a method based on the combination of discrete wavelet transform and approximate entropy of EEG signals to detect sleep apnea and hypopnea events. For this purpose, first, data preprocessing is performed on the EEG record data set obtained from Tianjin Chest Hospital, and then infinite impulse response (IIR) Butterworth bandpass filter is used to decompose the data into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Second, descriptive features are extracted based on sub-bands discrete wavelet transform such as the approximate entropy of high-frequency coefficients. Third, the features are filtered based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) recursive elimination. Finally, several machine learning algorithms including SVM, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random forest (RF) are employed to identify the occurrence of sleep hypopnea-apnea events.

In this paper, we discuss a solution to this problem based on a novel step-by-step method of feature extraction and pattern classification for multiclass MI-EEG signals. First, the training data from all subjects is merged and enlarged through autoencoder to meet the need for massive amounts of data while reducing the bad effect on signal recognition because of randomness, instability, and individual variability of EEG data. Second, an end-to-end sharing structure with attention-based time-incremental shallow convolution neural network is proposed. Shallow convolution neural network (SCNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network are used to extract frequency-spatial domain features and time-series features of EEG signals, respectively. Then, the attention model is introduced into the feature fusion layer to dynamically weight these extracted temporal-frequency-spatial domain features, which greatly contributes to the reduction of feature redundancy and the improvement of classification accuracy. At last, validation tests using BCI Competition IV 2a data sets show that classification accuracy and kappa coefficient have reached 82.7 +/- 5.57% and 0.78 +/- 0.074, which can strongly prove its advantages in improving classification accuracy and reducing individual difference among different subjects from the same network.

Detecting Phase-Synchrony Connectivity Anomalies in EEG Signals. Application to Dyslexia Diagnosis	SENSORS			English	Article						functional connectivity; EEG; anomaly detection; self-organizing maps; phase locking value; circular correlation	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SPEECH; CLASSIFICATION; RESPONSES	Objective Dyslexia diagnosis is a challenging task, since traditional diagnosis methods are not based on biological markers but on behavioural tests. Although dyslexia diagnosis has been addressed by these tests in clinical practice, it is difficult to extract information about the brain processes involved in the different tasks and, then, to go deeper into its biological basis. Thus, the use of biomarkers can contribute not only to the diagnosis but also to a better understanding of specific learning disorders such as dyslexia. In this work, we use Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to discover differences among controls and dyslexic subjects using signal processing and artificial intelligence techniques. Specifically, we measure phase synchronization among channels, to reveal the functional brain network activated during auditory processing. On the other hand, to explore synchronicity patterns risen by low-level auditory processing, we used specific stimuli consisting in band-limited white noise, modulated in amplitude at different frequencies. The differential information contained in the functional (i.e., synchronization) network has been processed by an anomaly detection system that addresses the problem of subjects variability by an outlier-detection method based on vector quantization. The results, obtained for 7 years-old children, show that the proposed method constitutes an useful tool for clinical use, with the area under ROC curve (AUC) values up to 0.95 in differential diagnosis tasks.

Methodology proposal of ADHD classification of children based on cross recurrence plots	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Electroencephalogram (EEG); CRP; CRQA; Recurrence plots	EEG SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; QUANTIFICATION ANALYSIS; LEARNING APPROACH; FEATURES; DYNAMICS	Dealing with electroencephalogram signals (EEG) is often not easy. The lack of predicability and complexity of such non-stationary, noisy and high-dimensional signals is challenging. Cross recurrence plots (CRP) have been used extensively to deal with the detection of subtle changes in signals, even when the noise is embedded in the signal. In this contribution, a total of 121 children performed visual attention experiments and a proposed methodology using CRP and a Welch Power Spectral Distribution have been used to classify then between those who have ADHD and the control group. Additional tools were presented to determine to which extent this methodology is able to classify accurately and avoid misclassifications, thus demonstrating that this methodology is feasible to classify EEG signals from subjects with ADHD. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methodology shows higher accuracy in comparison with methods proposed by other authors, providing that the correct recurrence tools are selected. Also, this methodology does not require extensive training such as the methods proposed using classical machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, this proposed methodology shows that it is not required to manually discriminate events among the EEG electrodes since CRP can detect even the smallest changes in the signal even when it has embedded noise. Lastly, the results were compared with baseline machine learning methods to prove experimentally that this methodology is consistent and the results repeatable. Given the right CRP metrics, an accuracy of up to 97.25% was achieved, indicating that this methodology outperformed many of the state-of-the-art techniques.	[Aceves-Fernandez, M.

The novel BCI-based Hit-Loop agent contains human intelligence with BCI-based AIoT-Fuzzy Markup Language (FML) and BCI-FML agents, as well as machine intelligence with AI-FML Hit-Loop and AIoT-FML agents. We used FML to facilitate communication between humans and the AI-FML robots through an AIoT-FML Learning Tool (AIoT-FML-LT), which was the core technology of the AI-FML Hit-Loop agent for the BCI-based music listening and appreciation application. Furthermore, the novel AIoT-FML-LT in conjunction with the BCI-FML and AIoT-FML agents was developed and presented for music listening and student learning. Moreover, the BCI-based AIoT-FML and AI-FML Hit-Loop agents were applied in English language learning, and the AIoT-FML-LT assisted in measuring student learning performance in Taiwan and Japan. The human-like high-level knowledge base and rule base were constructed by various domain experts, as well as the personalized electroencephalography (EEG) and student English learning data sets collected using the BCI device and AIoT-FML-LT, respectively, and were applied to machine learning models such as deep learning and particle swarm optimization. Additionally, the AIoT-FML-LT was connected to the AIoT-FML Hit-Loop agent for human and robot colearning. The relationship between human perceptions and the AIoT-FML Hit-Loop agent in terms of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and brain corresponding to sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, and mind are discussed. Finally, the students learned human language and AI language by using the AI-FML robots and AIoT-FML-LT together with the human English learning and AI-FML machine learning models, respectively. The experimental results reveal that the BCI-based Hit-Loop agent for human and AI-FML robot colearning in conjunction with AIoT applications can effectively facilitate music listening and appreciation application as well as English listening in Taiwan and Japan. The learning behavior and performance of the students also improved after incorporation of the human and robot colearning model.

It is key to understand the link between human brain and behavior, especially for brain computer interface (BCI) applications and rehabilitation of patients suffering with neurological disorders. In this research, we conducted an experiment comparing two stages of visual processing, determined distinct EEG signals associated with them, and subsequently used a classifier to distinguish the two stages. EEG data was collected using a feature-binding experiment that required subjects to detect changes in color and shape binding after 100 ms and after 1500 ms. The two stages denoted by these study-test intervals were determined using features extracted from both time and frequency domains. These were used to separately train various machine learning classifiers. The time-frequency domain representation of the signal was used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). Promising results were obtained. Thus, the contribution of the paper is two-fold. Firstly, we carry out EEG data analysis using deep learning to classify whether the EEG trial belongs to 100 ms class or 1500 ms class. Secondly, we connect these results to predict different stages of visual processing in human brain and visual feature binding. Thus, deep learning can help us predict the stages of visual processing and, hence, unlock important insights regarding the temporal dynamics of brain functioning. This can help in building relevant tools for BCI applications such as neuro-rehabilitation of subjects suffering impairments in visual feature binding.

Previous studies have proposed using manual feature extraction coupled with machine learning, or deep learning to classify between seizure and non-seizure states. New method: In this paper a deep learning based approach is used for neonatal seizure classification using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The architecture detects seizure activity in raw EEG signals as opposed to common state-of-art, where manual feature extraction with machine learning algorithms is used. The architecture is a two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify between seizure/non-seizure states. Results: The dataset used for this study is annotated by three experts and as such three separate models are trained on individual annotations, resulting in average accuracies (ACC) of 95.6 %, 94.8 % and 90.1 % respectively, and average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 99.2 %, 98.4 % and 96.7 % respectively. The testing was done using 10-cross fold validation, so that the performance can be an accurate representation of the architectures classification capability in a clinical setting. After training/testing of the three individual models, a final ensemble model is made consisting of the three models. The ensemble model gives an average ACC and AUC of 96.3 % and 99.3 % respectively. Comparison with existing methods: This study outperforms previous studies, with increased ACC and AUC results coupled with use of small time windows (1 s) used for evaluation. Conclusion: The proposed approach is promising for detecting seizure activity in unseen neonate data in a clinical setting.	[Tanveer, M.

A plethora of efforts has been invested on using pervasive sensor data (e.,g., video, physiology) empowered by machine learning to build an automatic drowsiness detection system. Nevertheless, most of the existing methods are based on complicated wearables (e.,g., electroencephalogram) or computer vision algorithms (e.,g., eye state analysis), which makes the relevant systems hardly applicable in the wild. Furthermore, data based on these methods are insufficient in nature due to limited simulation experiments. In this light, we propose a novel and easily implemented method based on full non-invasive multimodal machine learning analysis for the driver drowsiness detection task. The drowsiness level was estimated by self-reported questionnaire in pre-designed protocols. First, we consider involving environmental data (e.,g., temperature, humidity, illuminance, and further more), which can be regarded as complementary information for the human activity data recorded via accelerometers or actigraphs. Second, we demonstrate that the models trained by daily life data can still be efficient to make predictions for the subject performing in a simulator, which may benefit the future data collection methods. Finally, we make a comprehensive study on investigating different machine learning methods including classic `shallow' models and recent deep models. Experimental results show that, our proposed methods can reach 64.6% unweighted average recall for drowsiness detection in a subject-independent scenario.

The TRCA-based SSVEP method yields lower computational cost and higher classification performance compared to existing SSVEP methods. In spite of its utility, the TRCA-based SSVEP method still suffers from the degradation of the frequency recognition rate in cases where EEG signals with a short length window are used. To address this issue, here, we propose an improved strategy for decoding SSVEPs, which is insensitive to a window length by carrying out two-step TRCA. The proposed method reuses the spatial filters corresponding to target frequencies generated by the TRCA. Followingly, the proposed method accentuates features for target frequencies by correlating individual template and test data. For the evaluation of the performance of the proposed method, we used a benchmark dataset with 35 subjects and confirmed significantly improved performance comparing with other existing SSVEP methods. These results imply the suitability as an efficient frequency recognition strategy for SSVEP-based BCI applications.

The implanted electrodes generally provide a sparse sampling of multiple brain regions, including both cortical and subcortical structures, making the SEEG neural recordings a potential source for the brain-computer interface (BCI) purpose in recent years. For SEEG signals, data cleaning is an essential preprocessing step in removing excessive noises for further analysis. However, little is known about what kinds of effect that different data cleaning methods may exert on BCI decoding performance and, moreover, what are the reasons causing the differentiated effects. To address these questions, we adopted five different data cleaning methods, including common average reference, gray-white matter reference, electrode shaft reference, bipolar reference, and Laplacian reference, to process the SEEG data and evaluated the effect of these methods on improving BCI decoding performance. Additionally, we also comparatively investigated the changes of SEEG signals induced by these different methods from multiple-domain (e.g., spatial, spectral, and temporal domain). The results showed that data cleaning methods could improve the accuracy of gesture decoding, where the Laplacian reference produced the best performance. Further analysis revealed that the superiority of the data cleaning method with excellent performance might be attributed to the increased distinguishability in the low-frequency band. The findings of this work highlighted the importance of applying proper data clean methods for SEEG signals and proposed the application of Laplacian reference for SEEG-based BCI.

J	Wang, MY; Yuan, Z				Wang, Meng-Yun; Yuan, Zhen			EEG Decoding of Dynamic Facial Expressions of Emotion: Evidence from SSVEP and Causal Cortical Network Dynamics	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						SSVEP; dynamic facial expression; granger causality		The neural cognitive mechanism in processing static facial expressions (FEs) has been well documented, whereas the one underlying perceiving dynamic faces remains unclear. In this study, Fourier transformation and time-frequency analysis of Electroencephalography (EEG) data were carried out to detect the brain activation underlying dynamic or static FEs while twenty-one participants were viewing dynamic or static faces flicking at 10 Hz. In particular, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were quantified through spectral power analysis of EEG recordings. Besides, Granger causality (GC) analysis (GCA) was also performed to capture the causal cortical network dynamics during dynamic or static FEs of emotion. It was discovered that the dynamic (from neural to happy (N2H) or vice versa (H2N)) FEs elicited larger SSVEPs than the static ones. Additionally, GCA demonstrated that the H2N case, in which happy FEs were being gradually changed into neutral ones, exhibited larger GC measure during the late processing stage than that from the early stage. Consequently, enhanced SSVEPs and effective brain connectivity for dynamic FEs illustrated that participants might need consume more attentional resources to process the dynamic faces, particularly for the change from happy to neutral faces. The new neural index might facilitate us to better understand the cognitive processing of dynamic and static FEs. (C) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Participants with pathogenic SYNGAP1 variants and available video-electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were recruited within five European epilepsy reference centers. We obtained molecular and clinical data, analyzed EEG recordings and archived video-EEGs of seizures and detailed characteris-tics of interictal and ictal EEG patterns for every patient. Results: We recruited 15 previously unreported patients and analyzed 72 EEGs. Two distinct EEG patterns emerged, both triggered by eye closure. Pattern 1 (14/15 individuals) consisted of rhythmic posterior/dif-fuse delta waves appearing with eye-closure and persisting until eye opening (strongly suggestive of fixation-off sensitivity). Pattern 2 (9/15 individuals) consisted of diffuse polyspike-and-wave discharges triggered by eye closure (eye-closure sensitivity). Both patterns presented in 8/15. Including archived video-EEG clips of seizures from 9/15 patients, we analyzed 254 seizures. Of 224 seizures experienced while awake, 161 (72%) occurred at or following eye closure. In 119/161, pattern 1 preceded an atypical absence, myoclonic seizure or myoclonic absence; in 42/161, pattern 2 was associated with eyelid myoclonia, absences and myoclonic or atonic seizures. Conclusions: Fixation-off and eye closure were the main triggers for seizures in this SYNGAP1 cohort. Significance: Combining these clinical and electroencephalographic features could help guide genetic diagnosis. ? 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Currently, only behavioral speech understanding tests are available, which require active participation of the person being tested. As this is infeasible for certain populations, an objective measure of speech intelligibility is required. Recently, brain imaging data has been used to establish a relationship between stimulus and brain response. Linear models have been successfully linked to speech intelligibility but require per-subject training. We present a deep-learning-based model incorporating dilated convolutions that operates in a match/mismatch paradigm. The accuracy of the model's match/mismatch predictions can be used as a proxy for speech intelligibility without subject-specific (re)training. Approach. We evaluated the performance of the model as a function of input segment length, electroencephalography (EEG) frequency band and receptive field size while comparing it to multiple baseline models. Next, we evaluated performance on held-out data and finetuning. Finally, we established a link between the accuracy of our model and the state-of-the-art behavioral MATRIX test. Main results. The dilated convolutional model significantly outperformed the baseline models for every input segment length, for all EEG frequency bands except the delta and theta band, and receptive field sizes between 250 and 500 ms. Additionally, finetuning significantly increased the accuracy on a held-out dataset. Finally, a significant correlation (r = 0.59, p = 0.0154) was found between the speech reception threshold (SRT) estimated using the behavioral MATRIX test and our objective method. Significance. Our method is the first to predict the SRT from EEG for unseen subjects, contributing to objective measures of speech intelligibility.

In this scale-free system, it is possible to decode the complexity of information processing using fractal behavior. For instance, the complexity of information processing in the brain can be evaluated by fractal dimensions (FDs). However, it is unclear how over-elaboration of information processing impacts the dimensionality of its fractal behavior. In this study, we hypothesized that FDs of electroencephalogram (EEG) in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) should be higher than healthy controls (HCs) because of exaggeration of information processing mainly in the frontal regions. Therefore, a group of 39 OCDs (age: 34.76 +/- 8.22, 25 female, 3 left-handed) and 19 HCs (age: 31.94 +/- 8.22, 11 female, 1 left-handed) were recruited and their brain activities were recorded using a 19-channel EEG recorder in the eyes-open resting-state condition. Subsequently, fractal dimensions of the cleaned EEG data were calculated using Katz's method in a frequency band-specific manner. After the test of normality, significant changes in the OCDs as compared to the HCs were calculated using a two-sample t-test. OCDs showed higher FDs in the frontal regions in all frequency bands as compared to HCs. Although, significant increases were only observed in the beta and lower gamma bands, mainly at the high beta. Interestingly, neurophysiological findings also show association with severity of obsessive behaviors. The results demonstrate that complexity of information processing in the brain follows an intimate nature of structural and functional impairments of the brain in OCD.

Increasing numbers of studies have further attempted to reconstruct the image itself. However, because images of objects and scenes inherently involve spatial layout information, the reconstruction usually requires retinotopically organized neural data with high spatial resolution, such as fMRI signals. In contrast, spatial layout does not matter in the perception of "texture," which is known to be represented as spatially global image statistics in the visual cortex. This property of "texture" enables us to reconstruct the perceived image from EEG signals, which have a low spatial resolution. Here, we propose an MVAE-based approach for reconstructing texture images from visual evoked potentials measured from observers viewing natural textures such as the textures of various surfaces and object ensembles. This approach allowed us to reconstruct images that perceptually resemble the original textures with a photographic appearance. The present approach can be used as a method for decoding the highly detailed "impression" of sensory stimuli from brain activity.

J	Wang, QX; Wang, H; Hu, F; Hua, CC; Wang, DX				Wang, Qiaoxiu; Wang, Hong; Hu, Fo; Hua, Chengcheng; Wang, Dangxiao			Using convolutional neural networks to decode EEG-based functional brain network with different severity of acrophobia	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						acrophobia; functional connectivity; EEG; CNN; virtual reality		Objective. The prevalence of acrophobia is high, especially with the rise of many high-rise buildings. In the recent few years, researchers have begun to analyze acrophobia from the neuroscience perspective, especially to improve the virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). Electroencephalographic (EEG) is an informative neuroimaging technique, but it is rarely used for acrophobia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using EEGs to identify the degree of acrophobia objectively. Approach. EEG data were collected by virtual reality (VR) exposure experiments. We classified all subjects' degrees of acrophobia into three categories, where their questionnaire scores and behavior data showed significant differences. Using synchronization likelihood, we computed the functional connectivity between each pair of channels and then obtained complex networks named functional brain networks (FBNs). Basic topological features and community structure features were extracted from the FBNs. Statistical results demonstrated that FBN features can be used to distinguish different groups of subjects. We trained machine learning (ML) algorithms with FBN features as inputs and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with FBNs directly as inputs. Main results. It turns out that using FBN to identify the severity of acrophobia is feasible. For ML algorithms, the community structure features of some cerebral cortex regions outperform typical topological features of the whole brain, in terms of classification accuracy. The performances of CNN algorithms are better than ML algorithms. The CNN with ResNet performs the best (accuracy reached 98.46 +/- 0.42%). Significance. These observations indicate that community structures of certain cerebral cortex regions could be used to identify the degree of acrophobia. The proposed CNN framework can provide objective feedback, which could help build closed-loop VRET portable systems.

Until now, most of the studies focused on the diagnosis of a particular psychological disorder using EEG. We propose a generic approach to diagnose the different type of psychological disorders with high accuracy. The proposed approach is tested on five different datasets and three psychological disorders. Electrodes having higher signal to noise ratio are selected from the raw EEG signals. Multiple linear and non-linear features are then extracted from the selected electrodes. After feature selection, machine learning is used to diagnose the psychological disorders. We kept the same generic approach for all the datasets and diseases and achieved 93%, 85% and 80% F1 score on Schizophrenia, Epilepsy and Parkinson disease, respectively.

In this paper, a novel experimental paradigm was designed to imagine two motions of unilateral upper limb, which is hand gripping and releasing, and elbow reciprocating left and right. During this experiment, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were collected from 10 subjects. The time and frequency domains of the EEG signals were analyzed and visualized, indicating the presence of different Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) or Event-Related Synchronization (ERS) for the two tasks. Then the two tasks were classified through three different EEG decoding methods, in which the optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) based on FBCNet achieved an average accuracy of 67.8%, obtaining a good recognition result. This work not only can advance the studies of MI decoding of unilateral upper limb, but also can provide a basis for better upper limb stroke rehabilitation in MI-BCI.

This technology can meet the control requirements of external equipment without passing through the patient's damaged nerves and declining muscle system. Electroencephalogram (EEG) contains a variety of information, including motor imagination information, steady-state visually evoked EEG information, emotional information, and fatigue information, etc. This paper designs a brain-computer interface system based on motor imagination and uses it to control the body movements of the NAO robot. The system is mainly divided into three modules: signal acquisition, signal processing and robot control. In terms of signal acquisition, electrode caps, conductive glue, EEG amplifiers and Curry7 software are used. In this paper, we design a frequency band feature selection algorithm based on an improved sub-band filter bank (FB)-Common Space Pattern (CSP). These features are classified using Bagging ensemble classification algorithm and converted to use Commands for controlling the NAO robot. In terms of communication control, the instruction codes are preset, and the classification results are corresponding to instructions for controlling different actions of the robot. It is transmitted to the robot by using wireless communication technology. The Bagging ensemble classification method proposed in this paper classifies EEG features. The accuracy of the four types of motor imaging EEG classification is as high as 78.29%, and the accuracy of NAO robot action execution experiments is up to 86.33%, which proves the correctness of the algorithm studied in this paper.

Neurofeedback for cognitive enhancement and intervention and brain plasticity	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Brain machine interfaces; Decoding; Cognitive training; Plasticity; Rehabiliation; Learning; EEG; FMRI; ADHD	REAL-TIME FMRI; LEARNING-DISABLED CHILDREN; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION; EFFICACY; SHAM	In recent years, neurofeedback has been used as a cognitive training tool to improve brain functions for clinical or recreational purposes. It is based on providing participants with feedback about their brain activity and training them to control it, initiating directional changes. The overarching hypothesis behind this method is that this control results in an enhancement of the cognitive abilities associated with this brain activity, and triggers specific structural and functional changes in the brain, promoted by learning and neuronal plasticity effects. Here, we review the general methodological principles behind neurofeedback and we describe its behavioural benefits in clinical and experimental contexts. We review the non-specific effects of neurofeedback on the reinforcement learning striatofrontal networks as well as the more specific changes in the cortical networks on which the neurofeedback control is exerted. Last, we analyse the current challenges faces by neurofeedback studies, including the quantification of the temporal dynamics of neurofeedback effects, the generalisation of its behavioural outcomes to everyday life situations, the design of appropriate controls to disambiguate placebo from true neurofeedback effects and the development of more advanced cortical signal processing to achieve a finer-grained realtime modelling of cognitive functions.

However, existing tools for TBI diagnosis are either subjective or require extensive clinical setup and expertise. The increasing affordability and reduction in the size of relatively high-performance computing systems combined with promising results from TBI related machine learning research make it possible to create compact and portable systems for early detection of TBI. This work describes a Raspberry Pi based portable, real-time data acquisition, and automated processing system that uses machine learning to efficiently identify TBI and automatically score sleep stages from a single-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. We discuss the design, implementation, and verification of the system that can digitize the EEG signal using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and perform real-time signal classification to detect the presence of mild TBI (mTBI). We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost based predictive models to evaluate the performance and demonstrate the versatility of the system to operate with multiple types of predictive models. We achieve a peak classification accuracy of more than 90% with a classification time of less than 1 s across 16-64 s epochs for TBI vs. control conditions. This work can enable the development of systems suitable for field use without requiring specialized medical equipment for early TBI detection applications and TBI research. Further, this work opens avenues to implement connected, real-time TBI related health and wellness monitoring systems.

J	Khalili, E; Asl, BM				Khalili, Ebrahim; Asl, Babak Mohammadzadeh			Automatic Sleep Stage Classification Using Temporal Convolutional Neural Network and New Data Augmentation Technique from Raw Single-Channel EEG	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Sleep stage classification; Single channel EEG; Deep learning; Temporal Convolutional Neural Network; Data augmentation	MODEL; RESOURCE	Background and objective: This paper presents a new framework for automatic classification of sleep stages using a deep learning algorithm from single-channel EEG signals. Each segmented EEG signal appended with its label of stages is fed into a deep learning model to create an automatic sleep stage classification. This is one of the most important problems that is critical to the realization of monitoring patients with sleep disorder. Methods: In the present study, a neural network architecture is introduced utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract features, followed by Temporal Convolutional Neural Network to extract the temporal features from the extracted features vector of CNN. Finally, the performance of our model is improved by a Conditional Random Field layer. We also employed a new data augmentation technique to enhance the CNNs training which has auxiliary effects. Results: We evaluated our model by two different single-channel EEG signals (i.e., Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz EEG channels) from two public sleep datasets, named Sleep-EDF-2013 and Sleep-EDF-2018. The evaluation results on both datasets showed that our model obtains the best total accuracy and kappa score (EDF2013: 85.39%-0.80, EDF-2018: 82.46%-0.76) compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: This study will possibly allow us to have a wearable sleep monitoring system with a single channel EEG. Also, unlike hand-crafted features methods, our model finds its own patterns through training epochs, and therefore, it may minimize engineering bias. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF DEFENSE MODELING AND SIMULATION-APPLICATIONS METHODOLOGY TECHNOLOGY-JDMS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; EEG; team neurodynamics; information; machine learning		Uncertainty is a fundamental property of neural computation that becomes amplified when sensory information does not match a person's expectations of the world. Uncertainty and hesitation are often early indicators of potential disruption, and the ability to rapidly measure uncertainty would have implications for future educational and training efforts by targeting reflective discussions about past actions, supporting in-progress corrections, and generating forecasts about future disruptions. An approach is described combining neurodynamics and machine learning to provide quantitative measures of uncertainty. Models of neurodynamic information derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) brainwaves have provided detailed neurodynamic histories of US Navy submarine navigation team members. Persistent periods (25-30 s) of neurodynamic information were seen as discrete peaks when establishing the submarine's position and were identified as periods of uncertainty by an artificial intelligence (AI) system previously trained to recognize the frequency, magnitude, and duration of different patterns of uncertainty in healthcare and student teams. Transition matrices of neural network states closely predicted the future uncertainty of the navigation team during the three minutes prior to a grounding event. These studies suggest that the dynamics of uncertainty may have common characteristics across teams and tasks and that forecasts of their short-term evolution can be estimated.

J	Bayet, L; Saville, A; Balas, B				Bayet, Laurie; Saville, Alyson; Balas, Benjamin			Sensitivity to face animacy and inversion in childhood: Evidence from EEG data	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Animacy; Face recognition; ERPs; Experience; Children; MVPA	OWN-RACE BIAS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ERP EVIDENCE; AGE BIAS; PERCEPTION; ACCOUNT; N170; IDENTIFICATION; REPRESENTATION; COMPONENTS	Adults exhibit relative behavioral difficulties in processing inanimate, artificial faces compared to real human faces, with implications for using artificial faces in research and designing artificial social agents. However, the developmental trajectory of inanimate face perception is unknown. To address this gap, we used electroencephalography to investigate inanimate faces processing in cross-sectional groups of 5-10-year-old children and adults. A face inversion manipulation was used to test whether face animacy processing relies on expert face processing strategies. Groups of 5-7-year-olds (N = 18), 8-10-year-olds (N = 18), and adults (N = 16) watched pictures of real or doll faces presented in an upright or inverted orientation. Analyses of event-related potentials revealed larger N170 amplitudes in response to doll faces, irrespective of age group or face orientation. Thus, the N170 is sensitive to face animacy by 5-7 years of age, but such sensitivity may not reflect high-level, expert face processing. Multivariate pattern analyses of the EEG signal additionally assessed whether animacy information could be reliably extracted during face processing. Face orientation, but not face animacy, could be reliably decoded from occipitotemporal channels in children and adults. Face animacy could be decoded from whole scalp channels in adults, but not children. Together, these results suggest that 5-10-year-old children exhibit some sensitivity to face animacy over occipitotemporal regions that is comparable to adults.

A first-rate and deep sleep is required for green regeneration of the body. Sleep disorders hamper the performance of an individual. Sleep Apnea is the one amongst the disorders that affect many. Most of Apnea related works consider Electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals /or combinations, instead of considering all Polysomnographic signals (PSG). It is evident that for the detection of Apnea related sleep disorders it is required to consider one or few signals rather considering all PSG signals. In this work, we advocate a way that might be carried out to perceive the information of sleep stages which might be crucial in diagnosing and treating sleep disorders. It differentiates sleep stages and derives new features from the sleep EEG that allows helping physicians with the analysis and treatment of associated sleep issues. This theory depends on exclusive EEG datasets from Physionet with the use of MIT-BIH polysomnographic database that have been received and described through scientists for the analysis and prognosis of sleep ranges. Experimental results on 18 records with 10197 epochs show that an Apnea detection accuracy of 95.9% obtained for Machine learning classifier with Ensemble Bagged Tree classifier.

The brain age index (BAI) is a machine learning model that quantifies deviations in brain activity during sleep relative to healthy individuals of the same age. High BAI was previously found to be associated with neurological, psychiatric, cardiometabolic diseases, and reduced life expectancy among people without HIV. Here, we estimated the effect of HIV infection on BAI by comparing PLWH and HIV- controls. Methods: Clinical data and sleep EEGs from 43 PLWH on antiretroviral therapy (HIV+) and 3,155 controls (HIV-) were collected from Massachusetts General Hospital. The effect of HIV infection on BAI, and on individual EEG features, was estimated using causal inference. Results: The average effect of HIV on BAI was estimated to be +3.35 years (p < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.67, 5.92]) using doubly robust estimation. Compared to HIV- controls, HIV+ participants exhibited a reduction in delta band power during deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Conclusion: We provide causal evidence that HIV contributes to advanced brain aging reflected in sleep EEG. A better understanding is greatly needed of potential therapeutic targets to mitigate the effect of HIV on brain health, potentially including sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease	[Leone, Michael J.; Sun, Haoqi; Boutros, Christine L.; Ye, Elissa; Sullivan, Lee; Robbins, Gregory K.; Mukerji, Shibani S.; Westover, M.

Development of Low complexity detection algorithms is needed in order to design efficient automatic epilepsy detection devices. In this paper, an automatic seizure detection algorithm proposed using Discrete Wavelet Transform and Cluster-based Nearest Neighborhood machine learning algorithm. The Electroencephalogram signals decomposed by Daubechies Wavelet transform. Temporal features extracted from decomposed Wavelet sub-bands. A new distance-based feature selection method introduced for an optimal feature selection. The proposed Cluster-based KNN algorithm reduces the number of computations required for conventional KNN method. The performance of proposed algorithm is validated by publically available benchmark EEG database. This proposed Classification method obtained 100% accuracy between seizure and normal EEG signals; 98% of accuracy between Inter-ictal and seizure signals, 91% of accuracy between Normal and Inter-ictal signals. This proposed cluster nearest neighborhood classifier requires less number of training samples and less number of calculation steps to detect seizure events. The analysis on classification performance between the various frequency bands confirms that, the EEG signal frequency band of 2.6-5.5 Hz reveals better classification results in adults. Due to less complexity of algorithm, the proposed algorithm is well suited for hardware implementation of automatic seizure detection systems.

MI-EEG signals of large limbs movements have been explored in recent researches because they deliver relevant classification rates for BCI systems. However, smaller and noisy signals corresponding to hand-finger imagined movements are less frequently used because they are difficult to classify. This study proposes a method for decoding finger imagined movements of the right hand. For this purpose, MI-EEG signals from C3, Cz, P3, and Pz sensors were carefully selected to be processed in the proposed framework. Therefore, a method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to tackle the problem of noisy signals. At the same time, the sequence classification is performed by a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. The proposed method was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation on a public dataset, obtaining an accuracy of 82.26%.

Stimulus-induced EEG-patterns and outcome after cardiac arrest	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						Cardiac arrest; EEG; SIRPIDs; Prognosis; Coma	TARGETED TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT; ICTAL DISCHARGES SIRPIDS; NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; 33-DEGREES-C; SOCIETY; COMA	Objective: EEG is commonly used to predict prognosis in post anoxic coma. We investigated if stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) add prognostic information after cardiac arrest. Methods: In the multicenter Targeted Temperature Management trial, routine-EEGs were prospectively recorded after rewarming (>= 36 h). Presence and subtype of SIRPIDs and main EEG-pattern (benign, malignant, highly malignant) were retrospectively reported according to a standardised classification. Patients were followed up after 180 days. Poor outcome was defined as severe neurological disability or death (Cerebral Performance Category 3-5). Results: Of 142 patients, 71% had poor outcome and 14% had SIRPIDs. There was no significant difference in outcome between patients with and without SIRPIDs, even when subgrouped according to underlying main EEG-pattern. Comparing subtypes of SIRPIDs, 82% of patients with stimulus-induced periodic discharges had poor outcome compared to 44% of patients with stimulus-induced rhythmic delta activity, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions: In EEGs performed >36 h after cardiac arrest, SIRPIDs cannot be used to reliably predict poor outcome. Whether certain subtypes of SIRPIDs indicate worse prognosis needs further investigation.

Thus, accurate measures of professional interest, an aspect of personality according to vocational theories, are necessary. There is empirical evidence supporting personality prediction using biometric signals. Therefore, professional interest may be estimated similarly. The objective of this study was to generate a machine learning algorithm based on physiological data of children performing engineering-related activities that estimated their professional interest in engineering subfields. Thirteen children between 6 and 15 years old participated. Using eight electroencephalographic channels, we measured electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, facial gestures, and body temperature in four 2-hour sessions as the children performed engineering-related educational activities. Psychometric tests evaluated their interest in specific engineering subfields per the activities. We processed the generated data to design a machine learning algorithm, which resulted in 80% precision in detecting the change in interest. The results indicate that a pattern for change in engineering interest exists and can be measured.

However, the human factor may cause erroneous diagnosis in the analysis of the EEG signal. In the past 2 decades, many advanced signal processing and machine learning methods have been developed for the detection of epileptic seizures. However, many of these methods require large data sets and complex operations. Methods: In this study, an end-to-end machine learning model is presented for detection of epileptic seizure using the pretrained deep two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and the concept of transfer learning. The EEG signal is converted directly into visual data with a spectrogram and used directly as input data. Results: The authors analyzed the results of the training of the proposed pretrained AlexNet CNN model. Both binary and ternary classifications were performed without any extra procedure such as feature extraction. By performing data set creation from short-term spectrogram graphic images, the authors were able to achieve 100% accuracy for binary classification for epileptic seizure detection and 100% for ternary classification. Discussion/Conclusion: The proposed automatic identification and classification model can help in the early diagnosis of epilepsy, thus providing the opportunity for effective early treatment.

Recently, BCIs, and wearable computers in particular, have been receiving more attention by government and industry as an alternative means of interacting with technology. Wearable computers can combine highly immersive virtual/augmented/mixed reality experiences for entertainment, health monitoring, utilitarian purposes, and, most importantly at present, research. With wearable computers, researchers can design, simulate, and finely control experiments to examine human-brain dynamics outside the laboratory. Yet despite the power of BCIs, take-up is slow. This form of interaction is unnatural to humans and often requires external stimuli. Further, the response feedback produced by the computer part of the system is nowhere near as quick as our brains. Hence, we undertook a review of the current state-of-the-art in BCI research and distilled the current findings into a stimulus-free BCI, called direct-sense BCIs, that operates directly and seamlessly from our thinking. This is a novel paradigm that, in the short term, could substantially improve the quality of a user's experience with BCI, and, over the long term, lead to much more widespread take-up of BCI technology.

Thus, the implementation of machine-learning algorithms for medical applications is growing, enabling doctors to make decisions based on the output of the model of the system?s behavior. The upper airway is involved in a variety of disorders that lead to non-specific symptoms; thus, upper-airway obstruction is frequently unrecognized or misdiagnosed. Bronchoscopy, which is a minimally invasive procedure, and lung function (spirometry) tests, which are relatively demanding for the patient, are currently the most common methods for diagnosing respiratory diseases. In this study, a novel, non-invasive procedure is proposed in which tracheal obstruction is identified based on brain signals. Specifically, the spectral information in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is used as an input to an ensemble learner approach based on ordinal and non-ordinal classification algorithms, where the classification problem involves identifying the degree of airway obstruction. An experiment was conducted in which four healthy subjects breathed through three-dimensional (3D) geometric models of the trachea that mimicked different obstruction rates. Multi-subject classification was carried out in which the classification model of each subject was produced by training the model on the other subjects? datasets. The main findings were as follows. Firstly, the in-house ordinal classification algorithms, which included a C4.5 and a random-forest algorithm, both based on a weighted information-gain ratio measure, yielded better classification results than their non-ordinal counterparts and other conventional classifiers. Additionally, the study showed that when integrating the two types of algorithms (ordinal and non-ordinal) into an ensemble approach, the performance was improved relative to each individual classifier. Finally, the classification accuracy is such that the proposed method of using EEG signals for the identification of the degree of tracheal obstruction by means of an ensemble approach shows promise as a supplemental clinical test.

Use of artificial intelligence on Electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms to predict failure in early school grades in children from a rural cohort in Pakistan	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PROGRAM; POWER	Universal primary education is critical for individual academic growth and overall adult productivity of nations. Estimates indicate that 25% of 59 million primary age out of school children drop out and early grade failure is one of the factors. An objective and feasible screening measure to identify at-risk children in the early grades can help to design appropriate interventions. The objective of this study was to use a Machine Learning algorithm to evaluate the power of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected at age 4 in predicting academic achievement at age 8 among rural children in Pakistan. Demographic and EEG data from 96 children of a cohort along with their academic achievement in grade 1-2 measured using an academic achievement test of Math and language at the age of 7-8 years was used to develop the machine learning algorithm. K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier was used on different model combinations of EEG, sociodemographic and home environment variables. KNN model was evaluated using 5 Stratified Folds based on the sensitivity and specificity. In the current dataset, 55% and 74% failed in the mathematics and language test respectively. On testing data across each fold, the mean sensitivity and specificity was calculated. Sensitivity was similar when EEG variables were combined with sociodemographic, and home environment (Math = 58.7%, Language = 66.3%) variables but specificity improved (Math = 43.4% to 50.6% and Language = 32% to 60%). The model requires further validation for EEG to be used as a screening measure with adequate sensitivity and specificity to identify children in their preschool age who may be at high risk of failure in early grades.

Many studies have reported on the classification performance of motor imagery to decode individual fingers in stroke patients compared with healthy controls. However, classification performance for a given limb is still low because the differences between patients owing to brain reorganization after stroke are not considered. We used electroencephalography signals from eleven healthy controls and eleven stroke patients in this study. The subjects performed a finger tapping task during motor execution, and motor imagery was performed with the dominant and affected hands in the healthy controls and stroke patients, respectively. All fingers except for the thumb were classified using the proposed framework based on a voting module. The averaged four-class accuracies during motor execution and motor imagery were 53.16 +/- 8.42% and 46.94 +/- 5.99% for the healthy controls and 53.17 +/- 14.09% and 66.00 +/- 14.96% for the stroke patients, respectively. Importantly, the classification accuracies in the stroke patients were statistically higher than those in healthy controls during motor imagery. However, there was no significant difference between the accuracies of motor execution and motor imagery. These findings show the potential for high classification performance for a given limb during motor imagery in stroke patients. These results can also provide insights into controlling an external device on the basis of a brain-computer interface.

EEG signals are highly irregular, nonlinear, and nonstationary in nature and are traditionally studied from a linear viewpoint by means of statistical and frequency features. Since, linear metrics present certain limitations and nonlinear methods have proven to be an efficient tool in understanding the complexities of the brain in the identification of underlying behavior of biological signals, such as electrocardiogram, EEG and magnetoencephalogram and thus, can be applied to all nonstationary signals. Various nonlinear algorithms can be used in the analysis of EEG signals. In this research paper, we aim to develop a novel methodology for EEG-based depression diagnosis utilizing 2 advanced computational techniques: frequency-domain extended multivariate autoregressive (eMVAR) and deep learning (DL). We proposed a hybrid method comprising a pretrained ResNet-50 and long-short term memory (LSTM) to capture depression-specific information and compared with a strong conventional machine learning (ML) framework having eMVAR connectivity features. The following 8 causality measures, which interpret the interaction mechanisms among spectrally decomposed oscillations, were used to extract features from multivariate EEG time series: directed coherence (DC), directed transfer function (DTF), partial DC (PDC), generalized PDC (gPDC), extended DC (eDC), delayed DC (dDC), extended PDC (ePDC), and delayed PDC (dPDC). The classification accuracies were 84% with DC, 85% with DTF, 95.3% with PDC, 95.1% with gPDC, 84.8% with eDC, 84.6% with dDC, 84.2% with ePDC, and 95.9% with dPDC for the eMVAR framework. Through a DL framework (ResNet-50 + LSTM), the classification accuracy was achieved as 90.22%. The results demonstrate that our DL methodology is a competitive alternative to the strong feature extraction-based ML methods in depression classification.

The emergence of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation-Electroencephalogram (TMS-EEG) enables noninvasive neurophysiological investi-gation of the human cortex, which might be potentially used for CI detection.Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore whether the spatiotemporal features of TMS Evoked Potentials (TEPs) could classify CI from healthy controls (HC).Methods: Twenty-one patients with CI and 22 HC underwent a single-pulse TMS-EEG stimulus in which the pulses were delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left DLPFC). After preprocessing, seven regions of interest (ROIs) and two most reliable TEPs' components: N100 and P200 were selected. Next, seven simple and interpretable linear features of TEPs were extracted for each region, three common machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were used to detect CI. Meanwhile, data augmentation and voting strategy were used for a more robust model. Finally, the performance differences of features in classifiers and their contributions were investigated.Results: 1. In the time domain, the features of N100 had the best performance in the SVM classifier, with an accuracy of 88.37%. 2. In the aspect of spatiality, the features of the right frontal region and left parietal region had the best performance in the SVM classifier, with an accuracy of 83.72%. 3. The Local Mean Field Power (LMFP), Average Value (AVG), Latency and Amplitude contributed most in classification.Conclusions: The TEPs induced by TMS over the left DLPFC has significant differences spatially and temporally between CI and HC. Machine learning based on the spatiotemporal features of TEPs have the ability to separate the CI and HC which suggest that TEPs has potential as non-invasive biomarkers for CI diagnosis.

J	Cherloo, MN; Amiri, HK; Daliri, MR				Cherloo, Mohammad Norizadeh; Amiri, Homa Kashefi; Daliri, Mohammad Reza			Ensemble Regularized Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (ensemble RCSSP) model for motor imagery-based EEG signal classification	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalogram; Motor imagery; Common spatial patterns; Ensemble learning; Bagging; Decision tree	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SELECTION; FILTERS	The Brain-Computer interface system provides a communication path among the brain and computer, and recently, it is the subject of increasing attention. One of the most common paradigms of BCI systems is motor imagery. Currently, to classify motor imagery EEG signals, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) are extensively used. Generally, the recorded motor imagery EEG signals in BCI are noisy, non-stationary, thus significantly reducing the BCI system's performance. It is shown that the CSP algorithm has a good performance in the classification of various types of motor imagery data. However, once the number of trials is low, or the data are noisy, overfitting will probably occur, which precludes extracting an appropriate spatial filter. Another drawback of the CSP is that it only extracts spatial-based filters. Therefore, the current study attempts to decrease the probability of overfitting in the CSP algorithm by presenting an improved method called Ensemble Regularized Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (Ensemble RCSSP). Compared with other CSP and improved versions of CSP algorithms, our proposed models indicate a better accuracy, robustness, and reliability for motor imagery EEG data. The performance of the proposed Ensemble RCSSP has been tested for BCI Competition IV, Dataset 1, and BCI Competition III, Dataset Iva. Compared with other methods, performance is improved, and on average, the accuracy for all subjects is reached to 82.64% and 86.91% for the first and second datasets, respectively.

Despite a wealth of studies at high anatomic resolution, the exact neural signals for the timing of pain remain little known. Identifying the onset of pain signals from distributed cortical circuits may reveal the temporal dynamics of pain responses and subsequently provide important feedback for closed-loop neuromodulation for pain. New method: Here we developed an unsupervised learning method for sequential detection of acute pain signals based on multichannel human EEG recordings. Following EEG source localization, we used a state-space model (SSM) to detect the onset of acute pain signals based on the localized regions of interest (ROIs). Results: We validated the SSM-based detection strategy using two human EEG datasets, including one public EEG recordings of 50 subjects. We found that the detection accuracy varied across tested subjects and detection methods. We also demonstrated the feasibility for cross-subject and cross-modality prediction of detecting the acute pain signals. Comparison with existing methods: In contrast to the batch supervised learning analysis based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the unsupervised learning method requires fewer number of training trials in the online experiment, and shows comparable or improved performance than the supervised method. Conclusions: Our unsupervised SSM-based method combined with EEG source localization showed robust performance in detecting the onset of acute pain signals.

Firstly, we select the fixed frequency of signals ranging from 8 to 30 Hz. Secondly, multiple spatial filters are constructed by using the one versus the rest common spatial pattern (OVR-CSP) and extract the feature vectors. Support vector machine (SVM) is employed to classify the feature vectors so that the best spatial filter is selected. We build the first branch of decision tree with the spatial filter selected and SVM. Then, OVR-CSP and SVM are used to build the branches of the decision tree repeatedly. Finally, 2005 BCI competition IIIa data set is used to validate the effect of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the highest accuracy of the proposed algorithm can reach 94.27% which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm.

These measurements are undertaken to prevent death and disability due to stroke. We compare the various characteristics, such as weight, accessibility, frequency of use, data continuity, and response time of these wearables. It was found that the most user-friendly wearables can have limitations in reporting high-precision prediction outcomes. Therefore, we report also the trend of integrating these wearables into the internet of things (IoT) and combining electronic health records (EHRs) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to establish a stroke risk prediction system. Due to different characteristics, such as accessibility, time, and spatial resolution of various wearable-based technologies, strategies of applying different types of wearables to maximize the efficacy of stroke risk prediction are also reported. In addition, based on the various applications of multimodal electroencephalography-functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) on stroke patients, the perspective of using this technique to improve the prediction performance is elaborated. Expected prediction has to be dynamically delivered with high-precision outcomes. There is a need for stroke risk stratification and management to reduce the resulting social and economic burden.

Reconstructed phase space portraits for detecting brain diseases using deep learning	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; RPS portrait; Reconstructed phase space; Convolutional neural network; EEG; Brain diseases	EEG SIGNALS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SLEEP; CLASSIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYSTEM; MODEL	Background and objective Abnormalities in the brain affect its functions, and is observed among people of all background. Automatic identification of these abnormalities will assist treatment. These abnormalities are observable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal which measures the electrical activity of the brain. The EEG signal is nonlinear and chaotic in nature. Automatic detection of certain diseases affecting the brain has been attempted using the spatial and temporal characteristics of the EEG employing signal processing, image processing and machine learning techniques. We propose the automatic identification of the abnormalities in the brain based on the depiction of its nonlinear chaotic nature. Methods Accurate detection across multiple brain diseases is a far more challenging problem given the dynamic nature of the EEG signal. We employ Reconstructed Phase Space (RPS) portraits to model these nonlinear dynamics. The EEG signal analysis of short segments results in RPS portraits that implicitly capture the dynamics. In this study, we examine the performance of CNN-based deep learning models as feature extractors from RPS portraits of EEG signals in achieving an improved screening of brain diseases, by classifying them as normal or diseased. Results The use of CNN architectures like Inception-v4 results in high accuracy (97.30%) in the identification of brain diseases (Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, and Sleep Disorder). A further improvement (98.44 +/- 1.5%) in the disease identification is achieved using a voting classifier. Conclusions The non-linear dynamics and CNNs for learning salient features suitable for accurately identifying the brain disease in an end-to-end system is a novel contribution of this study. The high performance of the system makes it feasible to study its utility as a diagnostic support tool.	[Ilakiyaselvan, N.; Khan, A.

Fifteen healthy subjects performed six functional movements of single upper limb: forearm pmnation/supination, hand open/close, and elbow flexion/extension. The wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) was used to decompose MI EEG into sub-bands, and the statistical features were extracted from the sub-bands to code the functional movements. Subsequently, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to select the best feature vector. The factors of mother wavelet, multidimensional wavelet function, number of channels, and the time of imaging segment were optimized through experiments. As a result, the best accuracy of 86.27 +/- 6.98% was achieved with the optimized coif1 mother wavelet with a six-level decomposition, Mexican Hat wavelet as a hyperparameter, the time of imaging segment set as 0.7 s, and 61 channels data. In addition, to further verify the efficiency of the WNN classifier, the comparative experiments were conducted with the support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and single hidden layer feedforward neural network (ANN). The results show that the accuracy of WNN is improved by about 15 similar to 40%, which proved the effectiveness of the WNN method. This study provides a new way to decode from motor imagery EEG in multi-movement classification.

The feature extraction process starts from an initial set of signals acquired by electrodes of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The proposed architecture includes the design and implementation of a functional six Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) prosthetic hand. A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) translates electroencephalography (EEG) signals into movements in the prosthesis. We also propose a new technique for selecting and grouping electrodes, which is related to the motor intentions of the subject. We analyzed and predicted two imaginary motor-intention tasks: opening and closing both fists and flexing and extending both feet.

Currently, anatomical measures, as well as invasive intraoperative electrophysiological recordings, are used to locate DBS electrodes. The objective of this study was to find an alternative electrophysiology tool for STN DBS lead localization. Methods: Sixty-one postoperative electrophysiology recording sessions were obtained from 17 DBS-treated patients with PD. An intraoperative physiological method automatically detected STN borders and subregions. Postoperative EEG cortical activity was measured, while STN low frequency stimulation (LFS) was applied to different areas inside and outside the STN. Machine learning models were used to differentiate stimulation locations, based on EEG analysis of engineered features. Results: A machine learning algorithm identified the top 25 evoked response potentials (ERPs), engineered features that can differentiate inside and outside STN stimulation locations as well as within STN stimulation locations. Evoked responses in the medial and ipsilateral fronto-central areas were found to be most significant for predicting the location of STN stimulation. Two-class linear support vector machine (SVM) predicted the inside (dorso-lateral region, DLR, and ventro-medial region, VMR) vs. outside [zona incerta, ZI, STN stimulation classification with an accuracy of 0.98 and 0.82 for ZI vs. VMR and ZI vs. DLR, respectively, and an accuracy of 0.77 for the within STN (DLR vs. VMR)]. Multiclass linear SVM predicted all areas with an accuracy of 0.82 for the outside and within STN stimulation locations (ZI vs. DLR vs. VMR). Conclusions: Electroencephalogram biomarkers can use low-frequency STN stimulation to localize STN DBS electrodes to ZI, DLR, and VMR STN subregions. These models can be used for both intraoperative electrode localization and postoperative stimulation programming sessions, and have a potential to improve STN DBS clinical outcomes.

Herein, spectrally detailed wavelet scalograms (WSs), derived from the 1024Hz sampled electroencephalograms (EEG) of preterm fetal sheep after HI (n=7), are infused into a high-performance deep convolutional neural network (CNN) pattern classifier to identify high-frequency spike transient biomarkers. The deep WS-CNN pattern classifier identifies EEG spikes with remarkable accuracy of 99.81=0.15% (area under curve, AUC=1.000), cross-validated across 5010 EEG waveforms, during the first 6h post-HI (42h total), an important clinical period for diagnosis of HI brain injury. Further, a feature-fusion strategy is introduced to extract the spectrally dominant features of the raw EEG epochs to form robust 3D input matrix sets to be infused into the deep 2D-CNNs for pattern classification. The results show that the proposed WS-CNN approach is less sensitive to the potential morphological variations of spikes across all subjects compared to other deep CNNs and spectral-fuzzy classifiers, allowing the user to flexibly choose an approach depending on their computational requirements. Collectively, the data provide a reliable framework that could help support well-timed diagnosis of at-risk neonates in clinical practice.

Classification of sleep stages help in understanding sleep related issues. Manual analysis of sleep scoring is costly, tedious and time-consuming process. It is essential to design an automatic sleep scoring technique which is convenient to patients and simplifies the diagnostic process using EEG signals. Implementation of such technique enable experts to identify sleep related issues. In this paper, EEG signals are recorded for 60 subjects and preprocessed using Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter. Sleep stages are classified into three major stages viz stage 1, 2 and 3 with 10 s epoch duration using statistical features of EEG and machine learning algorithms with five-fold cross validation. Proposed method is more feasible for physicians to diagnose sleep disorders and proves to be the better technique with improved accuracy compared to other existing studies.

Scientists and physicians have developed various tools to assess the level of mental stress in its early stages. Several neuroimaging tools have been proposed in the literature to assess mental stress in the workplace. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is one important candidate because it contains rich information about mental states and condition. In this paper, we review the existing EEG signal analysis methods on the assessment of mental stress. The review highlights the critical differences between the research findings and argues that variations of the data analysis methods contribute to several contradictory results. The variations in results could be due to various factors including lack of standardized protocol, the brain region of interest, stressor type, experiment duration, proper EEG processing, feature extraction mechanism, and type of classifier. Therefore, the significant part related to mental stress recognition is choosing the most appropriate features. In particular, a complex and diverse range of EEG features, including time-varying, functional, and dynamic brain connections, requires integration of various methods to understand their associations with mental stress. Accordingly, the review suggests fusing the cortical activations with the connectivity network measures and deep learning approaches to improve the accuracy of mental stress level assessment.

Machine learning of EEG spectra classifies unconsciousness during GABAergic anesthesia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BISPECTRAL INDEX; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM SIGNATURES; POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM; NITROUS-OXIDE; PROPOFOL; AWARENESS; KETAMINE; RECOVERY	In current anesthesiology practice, anesthesiologists infer the state of unconsciousness without directly monitoring the brain. Drug- and patient-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness have been identified previously. We applied machine learning approaches to construct classification models for real-time tracking of unconscious state during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. We used cross-validation to select and train the best performing models using 33,159 2s segments of EEG data recorded from 7 healthy volunteers who received increasing infusions of propofol while responding to stimuli to directly assess unconsciousness. Cross-validated models of unconsciousness performed very well when tested on 13,929 2s EEG segments from 3 left-out volunteers collected under the same conditions (median volunteer AUCs 0.99-0.99). Models showed strong generalization when tested on a cohort of 27 surgical patients receiving solely propofol collected in a separate clinical dataset under different circumstances and using different hardware (median patient AUCs 0.95-0.98), with model predictions corresponding with actions taken by the anesthesiologist during the cases. Performance was also strong for 17 patients receiving sevoflurane (alone or in addition to propofol) (median AUCs 0.88-0.92). These results indicate that EEG spectral features can predict unconsciousness, even when tested on a different anesthetic that acts with a similar neural mechanism. With high performance predictions of unconsciousness, we can accurately monitor anesthetic state, and this approach may be used to engineer infusion pumps to intelligibly respond to patients' neural activity.

In the study, eye-tracking data were gathered from 29 healthy volunteers during examination with three versions of the computerised version of the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). Understanding cognitive workload is of great importance in analysing human mental fatigue and the performance of intellectual tasks. It is also essential in the context of explanation of the brain cognitive process. Eight three-class classification machine learning models were constructed and analysed. Furthermore, the technique of interpretable machine learning model was applied to obtain the measures of feature importance and its contribution to the brain cognitive functions. The measures allowed improving the quality of classification, simultaneously lowering the number of applied features to six or eight, depending on the model. Moreover, the applied method of explainable machine learning provided valuable insights into understanding the process accompanying various levels of cognitive workload. The main classification performance metrics, such as F1, recall, precision, accuracy, and the area under the Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) were used in order to assess the quality of classification quantitatively. The best result obtained on the complete feature set was as high as 0.95 (F1); however, feature importance interpretation allowed increasing the result up to 0.97 with only seven of 20 features applied.

In this experiment, a visual perceptual decision-making task is performed by 14 participants, and their EEG data are recorded. The problem of measuring decision confidence levels is considered to be a pattern classification task, and two pattern classifiers are trained with differential entropy (DE), power spectral density (PSD), differential asymmetry (DASM), rational asymmetry (RASM), and asymmetry (ASM) features extracted from multichannel EEG data. We compare the performance of these features and find that the DE feature performs better than the others for measuring levels of decision confidence. The experimental results indicate that EEG signals offer good capability for measuring human decision confidence levels. The best performance of our proposed method in measuring five levels of decision confidence reaches an accuracy of 49.14% and F1-score of 45.07%, and for the extreme levels of decision confidence, the recognition accuracy reaches 91.28%, with an average F1-score of 88.92%. Topographic maps are also used to depict the neural patterns of EEG signals, suggesting that the posterior parietal cortex and occipital cortex might be sensitive brain areas for indicating decision confidence.

This paper proposes a novel control scheme wherein the ideal physical rehabilitation training-'what you think is what you move'-is performed by decoding the mind. First, for feature extraction and pattern classification, the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm were applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) signals collected by OpenBCI. Second, the result of motor imagery (MI) recognition was transferred from OpenViBE to Arduino UNO through the virtual reality peripheral network (VRPN). The spinal cord stimulator received corresponding commands to generate pulse signals of different polarities. Finally, an electrode pair was used to stimulate specific central pattern generator (CPG) site on the spinal cord of rats for rehabilitation training. Eight subjects participated in the classification experiment (highest accuracy rate, 91.38%). This system realised the gait-like movements corresponding to the subject's mind through functional electrical stimulation (FES). The subject with the best recognition result was selected and participated in the gait rehabilitation training experiment of rats with spinal cord injury (SCI). The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale score and grip strength were significantly better after three weeks in the SCI + electrical stimulation (ES) group than in the SCI group. The results proved the effectiveness of the novel system for motor function recovery. This study provides new ideas applicable to the existing methods of motor function rehabilitation and has immense scientific research value in rehabilitation medicine.

Estimation of mental workload (MWL) levels by electroencephalography (EEG)-based mental state monitoring systems has been widely explored. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited by ignored auditory probes, minimizes intrusiveness and has shown high performance for estimating MWL level when tested in laboratory situations. However, when facing real-world applications, the characteristics of ERP waveforms, like latency and amplitude, are often affected by noise, which leads to a decrease in classification performance. One approach to mitigating this is using spatial covariance, which is less sensitive to latency and amplitude distortion. In this study, we used ignored auditory probes in a single-stimulus paradigm and tested Riemannian processed covariance-based features for MWL level estimation in a realistic flight-control task. Approach. We recorded EEG data with an eight-channel system from participants while they performed a simulated drone-control task and manipulated MWL levels (high and low) by task difficulty. We compared support vector machine classification performance based on frequency band power features versus features generated via the Riemannian log map operator from spatial covariance matrices. We also compared accuracy of using data segmented as auditory ERPs versus non-ERPs, for which data windows did not overlap with the ERPs. Main results. Classification accuracy of both types of features showed no significant difference between ERPs and non-ERPs. When we ignore auditory stimuli to perform continuous decoding, covariance-based features in the gamma band had area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.883, which was significantly higher than band power features (AUC = 0.749). Significance. This study demonstrates that Riemannian-processed covariance features are viable for MWL classification under a realistic experimental scenario.

However, it is sensitive to outliers because of the employment of the L2-norm in its formulation. It is beneficial to perform robust modelling for CSP. In this paper, we propose a robust framework, called CSP-Lp/q, by formulating the variances of two EEG classes with Lp- and Lq-norms (0 < p and q< 2) separately. The method CSP-Lp/q with mixed Lp- and Lq-norms takes the class-wise difference into account in formulating the sample dispersion. We develop an iterative algorithm to optimize the objective function of CSP-Lp/q and show its monotonity theoretically. The superiority of the proposed CSP-Lp/q technique is experimentally demonstrated on three real EEG datasets of BCI competitions.

J	Mirzaei, G; Adeli, H				Mirzaei, Golrokh; Adeli, Hojjat			Machine learning techniques for diagnosis of alzheimer disease, mild cognitive disorder, and other types of dementia	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Alzheimer disease; Machine learning; Deep learning; Classification	CLASSIFICATION; IMPAIRMENT; MRI; EEG; ENSEMBLES; NETWORK; ATROPHY; MODEL; TAU	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common form of dementia which mostly affects elderly people. AD identification in early stages is a difficult task in medical practice and there is still no biomarker known to be precise in detection of AD in early stages. Also, AD is not a curable disease at this time and there is a high failure rate in clinical trials for AD drugs. Researchers are making efforts to find ways in early detection of AD to help in slowing down its progression. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on machine learning techniques used for detection and classification of AD with a focus on neuroimaging and primarily journal articles published since 2016. These techniques include Support Vector Machine, Random forest, Convolutional Neural Network, Kmeans, among others. This review suggests that there is no single best approach; however, deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks appear to be promising for diagnosis of AD, especially considering that they can leverage transfer learning which overcomes the limitations of availability of a large number of medical images. Research is still on-going to provide an accurate and efficient approach for diagnosis and prediction of AD. In recent years, a number of new and powerful supervised machine learning and classification algorithms have been developed such as the Enhanced Probabilistic Neural Network, Neural Dynamic Classification algorithm, Dynamic Ensemble Learning Algorithm, and Finite Element Machine for fast learning. Applications of these algorithms for diagnosis of AD have yet to be explored.

To evaluate the feasibility of an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based prediction model as a CPR feedback indicator of high- or low-CBF carotid blood flow (CBF), the frontal EEG and hemodynamic data including CBF were measured during animal experiments with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) swine model. The most significant 10 EEG parameters in the time, frequency and entropy domains were determined by neighborhood component analysis and Student's t-test for discriminating high- or low-CBF recovery with a division criterion of 30%. As a binary CBF classifier, the performances of logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor, random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms were compared with eight-fold cross-validation. The three-order polynomial kernel-based SVM model showed the best accuracy of 0.853. The sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and area under the curve of the SVM model were 0.807, 0.906, 0.853 and 0.909, respectively. An automated CBF classifier derived from non-invasive EEG is feasible as a potential indicator of the CBF recovery during CPR in a VF swine model.

These models have achieved significant results, but they are heavily designed with millions of parameters, which increases train and test time, making the model complex and less suitable for real-time analysis. This paper proposes a simple, lightweight CNN model to classify cognitive states from Electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. We develop a novel pipeline to learn distinct cognitive representation consisting of two stages. The first stage is to generate the 2D spectral images from neural time series signals in a particular frequency band. Images are generated to preserve the relationship between the neighboring electrodes and the spectral property of the cognitive events. The second is to develop a time-efficient, computationally less loaded, and high-performing model. We design a network containing 4 blocks and major components include standard and depth-wise convolution for increasing the performance and followed by separable convolution to decrease the number of parameters which maintains the tradeoff between time and performance. We experiment on open access EEG meditation dataset comprising expert, nonexpert meditative, and control states. We compare performance with six commonly used machine learning classifiers and four state of the art deep learning models. We attain comparable performance utilizing less than 4% of the parameters of other models. This model can be employed in a real-time computation environment such as neurofeedback.

In particular, researchers are investigating the use of EEG as a low-cost, non-invasive method. However, the poor homogeneity of the EEG activity across participants hinders the implementation of such a system by a time-consuming calibration stage. In this study, we introduce a new participant-based feature normalization method, named stratified normalization, for training deep neural networks in the task of cross-subject emotion classification from EEG signals. The new method is able to subtract inter-participant variability while maintaining the emotion information in the data. We carried out our analysis on the SEED dataset, which contains 62-channel EEG recordings collected from 15 participants watching film clips. Results demonstrate that networks trained with stratified normalization significantly outperformed standard training with batch normalization. In addition, the highest model performance was achieved when extracting EEG features with the multitaper method, reaching a classification accuracy of 91.6% for two emotion categories (positive and negative) and 79.6% for three (also neutral). This analysis provides us with great insight into the potential benefits that stratified normalization can have when developing any cross-subject model based on EEG.

In this study, we introduce a new thresholding method to monitor brain activities via a non-uniform multivariate (NUM) embedding of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Specifically, we present a NUM embedding optimization problem to identify the best embedding parameters. We originate one feature, named non-uniform multivariate multi-scale entropy (NUMME), which is extracted from the NUM embedded EEG data. Finally, the extracted feature, compared to an individualized threshold, is used for monitoring and detecting seizure onsets.

Boosting automated sleep staging performance in big datasets using population subgrouping	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep staging; subgrouping of population; intersubject variability; machine learning; clustering; covariance matrix; convolutional neural network	RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY; CLASSIFICATION; EEG; SIGNALS; COMPLEX	Current approaches to automated sleep staging from the electroencephalogram (EEG) rely on constructing a large labeled training and test corpora by aggregating data from different individuals. However, many of the subjects in the training set may exhibit changes in the EEG that are very different from the subjects in the test set. Training an algorithm on such data without accounting for this diversity can cause underperformance. Moreover, test data may have unexpected sensor misplacement or different instrument noise and spectral responses. This work proposes a novel method to learn relevant individuals based on their similarities effectively. The proposed method embeds all training patients into a shared and robust feature space. Individuals who share strong statistical relationships and are similar based on their EEG signals are clustered in this feature space before being passed to a deep learning framework for classification. Using 994 patient EEGs from the 2018 Physionet Challenge (approximate to 6,561 h of recording), we demonstrate that the clustering approach significantly boosts performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The proposed method improves, on average, a precision score from 0.72 to 0.81, a sensitivity score from 0.74 to 0.82, and a Cohen's Kappa coefficient from 0.64 to 0.75 under 10-fold cross-validation.

A Gradient-based Approach for Explaining Multimodal Deep Learning Classifiers	2021 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING (IEEE BIBE 2021)	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	21st IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (IEEE BIBE)	OCT 25-27, 2021	Kragujevac, SERBIA	IEEE, Minist Educ Sci & Technol Dev Republ Serbia, Res & Dev Ctr Bioengineering BioIRC, Univ Kragujevac		Explainability; Multimodal Fusion; Automated Sleep Staging; Electrophysiology		In recent years, more biomedical studies have begun to use multimodal data to improve model performance. Many studies have used ablation for explainability, which requires the modification of input data. This can create out-of-distribution samples and lead to incorrect explanations. To avoid this problem, we propose using a gradient-based feature attribution approach, called layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), to explain the importance of modalities both locally and globally for the first time. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach with sleep stage classification as our use-case and train a 1-D convolutional neural network with electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram (EMG) data. We also analyze the relationship of our local explainability results with clinical and demographic variables to determine whether they affect our classifier. Across all samples, EEG is the most important modality, followed by EOG and EMG. For individual sleep stages, EEG and EOG have higher relevance for awake and non-rapid eye movement 1 (NREM1). EOG is most important for REM, and EEG is most relevant for NREM2-NREM3. Also, LRP gives consistent levels of importance to each modality for the correctly classified samples across folds but inconsistent levels of importance for incorrectly classified samples. Our statistical analyses suggest that medication has a significant effect upon patterns learned for EEG and EOG NREM2 and that subject sex and age significantly affects the EEG and EOG patterns learned, respectively. Our results demonstrate the viability of gradient-based approaches for explaining multimodal electrophysiology classifiers and suggest their generalizability for other multimodal classification domains.

This paper uses a dataset for imagined speech to classify vowels based on the neurological areas of the brain. The normalized cross-correlation matrices between two electrodes are used as features. We demonstrate that by using the EEG from the frontal region of the brain, we obtain higher than 85 percent accuracy for correct vowel decoding by using two types of neural networks: convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). This accuracy is higher than previous studies that have classified the dataset using the entire brain region. This work shows great promise for task decoding where the physiological regions of the brain associated with specific tasks are exploited. The proposed approach has the potential to be deployed in future BCI applications.

A method for diagnosis support of mild cognitive impairment through EEG rhythms source location during working memory tasks	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Mild Cognitive Impairment; Alzheimer's disease; Working memory; Source localization (LORETA); Machine learning; Support vector machine (SVM)	BRAIN ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; EARLY ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GRAY-MATTER LOSS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS; DEMENTIA; FMRI; METAANALYSIS; BIOMARKERS	Objective: We investigated group differences in current source density (CSD) patterns from EEG signals before and after a working memory (WM) task performed by mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects and healthy elderly (HE). Methods: EEG was recorded during N-back WM tasks in 41 age-, sex- and education-matched participants divided into MCI (N = 19) and HE (N = 22) groups. EEG epochs were divided into pre- and post-stimulus periods, named herein as working memory epochs (WME) and event-related epochs (ERE), respectively. Frequency-domain CSD was extracted for both WME and ERE on delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands using LORETA. Group comparisons were performed under Statistical non-Parametric Mapping. Moreover, after feature selection, we performed cross-validation with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Results: MCI displayed increased spectral CSD on delta and theta (low-frequency) and decreased spectral CSD on (high-frequency) alpha and beta bands when compared to HE. Surprisingly, MCI patients presented an increase in gamma at precuneus and a decrease at occipital cortex. Group prediction through SVM achieved 96% accuracy, 98% specificity and 93% sensitivity when WME and ERE spectral CSD features were combined. Conclusions: Our findings confirmed the overall EEG slowing observed in classical MCI resting-state EEG literature as well as alpha desynchronization changes observed in task-related EEG literature. Furthermore, they also revealed MCI abnormalities in the gamma band. Significance: Our frequency-domain analysis of CSD patterns in task-related EEG, focusing both on pre- and poststimulus periods, may be a clinically relevant tool to support MCI diagnosis.

J	Sharma, M; Dhiman, HS; Acharya, UR				Sharma, Manish; Dhiman, Harsh S.; Acharya, U. Rajendra			Automatic identification of insomnia using optimal antisymmetric biorthogonal wavelet filter bank with ECG signals	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Insomnia; ECG; Wavelets; Filter Banks; Classification; machine learning	HEART-RATE; SLEEP; DIAGNOSIS; POWER	Sleep is a fundamental human physiological activity required for adequate working of the human body. Sleep disorders such as sleep movement disorders, nocturnal front lobe epilepsy, insomnia, and narcolepsy are caused due to low sleep quality. Insomnia is one such sleep disorder where a person has difficulty in getting quality sleep. There is no definitive test to identify insomnia; hence it is essential to develop an automated system to identify it accurately. A few automated methods have been proposed to identify insomnia using either poly-somnogram (PSG) or electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to automatically detect insomnia using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals without combining them with any other physiological signals. In the proposed study, an optimal antisymmetric biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (ABWFB) has been used, which is designed to minimize the joint duration-bandwidth localization (JDBL) of the underlying filters. The L-1-norm feature is computed from the various wavelet sub-bands coefficients of ECG signals. The L-1 norm features are fed to various supervised machine learning classifiers for the automated detection of insomnia. In this work, ECG recordings of seven insomnia patients and six normal subjects are used from the publicly available cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) sleep database. We created ten different subsets of ECG signals based on annotations of sleep-stages, namely wake (W), S1, S2, S3, S4, rapid eye moment (REM), light sleep stage (LSS), slow-wave sleep (SWS), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and W + S1+S2+S3+S4+REM for the automated identification of insomnia. Our proposed ECG-based system obtained the highest classification accuracy of 97.87%, F1-score of 97.39%, and Cohen's kappa value of 0.9559 for K-nearest neighbour (KNN) with the ten-fold cross-validation strategy using ECG signals corresponding to the REM sleep stage. The support vector machine (SVM) yielded the highest value of 0.99 for area under the curve with the ten fold cross-validation corresponding to REM sleep stage.

Seizure Diaries and Forecasting With Wearables: Epilepsy Monitoring Outside the Clinic	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						wearable devices; seizure detection; seizure forecasting; multidian cycles; machine learning; epilepsy	BRAIN-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AUTOMATED SEIZURE; DETECTION SYSTEMS; SELF-PREDICTION; RISK-FACTOR; LONG-TERM; PATIENT; ADULTS; EEG	It is a major challenge in clinical epilepsy to diagnose and treat a disease characterized by infrequent seizures based on patient or caregiver reports and limited duration clinical testing. The poor reliability of self-reported seizure diaries for many people with epilepsy is well-established, but these records remain necessary in clinical care and therapeutic studies. A number of wearable devices have emerged, which may be capable of detecting seizures, recording seizure data, and alerting caregivers. Developments in non-invasive wearable sensors to measure accelerometry, photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG), and other signals outside of the traditional clinical environment may be able to identify seizure-related changes. Non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and minimally invasive subscalp EEG may allow direct measurement of seizure activity. However, significant network and computational infrastructure is needed for continuous, secure transmission of data. The large volume of data acquired by these devices necessitates computer-assisted review and detection to reduce the burden on human reviewers. Furthermore, user acceptability of such devices must be a paramount consideration to ensure adherence with long-term device use. Such devices can identify tonic-clonic seizures, but identification of other seizure semiologies with non-EEG wearables is an ongoing challenge. Identification of electrographic seizures with subscalp EEG systems has recently been demonstrated over long (> 6 month) durations, and this shows promise for accurate, objective seizure records. While the ability to detect and forecast seizures from ambulatory intracranial EEG is established, invasive devices may not be acceptable for many individuals with epilepsy. Recent studies show promising results for probabilistic forecasts of seizure risk from long-term wearable devices and electronic diaries of self-reported seizures. There may also be predictive value in individuals' symptoms, mood, and cognitive performance. However, seizure forecasting requires perpetual use of a device for monitoring, increasing the importance of the system's acceptability to users. Furthermore, long-term studies with concurrent EEG confirmation are lacking currently. This review describes the current evidence and challenges in the use of minimally and non-invasive devices for long-term epilepsy monitoring, the essential components in remote monitoring systems, and explores the feasibility to detect and forecast impending seizures via long-term use of these systems.

In the field of motor imagery (MI) classification, appropriate filtering is vital for feature extracting of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and consequently influences the accuracy of MI classification. In this case, a novel two-stage refine filtering method was proposed, inspired by Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which uses the gradients of any target concept flowing into the final convolutional layer to highlight the important part of training data for predicting the concept. In the first stage, MI classification was carried out and then the frequency band to be filtered was calculated according to the Grad-CAM of the MI classification results. In the second stage, EEG was filtered and classified for a higher classification accuracy. To evaluate the filtering effect, this method was applied to the multi-branch neural network proposed in our previous work. Experiment results revealed that the proposed method reached state-of-the-art classification kappa value levels and acquired at least 3% higher kappa values than other methods This study also proposed some promising application scenarios with this filtering method.</p>	[Yan, Yuxin; Huang, Lixin] Soochow Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Haifeng; Kuang, Shaolong] Soochow Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Xiao] Soochow Univ, Appl Technol Coll, Suzhou, Peoples R China		Huang, LX (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Suzhou, Peoples R China.; Cheng, X (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Appl Technol Coll, Suzhou, Peoples R China.	szhuanglx@yeah.net; cheng18251162064@163.com			National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1713218, U1613224]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers U1713218 and U1613224).		30	0	0	4	11	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		1662-453X		FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ	Front.

J	Zhang, WL; Liang, ZY; Liu, ZR				Zhang, Wulin; Liang, Zeyu; Liu, Zirui			Combination of Variational Mode Decomposition for Feature Extraction and Deep Belief Network for Feature Classification in Motor Imagery Electroencephalogram Recognition	SENSORS AND MATERIALS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; motor imagery; variational mode decomposition; deep brief network; high-dimensional feature classification; high-dimensional feature extraction	EEG CLASSIFICATION	Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology based on motor imagery (MI) can establish the connection between the brain and the outside world; this has gradually become an important application of human-machine hybrid intelligence enhancement, especially for medical rehabilitation treatment. Because of the nonlinear, nonstationary, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, it is a great challenge to accurately classify MI-EEG signals. Toward this end, in this study, both variational mode decomposition (VMD) and a deep belief network (DBN) were applied to MI classification based on the dataset of a previous BCI competition. Firstly, the EEG signal was decomposed by VMD to obtain the narrow-band component. Then the marginal spectrum, the instantaneous energy spectrum under the characteristic frequency band, and time-frequency joint features were extracted by Hilbert transform to achieve feature fusion. Finally, the DBN was used to reduce the dimensions of high- dimensional features and recognize MI patterns. The experimental results show that the joint VMD feature extraction and DBN feature classification method avoids information omission caused by the manual optimization of the period and the frequency band of artificial determination imagery. On the other hand, the method of using VMD and DBN to automatically extract the characteristics of the optimal period and optimal frequency band can effectively improve the recognition rate of MI.

Being able to recognize the emotions of users of interactive systems is a distinguishing feature of intelligent interactive systems. The intelligent HCIS can analyze the emotional changes of patients with depression, complete the interaction with the patients in a more appropriate manner, and the recognition results can assist family members or medical personnel to make response measures based on the patient's emotional changes. Based on this background, this paper proposes a sentiment recognition method based on transfer support vector machines (TSVM) and EEG signals. The ER (ER) results based on this method are applied to HCIS. Such a HCIS is mainly used for the interaction of patients with depression. When a new field related to a certain field appears, if the new field data is relabeled, the sample is expensive, and it is very wasteful to discard all the old field data. The main innovation of this research is that the introduced classification model is TSVM. TSVM is a transfer learning strategy based on SVM. Transfer learning aims to solve related but different target domain problems by using a large amount of labeled source domain data. Therefore, the transfer support vector machine based on the transfer mechanism can use the small labeled data of the target domain and a large amount of old data in the related domain to build a high-quality classification model for the target domain, which can effectively improve the accuracy of classification. Comparing the classification results with other classification models, it can be concluded that TSVM can effectively improve the accuracy of ER in patients with depression. The HCIS based on the classification model has higher accuracy and better stability.

The motor commands about the movements of fine parts can increase the degrees of freedom under control and be applied to external equipment without stimulus. In the decoding process, the classifier is one of the key factors, and the graph information of the EEG was ignored by most researchers. In this paper, a graph convolutional network (GCN) based on functional connectivity was proposed to decode the motor intention of four fine parts movements (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand). First, event-related desynchronization was analyzed to reveal the differences between the four classes. Second, functional connectivity was constructed by using synchronization likelihood (SL), phase-locking value (PLV), H index (H), mutual information (MI), and weighted phase-lag index (WPLI) to acquire the electrode pairs with a difference. Subsequently, a GCN and convolutional neural networks (CNN) were performed based on functional topological structures and time points, respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a decoding accuracy of up to 92.81% in the four-class task. Besides, the combination of GCN and functional connectivity can promote the development of BCI.

Accurate classification of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on ERP data could help improve our understanding of these alterations and propel novel diagnostic or screening measures. However, it has been particularly challenging due to the lack of generalization for noisy raw data with small sample sizes. We aim to improve classification performance for MDD using noisy ERP datasets using machine learning (ML) techniques. Results: We have developed two optimizations in our ML-based analysis of ERP datasets: effective feature extraction in the preprocessing of high-dimensional noisy data and enhanced classification through ensemble ML models. Together with a carefully designed validation strategy, our techniques provide a highly accurate method for MDD classification even for ERP data that are limited in sample size, inherently noisy and high-dimensional in nature. Our experimental results demonstrate that our ML optimizations achieve great accuracy and nearly perfect sensitivity simultaneously, particularly in classifying data samples unseen during the training process, compared to prior studies that perform regression-based classifications.

This study comprised 159 subjects obtained from the ISRUC (Institute of System and Robotics-University of Coimbra), Sleep-EDF (European Data Format), and CAP (Cyclic Alternating Pattern) Sleep database, which consists of normal and sleep apnea subjects. The wavelet packet decomposition method was incorporated to categorize the EEG signals into five frequency bands, namely, alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and theta. Entropy and energy (non-linear) for all bands was calculated and as a result, 10 features were obtained for each EEG signal. The ratio of EEG bands included four parameters, including heart rate, brain perfusion, neural activity, and synchronization. In this study, a support vector machine with kernels and random forest classifiers was used for classification. The performance measures demonstrated that the improved results were obtained from the support vector machine classifier with a kernel polynomial order 2. The accuracy (90%), sensitivity (100%), and specificity (83%) with 14 features were estimated using the data obtained from ISRUC database. The proposed study is feasible and seems to be accurate in classifying the subjects with sleep apnea based on the extracted features from EEG signals using a support vector machine classifier.

However, the selection of a feature set with an appropriate low computational cost without compromising classification performance is still a challenge. This study attempts to represent sleep EEG patterns using a minimum number of features, without significant performance loss. Methods: : Three feature selection algorithms were applied to a high dimensional feature space com-prising 84 features. These methods were based on a bootstrapping approach guided by Gini ranking and mutual information between the features. The algorithms were tested on three scalp electroencephalog-raphy (EEG) and one ear-EEG datasets. The relationship between the information carried by different features was investigated using mutual information and illustrated by a graphical clustering tool. Results: : The minimum number of features that can represent the whole feature set without perfor-mance loss was found to range between 5 and 11 for different datasets. In ear-EEG, 7 features based on Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) resulted in similar performance as the whole set whereas in two scalp EEG datasets, the difference between minimal CWT set and the whole set was statistically signif-icant (0.008 and 0.017 difference in average kappa). Features were divided into groups according to the type of information they carry. The group containing relative power features was identified as the most informative feature group in sleep stage classification, whereas the group containing non-linear features was found to be the least informative. Conclusions: : This study showed that EEG sleep staging can be performed based on a low dimensional feature space without significant decrease in sleep staging performance. This is especially important in the case of wearable devices like ear-EEG where low computational complexity is needed. The division of the feature space into groups of features, and the analysis of the distribution of feature groups for different f eature set sizes, is helpful in the selection of an appropriate feature set.

Machine learning based intelligent automated neonatal epileptic seizure detection	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Neonatal Epileptic Seizure; neurological disorder; neonates; EEG; ANN; 1D-CNN; deep learning; Helsinki dataset; computer vision		Epilepsy is found to be the fourth most common chronic neurological disorder that tends to abnormal and unpredictable brain activity and seizure states. According to statistics, 70% of the epilepsy patients can be cured if identified and treated with anti-epileptic drugs or shock stimulations. Only about 7% to 8% need to be operated. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cheap and effective way to record the prolonged activities of the brain through electrical impulses between neural cells. Seizure is difficult to detect in neonates as the signal involves a lot of disturbances and the existing high accuracy system for adults can't be used for neonates. In an attempt to build an impregnable system to detect seizure in early stages, EEG signals of neonates procured from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Helsinki University Hospital. These signals were processed and fed into three different robust algorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN). The experimental results were compared and the proposed CNN model with 95.99% accuracy outperforms all the state-of-art models for automated Epileptic Seizure prediction in Neonates. Deep CNN has been a powerful tool in extracting robust features from EEG signals. This generalized system can be used by medical experts for detecting Seizure in neonates with better accuracy and reliability.

In this work, an HMI based on electrooculography (EOG) is presented, the instrumentation is placed on portable glasses that have the task of acquiring both horizontal and vertical EOG signals. The registration of each eye movement is identified by a class and categorized using the one hot encoding technique to test precision and sensitivity of different machine learning classification algorithms capable of identifying new data from the eye registration; the algorithm allows to discriminate blinks in order not to disturb the acquisition of the eyeball position commands. The implementation of the classifier consists of the control of a three-wheeled omnidirectional robot to validate the response of the interface. This work proposes the classification of signals in real time and the customization of the interface, minimizing the user's learning curve. Preliminary results showed that it is possible to generate trajectories to control an omnidirectional robot to implement in the future assistance system to control position through gaze orientation.

The sessions were performed by the same subject in eight consecutive years. Modeling the EEG signal as an autoregressive process (by means of Itakura distance and symmetric Itakura distance), amplitude modulation (using the amplitude modulation energy index) and phase synchronization (measuring phase locking value, phase lag index and weighted phase lag index) are the methods used for getting the appropriate information. The extracted features are classified using linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, Mahalanobis distance, support vector machine and k nearest neighbor classifiers. The highest classifications rates are achieved when Itakura distance withMahalanobis distance based classifier are applied. The outcomes of this research may improve the design of assistive devices for restoration of movement and communication strength for physically disabled patients in order to rehabilitate their lost motor abilities and to improve the quality of their daily life.

Implementation of Neural Networks to Frontal Electroencephalography for the Identification of the Transition Responsiveness/Unresponsiveness During Induction of General Anesthesia	IRBM			English	Article						Anesthesia; Propofol; Remifentanil; Loss of responsiveness; Electroencephalogram; Deep neural network; Convolution neural networks	PROPOFOL; DEPTH	Objective: General anesthesia is a reversible drug-induced state of altered arousal characterized by loss of responsiveness (LOR) due to brainstem inactivation. Precise identification of the LOR during the induction of general anesthesia is extremely important to provide personalized information on anesthetic requirements and could help maintain an adequate level of anesthesia throughout surgery, ensuring safe and effective care and balancing the avoidance of intraoperative awareness and overdose. So, main objective of this paper was to investigate whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) applied to bilateral frontal electroencephalography (EEG) dataset recorded from patients during opioid-propofol anesthetic procedures identified the exact moment of LOR. Material and methods: A clinical protocol was designed to allow for the characterization of different clinical endpoints throughout the transition to unresponsiveness. Fifty (50) patients were enrolled in the study and data from all was included in the final dataset analysis. While under a constant estimated effect-site concentration of 2.5 ng/mL of remifentanil, an 1% propofol infusion was started at 3.3 mL//h until LOR. The level of responsiveness was assessed by an anesthesiologist every six seconds using a modified version of the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (aRASS). The frontal EEG was acquired using a bilateral bispectral (BIS VISTA (TM) v2.0, Medtronic, Ireland) sensor. EEG data was then split into 5-second epochs, and for each epoch, the anesthesiologist's classification was used to label it as responsiveness (no-LOR) or unresponsiveness (LOR). All 5-second epochs were then used as inputs for the CNN model to classify the untrained segment as no-LOR or LOR. Results: The CNN model was able to identify the transition from no-LOR to LOR successfully, achieving 97.90 +/- 0.07% accuracy on the cross-validation set. Conclusion: The obtained results showed that the proposed CNN model was quite efficient in the responsiveness/unresponsiveness classification. We consider our approach constitutes an additional technique to the current methods used in the daily clinical setting where LOR is identified by the loss of response to verbal commands or mechanical stimulus. We therefore hypothesized that automated EEG analysis could be a useful tool to detect the moment of LOR, especially using machine learning approaches. (C) 2021 AGBM.

J	Hong, S; Baek, HJ				Hong, Seunghyeok; Baek, Hyun Jae			Drowsiness Detection Based on Intelligent Systems with Nonlinear Features for Optimal Placement of Encephalogram Electrodes on the Cerebral Area	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; biosignal; measurement; sleepiness; fatigue; DDS; driving; machine learning; random forest; SVM		Drowsiness while driving can lead to accidents that are related to the loss of perception during emergencies that harm the health. Among physiological signals, brain waves have been used as informative signals for the analyses of behavioral observations, steering information, and other biosignals during drowsiness. We inspected the machine learning methods for drowsiness detection based on brain signals with varying quantities of information. The results demonstrated that machine learning could be utilized to compensate for a lack of information and to account for individual differences. Cerebral area selection approaches to decide optimal measurement locations could be utilized to minimize the discomfort of participants. Although other statistics could provide additional information in further study, the optimized machine learning method could prevent the dangers of drowsiness while driving by considering a transitional state with nonlinear features. Because brain signals can be altered not only by mental fatigue but also by health status, the optimization analysis of the system hardware and software will be able to increase the power-efficiency and accessibility in acquiring brain waves for health enhancements in daily life.

Certain cases will lead to death. The detection and diagnosis is therefore an important task. It can be performed either by direct patient activity during seizure or by electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis by neurologists. EEG signal processing and detection of seizures using machine learning techniques make this task easier than manual detection. To overcome this problem related to a neurological disorder, we have proposed the ensemble learning technique for improved detection of epilepsy seizures from EEG signals. In the first stage, EEG signal decomposition is done by utilizing empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for smooth analysis in terms of sub-bands. Further, features are extracted from each sub. Time and frequency domain features are the two categories used to extract the statistical features. These features are used in a stacked ensemble of deep neural network (DNN) model along with multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for the detection and classification of ictal, inter-ictal, and pre-ictal (normal) signals. The proposed method is verified using two publicly available datasets provided by the University of Bonn (UoB dataset) and Neurology and Sleep Center -New Delhi (NSC-ND dataset). The proposed algorithm resulted in 98.93 % and 98 % accuracy for the UoB and NSC-ND datasets, respectively.

JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Continuous EEG; Encephalopathy; Antibiotics	NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; PERIODIC DISCHARGES	Generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphology were previously referred to as triphasic waves but have now been subsumed into the ACNS classification as generalized periodic discharges. Although triphasic waves and generalized spike-wave complexes may resemble each other and hence may be incorrectly identified in comatose critically ill patients, many authors believe that there are different entities, with definable morphologic and clinical differences attributable to each waveform. The occurrence of both patterns in the same patient is extremely rare with only a single prior case report. Here the authors report a patient with typical triphasic waves and generalized spike-wave complexes and highlight the morphologic and EEG differences between the two patterns. The occurrence of both waveforms in the same EEG recording supports the notion of different cerebral generators and pathways, further differentiating rather than merging these morphologies.

This work presents a deep transfer learning approach to overcome these issues and enable transferring knowledge from a large dataset to a small cohort for automatic sleep staging. Methods: We start from a generic end-to-end deep learning framework for sequence-to-sequence sleep staging and derive two networks as the means for transfer learning. The networks are first trained in the source domain (i.e. the large database). The pretrained networks are then finetuned in the target domain (i.e. the small cohort) to complete knowledge transfer. We employ the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) database consisting of 200 subjects as the source domain and study deep transfer learning on three different target domains: the Sleep Cassette subset and the Sleep Telemetry subset of the Sleep-EDF Expanded database, and the Surrey-cEEGrid database. The target domains are purposely adopted to cover different degrees of data mismatch to the source domains. Results: Our experimental results show significant performance improvement on automatic sleep staging on the target domains achieved with the proposed deep transfer learning approach. Conclusions: These results suggest the efficacy of the proposed approach in addressing the above-mentioned data-variability and data-inefficiency issues. Significance: As a consequence, it would enable one to improve the quality of automatic sleep staging models when the amount of data is relatively small.

J	Li, BW; Lin, YF; Gao, XR; Liu, ZW				Li, Bowen; Lin, Yanfei; Gao, Xiaorong; Liu, Zhiwen			Enhancing the EEG classification in RSVP task by combining interval model of ERPs with spatial and temporal regions of interest	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI; RSVP; interval model of ERPs; spatial projection; temporal auto-weighting		Objective. Brain-computer interface (BCI) systemsdirectly translate human intentions to instructions for machines by decoding the neural signals. The rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task is a typical paradigm of BCIs, in which subjects can detect the targets in the high-speed serial images. There are still two main challenges in electroencephalography (EEG) classification for RSVP tasks: inter-trial variability of event-related potentials (ERPs) and limited trial number of EEG training data. Approach. This study proposed an algorithm of discriminant analysis and classification for interval ERPs (DACIE) in RSVP tasks. Firstly, an interval model of ERPs was exploited to solve the inter-trial variability problem. Secondly, a spatial structured sparsity regularization was utilized to reinforce the important channels, which provided a spatial region of interest (sROI). Meanwhile, a temporal auto-weighting technique was conducted to emphasize the important discriminant components, which obtained a temporal regions of interest (tROIs). Thirdly, classification features were obtained by the discriminant eigenvalue analysis to avoid the ill-conditioned estimation of covariance matrix caused by fewer training trials. Main results. EEG datasets of 12 subjects in RSVP tasks were analyzed to evaluate the classification performance of proposed algorithm. The average accuracy rate, true positive rate, false positive rate and AUC value are 96.9%, 81.6%, 2.8% and 0.938, respectively. Compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm can provide significantly better classification performance. Significance. The interval model of ERPs was exploited in a spatial linear discriminant framework to overcome the inter-trial variability. The sROIs and tROIs were explored to reinforce the pivotal channels and temporal components. And the proposed algorithm can provide good performance with fewer training trials.

New method: We establish stability properties of the TDA descriptor persistence landscape (PL) in event related potential (ERP) across multi-trial EEG signals, state algorithms for computing PL, and propose an exact inference framework on persistence and PLs. Results: We apply the topological signal processing and inference framework to compare ERPs between individuals with post-stroke aphasia and healthy controls under a speech altered auditory feedback (AAF) paradigm. Results show significant PL difference in the ERP response of aphasic individuals and healthy controls over the parietal-occipital and occipital regions with respect to speech onset, and no significant PL difference in any regions with respect to the two pitch-shift stimuli. Comparison with existing methods: In comparison, spatial patterns of difference between aphasic individuals and healthy controls by persistence, local variance, and spectral powers are much more diffuse than the PL patterns. In simulation results, the exact test on persistence and PLs has more robust performance than the baseline tests on local variance and spectral powers. Conclusions: Persistence features provide a more robust EEG marker than local variance, and spectral powers. It could be a potentially powerful tool for comparing electrophysiological correlates in neurological disorders.

This paper presents a low-complexity three-class classification VLSI system for epilepsy and seizure detection. The designed system consists of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based feature extraction module, a sparse extreme learning machine (SELM) training module, and a multiclass classifier module. A lifting structure of Daubechies order 4 wavelet is introduced in three-level DWT to save circuit area and speed up the computational time. The SELM which is a novel machine learning algorithm with low hardware complexity and high-performance is used for on-chip training. One-against-one multiclass non-linear SELM is designed for the first time due to its high classification accuracy. The designed system is implemented on an FPGA platform and evaluated using the publicly available epilepsy dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed system achieves high accuracy with low-dimensional feature vectors.

J	Ghanbar, KD; Rezaii, TY; Farzamnia, A; Saad, I				Darvish Ghanbar, Khatereh; Yousefi Rezaii, Tohid; Farzamnia, Ali; Saad, Ismail			Correlation-based common spatial pattern (CCSP): A novel extension of CSP for classification of motor imagery signal	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; COMPONENTS; FEATURES	Common spatial pattern (CSP) is shown to be an effective pre-processing algorithm in order to discriminate different classes of motor-based EEG signals by obtaining suitable spatial filters. The performance of these filters can be improved by regularized CSP, in which available prior information is added in terms of regularization terms into the objective function of conventional CSP. Variety of prior information can be used in this way. In this paper, we used time correlation between different classes of EEG signal as the prior information, which is clarified similarity between different classes of signal for regularizing CSP. Furthermore, the proposed objective function can be easily extended to more than two-class problems. We used three different standard datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Correlation-based CSP (CCSP) outperformed original CSP as well as the existing regularized CSP, Principle Component Cnalysis (PCA) and Fisher Discriminate Analysis (FDA) in both two-class and multi-class scenarios. The simulation results showed that the proposed method outperformed conventional CSP by 6.9% in 2-class and 2.23% in multi-class problem in term of mean classification accuracy.

We further investigated the feasibility of using microstate features for differentiating different consciousness levels. Methods: 60-channel EEG was recorded from 31 male subjects in resting, light, and deep anesthesia states. Microstate analysis was performed on each consciousness levels separately. We first identified the optimal number of microstate templates for each consciousness levels and aligned them based on spatial similarity. Then, we extracted features including duration, coverage, and occurrence. Machine learning models including SVM, LDA and Random Forest were employed to classify different consciousness levels using microstate features. Finally, the cortical source of each microstates was analyzed using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography. Results: We found that the optimal number of microstates differed in different consciousness levels. 7 common and 2 anesthesia-specific microstates were identified. M4, M5, M1 and M2 were similar to the canonical microstates A to D. Occurrence of M6 and duration of M1, M5 and M7 monotonically decreased with increasing level of consciousness suppression. All three features of the anesthesia-specific microstate M8 significantly decreased with increasing level of anesthesia. The classifiers using microstate features showed a mean accuracy of 85.6% to classify three consciousness levels. Conclusion: EEG microstate features significantly altered during propofol-induced unconsciousness, and can be used to distinguish between consciousness levels. Significance: Microstate analysis may be a useful tool in deciphering the neural mechanism of propofol-induced anesthesia and provide useful features for quantifying levels of consciousness.

Accordingly, we present an auxiliary classification task for sleep staging to enable NNs to exploit clinically significant EEG patterns in data. Specifically, representations constructed from a global max pooling operator, promoting the NNs to extract distinctive signal patterns for each sleep stage, are adopted herein. While previous studies required additional training processes or parameter tuning phases for correct formulation of the domain knowledge during training, our method operates in an end-to-end manner without further calibration. During the experiments, the proposed method improved the classification accuracies compared to the original model. Moreover, intermediate representations in the proposed method were highly interpretable, wherein medically-significant features were correctly addressed with the activation values. Overall, the proposed method successfully augmented model qualities in two important aspects for adoption of AI in medical tasks: good model performance and clinically sound interpretation of models.

Prior research has shown that monitoring of EEG signals during sleep can contribute to automatic detection of apnea events. However, a more comprehensive classification of specific apnea types and their severity is required for accurate clinical diagnosis and real-time detection of critical apnea episodes. In this study, we employed annotated EEG signals from 25 apnea patients and constructed two distinct classifiers using EEG frequency domain and non-linear features for binary classification of apnea severity and multiclass classification of apnea types. In both classification problems, three models i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes (NB) were evaluated and compared. Results showed that SVM model performed the best in both classification problems reaching accuracy higher than the baseline level. The SVM performance in the binary classification of apnea severity was acceptable (76% mean accuracy) however in the case of multiclass classification of apnea types, the SVM classifier did not reach acceptable performance for all apnea types (48% mean accuracy). Our findings illustrate that in addition to the detection of apnea episodes, EEG signals can be used in classification of apnea severity, which could lead to development of accurate diagnostic systems for automatic assessment and management of sleep disorders.

The new therapy is based on the combination of a transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) strategy, a brain-machine interface (BMI) based on electroencephalographic signals, and a pedaling system. The new therapy was applied during five consecutive days to six CVA patients with motor limitations in their right lower limb that are in the subacute phase. In this article, not only the clinical results are presented, but also the experiences and challenges of performing clinical trials with patients are described, which can be of great interest for future researchers that are planning to evaluate BMIs and tDCS systems with patients.

Currently, this bio-engineering-based technology is being employed by researchers in various fields to develop cutting-edge applications. The classification of real-time MI-EEG signals is the most challenging task in these applications. The prediction performance of the existing classification methods is still limited due to the high dimensionality and dynamic behaviors of the real-time EEG data. Proposed method: To enhance the classification performance of real-time BCI applications, this paper presents a new clustering-based ensemble technique called CluSem to mitigate this problem. We also develop a new brain game called CluGame using this method to evaluate the classification performance of real-time motor imagery movements. In this game, real-time EEG signal classification and prediction tabulation through animated balls are controlled via threads. By playing this game, users can control the movements of the balls via the brain signals of motor imagery movements without using any traditional input devices. Results: Our results demonstrate that CluSem is able to improve the classification accuracy between 5% and 15% compared to the existing methods on our collected as well as the publicly available EEG datasets. The source codes used to implement CluSem and CluGame are publicly available at https://github.com/MdOchiuddinMiah/ MI-BCI_ML.

The sleep-wake pattern, which functions as an essential indicator of neurophysiological organization in the neonatal period, has profound meaning in the prediction of cognitive diseases and brain maturity. In recent years, unobtrusive sleep monitoring and automatic sleep staging have been intensively studied for adults, but much less for neonates. This work aims to investigate a novel video-based unobtrusive method for neonatal sleep-wake classification by analyzing the behavioral changes in the neonatal facial region. A hybrid model is proposed to monitor the sleep-wake patterns of human neonates. The model combines two algorithms: deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and support vector machine (SVM), where DCNN works as a trainable feature extractor and SVM as a classifier. Data was collected from nineteen Chinese neonates at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. The classification results are compared with the gold standard of video-electroencephalography scored by pediatric neurologists. Validations indicate that the proposed hybrid DCNN-SVM model achieved reliable performances in classifying neonatal sleep and wake states in RGB video frames (with the face region detected), with an accuracy of 93.8 +/- 2.2% and an F1-score 0.93 +/- 0.3.

However, the superiority of one system to one other cannot be determined based on the mentioned metrics. This is because such a system can be successful using one metric, but not the other ones. Moreover, such metrics are insufficient when the number of samples in the classes is unequal (imbalanced data). In this case, naturally, by using these metrics, a sensible comparison cannot be made between two given systems. In the present study, the comprehensive, fair, and accurate Roza (Roza means rose in Persian. When different permutations of the metrics used are superimposed in a polygon format, it looks like a flower, so we named it Roza.) metric is introduced for evaluating classification systems. This metric, which facilitates the comparison of systems, expresses the summary of many metrics with a single value. To verify the stability and validity of the metric and to conduct a comprehensive, fair, and accurate comparison between the systems, the Roza metric of the systems tested under the same conditions are calculated and comparisons are made. For this, systems tested with three different strategies on three different datasets are considered. The results show that the performance of the system can be summarized by a single value and the Roza metric can be used in all systems that include classification processes, as a powerful metric.

We aimed to create a web platform using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) architecture to predict students' performance, analyze mental fatigue, and provide real-time quantitative biofeedback to identify the best learning modality. Thus, the main goal was to develop a system that allows students to learn and improve their projects. We integrated the analysis of real-time biometric signals, machine learning algorithms, and web services as we observed their behavior under different learning modalities, seeking to improve cognitive performance. For this, 23 volunteers filled out the ten-question Fatigue Assessment Scale questionnaire about mental fatigue, validated with the P300 waves acquired during auditory-oddball (AO) tests. Synchronized data acquisition was achieved using Enophones and an E4 wristband. To develop predictive models, we collected the biometric data and incorporated it into an ML algorithm to visualize students' performance in real time. The system can accommodate other wearable systems with new features in further experiments. Thus, we believe this current development has the potential to further revolutionize traditional teaching with this methodology and future enhancements.

This extracted information can be used to perform an action and the amount of the information plays a significant role in the determination of brain computer interface (BCI) performance. The use of improved experimental paradigms as well as measuring the brain responses using electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most common approach for the BCI studies. In this study, the classification of the ongoing brain activity occurring as response to the four shapes is managed and reported. We applied Fourier transform to obtain the frequency spectrum regarding the one second time series of each channel with a time overlap of 50% to the feature set of each stimulus type. Four machine learning classifiers are implemented, and in the concept of the classification, (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) band power values for one second period constituted the feature set, resulting in a total of 315 features. Among the four ML classifier Quadratic Discriminant 87.1% recorded the highest accuracy.

A reliable and effective approach for early detection of MCI has become a critical challenge. Although compared with other costly or risky lab tests, electroencephalogram (EEG) seems to be an ideal alternative measure for early detection of MCI, searching for valid EEG features for classification between healthy controls (HCs) and individuals with MCI remains to be largely unexplored. Here, we design a novel feature extraction framework and propose that the spectral-power-based task-induced intra-subject variability extracted by this framework can be an encouraging candidate EEG feature for the early detection of MCI. In this framework, we extracted the task-induced intra-subject spectral power variability of resting-state EEGs (as measured by a between-run similarity) before and after participants performing cognitively exhausted working memory tasks as the candidate feature. The results from 74 participants (23 individuals with AD, 24 individuals with MCI, 27 HC) showed that the between-run similarity over the frontal and central scalp regions in the HC group is higher than that in the AD or MCI group. Furthermore, using a feature selection scheme and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the between-run similarity showed encouraging leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV) classification performance for the classification between the MCI and HC (80.39%) groups and between the AD vs. HC groups (78%), and its classification performance is superior to other widely-used features such as spectral powers, coherence, and the complexity estimated by Katz's method extracted from single-run resting-state EEGs (a common approach in previous studies). The results based on LOPO-CV, therefore, suggest that the spectral-power-based task-induced intra-subject EEG variability extracted by the proposed feature extraction framework has the potential to serve as a neurophysiological feature for the early detection of MCI in individuals.

Using machine learning analyses, with rigorous between-subject cross-validation and non-parametric permutation testing, we show that memorized sound content is strongly represented in phase-synchronization patterns between subregions of auditory and front-oparietal cortices. These phase-synchronization patterns predict the memorized sound content steadily across the studied maintenance period. In addition to connectivity-based representations, there are indices of more local, "activity silent" representations in auditory cortices, where the decoding accuracy of WM content significantly increases after task-irrelevant "impulse stimuli." Our results demonstrate that synchronization patterns across auditory sensory and association areas orchestrate neuronal coding of auditory WM content. This connectivity-based coding scheme could also extend beyond the auditory domain.

To do this, two different approaches are considered: a hierarchical tree-based algorithm, XGBoost, and feedfoward neural networks, highlighting the pros and cons of both approaches in the different steps of the classification task. Moreover, the sensitivity of the classification capabilities of the tool as a function of the number of available electrodes is also studied, highlighting what can be achieved by applying the method using commercial, wearable EEG systems. The main novelty of this work consists in significantly enlarging the pool of stimuli that the expert system can recognize and comprising different, possibly mixed, sensorial domains. The obtained results open the way to the design of portable devices for augmented communication systems, which can be of particular interest for the development of advanced Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) for communication with different types of neurologically impaired patients.

Automated algorithms like machine learning models have shown promise in detecting spikes without requiring human supervision. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive, high-quality, and accessible data that can be used to train these algorithms. The goal of this work is to assess whether Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can create synthetic spikes that are both realistic and that can improve the performance of machine learning classification. Here we developed an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN) to generate synthetic spikes and trained it on expert-annotated real spike events from intracranial EEG recordings. We found that the AC-GAN was capable of successfully generating realistic synthetic spikes, demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative metrics. Furthermore, the synthetic spikes improved classification accuracy when augmented to the training data. Our findings exemplify the utility of GANs in assisting with epilepsy diagnosis through synthesis of realistic neurophysiological signal waveforms and through data augmentation in classification.

Given that the multi-channel diagnosis does not always lead to an anonymous agreement between diagnostic channels (assessors), the question was how to arbitrate between different assessors to determine a final diagnosis. A multi-channel classification system consisting of interconnected neural networks was tested and compared with the baseline single-channel approaches and a multi-channel method using arbitrary decision-making rules. The system has a distributed problem-solving structure. It included a set of parallel assessor networks performing independent diagnoses based on data collected from different sensors. These individual assessments were assembled and passed to the final decision-making network working as an arbitrator and determining the final diagnostic outcome. The proposed method was validated using publicly available EEG data from the Sleep Disorders Center of the Ospedale Maggiore of Parma, Italy (physionet.org). The presented automatic classification and decision-making approach led to a 98.26% average accuracy, outperforming the baseline single-channel classifiers by 20%-33% and the multi-channel systems with traditional arbitrary decision-making methods by 4%-6%.

Most current methods of classifying different patterns for motor imagery EEG signals require complex pre-processing and feature extraction steps, which consume time and lack adaptability, ignoring individual differences in EEG signals. It is essential to improve algorithm performance with the increased classes and diversity of subjects. Approach. This study introduces deep learning method for end-to-end learning to complete the classification of four-class MI tasks, aiming to improve the recognition rate and balance the classification accuracy among different subjects. A new one-dimensional input data representation method is proposed. This representation method can increase the number of samples and ignore the influence of channel correlation. In addition, a cascade network of convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit is designed to learn time-frequency information from EEG data without extracting features manually, this model can capture the hidden representations related to different MI mode of each people. Main results. Experiments on BCI Competition 2a dataset and actual collected dataset achieve high accuracy near 99.40% and 92.56%, and the standard deviation is 0.34 and 1.35 respectively. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the advanced methods and baseline models. Significance. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of multi-classification and overcomes the impact of individual differences on classification by training neural network subject-dependent, which promotes the development of actual brain-computer interface systems.

J	Gwon, D; Ahn, M				Gwon, Daeun; Ahn, Minkyu			Alpha and high gamma phase amplitude coupling during motor imagery and weighted cross-frequency coupling to extract discriminative cross-frequency patterns	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Motor imagery; Alpha; High gamma; Cross frequency coupling; Phase amplitude coupling	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATION; COMMUNICATION; INVOLVEMENT	Motor imagery modulates specific neural oscillations like actual movement does. Representatively, suppression of the alpha power (e.g., event-related desynchronization [ERD]) is the typical pattern of motor imagery in the motor cortex. However, in addition to this amplitude-based feature, the coupling across frequencies includes important information about the brain functions and the existence of such complex information has been reported in various invasive studies. Yet, the interaction across multiple frequencies during motor imagery processing is still unclear and has not been widely studied, particularly concerning the non-invasive signals. In this study, we provide empirical evidence of the comodulation between the phase of alpha rhythm and the amplitude of high gamma rhythm during the motor imagery process. We used electroencephalography (EEG) in our investigation during the imagination of left-or right-hand movement recorded from 52 healthy subjects, and quantified the ERD of alpha and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) which is a relative change of modulation index to the base line period (before the cue). As a result, we found that the coupling between the phase of alpha (8-12 Hz) and the amplitude of high gamma (70-120 Hz) and this PAC decreases during motor imagery and then rebounds to the baseline like alpha ERD ( r = 0.29 to 0.42). This correlation between PAC and ERD was particularly stronger in the ipsilateral area. In addition, trials that demonstrated higher alpha power during the ready period (before the cue) showed a larger ERD during motor imagery and similarly, trials with higher modulation index during the ready period yielded a greater decrease in PAC during imagery. In the classification analysis, we found that the effective phase frequency that showed better decoding accuracy in left and right-hand imagery, varied across subjects. Motivated by result, we proposed a weighted cross-frequency coupling (WCFC) method that extracts the maximal discriminative feature by combining band power and CFC. In the evaluation, WCFC with only two electrodes yielded a performance comparable to the conventional algorithm with 64 electrodes in classifying left and right-hand motor imagery. These results indicate that the phase-amplitude frequency plays an important role in motor imagery, and that optimizing this frequency ranges is crucial for extracting information features to decode the motor imagery types.

A wireless cap guarantees very high wearability with dry electrodes and a low number of channels. Experimental validation is performed on a dataset from 17 volunteers. Different feature extractions from spatial, temporal, and frequency domain and classification strategies were evaluated. The performances of five supervised classifiers in discriminating between attention on pure movement and with distractors were compared. A k-Nearest Neighbors classifier achieved an accuracy of 92.8 +/- 1.6%. In this last case, the feature extraction is based on a custom 12 pass-band Filter-Bank (FB) and the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm. In particular, the mean Recall of classification (percentage of true positive in distraction detection) is higher than 92% and allows the therapist or an automated system to know when to stimulate the patient's attention for enhancing the therapy effectiveness.

Here, we proposed an updated paradigm utilizing motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs (normal gait imagery and hemiplegic gait imagery after stroke) and decoded such imagery via an electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based brain network. Thirty subjects were recruited to collect EEGs during motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs. Time-domain analysis, power spectrum analysis, time-frequency analysis, brain network analysis, and statistical analysis were used to explore the neural mechanisms of motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs. Then, EEG-based brain network features were extracted, and a support vector machine was used for decoding. The results showed that the two employed motor coordination imageries mainly activated sensorimotor areas; the frequency band power was mainly concentrated within theta and alpha bands, and brain functional connections mainly occurred in the right forehead. The combination of the network attributes of the EEG-based brain network and the spatial features of the adjacency matrix had good separability for the two kinds of gait imagery (p < 0.05), and the average classification accuracy of the combination feature was 92.96% +/- 7.54%. Taken together, our findings suggest that brain network features can be used to identify normal gait imagery and hemiplegic gait imagery after stroke.

Steady-state visual evoked potential based BCI (SSVEP-BCI) has received increasing attention due to its high information transfer rate, which is accomplished by individual calibration for frequency recognition. Task-related component analysis (TRCA) is a recent and state-of-the-art method for individually calibrated SSVEP-BCIs. However, in TRCA, the spatial filter learned from each stimulus may be redundant and temporal information is not fully utilized. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method, i.e., task-discriminant component analysis (TDCA), to further improve the performance of individually calibrated SSVEP-BCI. The performance of TDCA was evaluated by two publicly available benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrated that TDCA outperformed ensemble TRCA and other competing methods by a significant margin. An offline and online experiment testing 12 subjects further validated the effectiveness of TDCA. The present study provides a new perspective for designing decoding methods in individually calibrated SSVEP-BCI and presents insight for its implementation in high-speed brain speller applications.

However, a majority of those studies used behavioral measures of working memory, and it is not clear whether the working memory representations per se are influenced by the categorical structure or whether the biases arise in decision or response processes during the report. Here, I applied a multivariate decoding technique to EEG data collected during working memory tasks to determine whether neural activity associated with the representations in working memory is categorically biased prior to the report. I found that the decoding of spatial working memory was biased away from the nearest cardinal location, consistent with the biases observed in the behavioral responses. In a follow-up experiment which was designed to prevent the use of a response preparation strategy, I found that the decoding still exhibited categorical biases. Together, these results provide neural evidence that working memory representations themselves are categorically biased, imposing important constraints on the models of working memory representations.

Generalizable Seizure Detection Model Using Generating Transferable Adversarial Features	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Training; Feature extraction; Electroencephalography; Brain modeling; Robustness; Electrodes; Deep learning; EEG; seizure detection; inter-subject variability; adversarial neural network; transferable features		Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting 65 million people around the world. It is associated with seizures - a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain that can lead to profound transient changes in behavior, movements, feelings, and levels of consciousness. Current approaches to developing a generalized automated seizure detection algorithm rely on constructing large, labeled training and test corpora of electroencephalograms (EEGs) from different individuals. However, due to the inherent inter-subject variability, heterogeneity of acquisition hardware, different montage choices, and various recording environments, EEG patterns may exhibit very different distributions over time and between individuals. Therefore, training an algorithm on such data without accounting for this diversity can affect the performance of any classifier or predictor. In addition, this process smooths out individual differences, producing a general, but a non-specific model. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that generates transferable features to interpolate between features from the training and test sets. This is achieved by adversarially training deep classifiers to make consistent classifications or predictions over the transferable features. Experiments on an EEG seizure databases demonstrate that the proposed method increases the accuracy over state-of-the-art from 86.83% to 91.71% and specificity from 87.38% to 94.73% while reducing the false positive rate/hour from 0.8/hour to 0.58/hour. Therefore, this work has the potential for significantly reducing workload in reviewing clinical EEGs for seizures, and for improved real-time closed-loop vagal stimulation.

A convolutional-recurrent neural network approach to resting-state EEG classification in Parkinson's disease	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; EEG classification; Convolutional-recurrent neural networks; Computer-aided diagnosis; Computer-aided disease monitoring	EARLY-STAGE; IMPAIRMENT	Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is expected to become more common, particularly with an aging population. Diagnosis and monitoring of the disease typically rely on the laborious examination of physical symptoms by medical experts, which is necessarily limited and may not detect the prodromal stages of the disease. New method: We propose a lightweight (similar to 20 K parameters) deep learning model to classify resting-state EEG recorded from people with PD and healthy controls (HC). The proposed CRNN model consists of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with gated recurrent units (GRUs). The 1D CNN layers are designed to extract spatiotemporal features across EEG channels, which are subsequently supplied to the GRUs to discover temporal features pertinent to the classification. Results: The CRNN model achieved 99.2% accuracy, 98.9% precision, and 99.4% recall in classifying PD from HC. Interrogating the model, we further demonstrate that the model is sensitive to dopaminergic medication effects and predominantly uses phase information in the EEG signals. Comparison with existing methods: The CRNN model achieves superior performance compared to baseline machine learning methods and other recently proposed deep learning model. Conclusion: The approach proposed in this study adequately extracts spatial and temporal features in multichannel EEG signals that enable accurate differentiation between PD and HC. The CRNN model has excellent potential for use as an oscillatory biomarker for assisting in the diagnosis and monitoring of people with PD. Future studies to further improve and validate the model's performance in clinical practice are warranted.

Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior and a widely used pattern in electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. EEG is known for its non-stationary, non-linear features and sensitivity to artifacts from various sources. This study aimed to design a powerful classifier with a strong generalization capability for MI based BCIs. Approach. In this study, we proposed a cluster decomposing based ensemble learning framework (CDECL) for EEG classification of MI based BCIs. The EEG data was decomposed into sub-data sets with different distributions by clustering decomposition. Then a set of heterogeneous classifiers was trained on each sub-data set for generating a diversified classifier search space. To obtain the optimal classifier combination, the ensemble learning was formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and a stochastic fractal based binary multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm was proposed for solving the ensemble learning problem. Main results. The proposed method was validated on two public EEG datasets (BCI Competition IV datasets IIb and BCI Competition IV dataset IIa) and compared with several other competing classification methods. Experimental results showed that the proposed CDECL based methods can effectively construct a diversity ensemble classifier and exhibits superior classification performance in comparison with several competing methods. Significance. The proposed method is promising for improving the performance of MI-based BCIs.

The phase-space representation (PSR) method is useful for analysing the non-linear characteristics of EEG signals. Hence non-linear features based on a phase-space representation of EEG signals are effective in epileptic-seizure classification. In the past, various machine learning methods are used for classifying seizure EEG signals. However, they might fail to classify accurately due to complex data, so with effective non-linear features, ensemble learning classifiers can be investigated to improve the accuracy of an automated epileptic-seizure detection system. In this paper, the EEG signals are first decomposed in sub-bands using empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based on the Fourier Bessel series expansion (FBSE) which is termed as FBSE-EWT. Then, these sub-bands are reconstructed into threedimensional (3D) PSR. Next, entropy-based features like line-length (LL), log-energy-entropy (LEEnt), and norm-entropy (NEnt) are computed from Euclidean distances of 3D PSR of sub-band signals. The extracted features are ranked based on p-values obtained from the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test for reducing the feature space. Experiments have been conducted using obtained ranked features on different ensemble learning classifiers, and the five best-performing classifiers are reported here, which are random forest (RF), extra tree (ET), extreme gradient boosting tree (xgBT), bagged-SVM (B-SVM), and bagged-k-nearest neighbours (B-k-NN), for classifying epileptic-seizure EEG signals. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a publically accessible Bonn university EEG database for classifying epileptic-seizure EEG signals on well-known classification problems such as C1 (seizure, normal), C2, and C3 (seizure, normal, and seizure-free). This dataset consists recording of 100 single-EEG signals from five seizure, seizure-free, and normal (healthy) subjects each. Model is trained and tested using 10-fold cross-validation to stave off from overfitting. The performance is also compared with other state-of-art methods. Obtained results confirm the superior performance of the proposed framework by achieving maximum classification accuracy of 100 %, 98.3 %, 97.8 % with ET, B-SVM, and ET classifiers from each studied classification problem, respectively. Hence, the proposed framework can assist medical professionals in analysing epileptic-seizure EEG signals more accurately.

This change and evaluation of anxiety state are accompanied by a comprehensive treatment procedure. It is well-known that the treatment of anxiety is chiefly based on psychotherapy and drug therapy, and there is no objective standard evaluation. In this paper, the proposed method focuses on examining neural changes to explore the effect of mindfulness regulation in accordance with neurofeedback in patients with anxiety. We designed a closed neurofeedback experiment that includes three stages to adjust the psychological state of the subjects. A total of 34 subjects, 17 with anxiety disorder and 17 healthy, participated in this experiment. Through the three stages of the experiment, electroencephalography (EEG) resting state signal and mindfulness-based EEG signal were recorded. Power spectral density was selected as the evaluation index through the regulation of neurofeedback mindfulness, and repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) method was used for statistical analysis. The findings of this study reveal that the proposed method has a positive effect on both types of subjects. After mindfulness adjustment, the power map exhibited an upward trend. The increase in the average power of gamma wave indicates the relief of anxiety. The enhancement of the wave power represents an improvement in the subjects' mindfulness ability. At the same time, the results of ANOVA showed that P < 0.05, i.e., the difference was significant. From the aspect of neurophysiological signals, we objectively evaluated the ability of our experiment to relieve anxiety. The neurofeedback mindfulness regulation can effect on the brain activity pattern of anxiety disorder patients.

In our study, three shapes of traffic symbols (circles, squares, and triangles) which are most commonly used in road driving were used to evaluate the elderly drivers' recognition. When traffic signs are randomly shown in HUD (head-up display), subjects compare them with the symbol displayed outside of the vehicle. In this test, we conducted a Go/Nogo test and determined the differences in ERP (event-related potential) data between correct and incorrect answers of EEG signals. As a result, the wrong answer rate for the elderly was 1.5 times higher than for the youths. All generation groups had a delay of 20-30 ms of P300 with incorrect answers. In order to achieve clearer differentiation, ERP data were modeled with unsupervised machine learning and supervised deep learning. The young group's correct/incorrect data were classified well using unsupervised machine learning with no pre-processing, but the elderly group's data were not. On the other hand, the elderly group's data were classified with a high accuracy of 75% using supervised deep learning with simple signal processing. Our results can be used as a basis for the implementation of a personalized safe driving system for the elderly.

J	Ozbeyaz, A				Ozbeyaz, Abdurrahman			EEG-Based classification of branded and unbranded stimuli associating with smartphone products: comparison of several machine learning algorithms	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Classification of branded stimuli; Channel selection; Feature extraction		Neurocomputing studies on consumer attitudes have recently made a significant contribution to branding psychology. This study investigates consumer decisions for a branded stimulus using advanced machine learning algorithms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded during experiments in which ten branded and ten unbranded smartphones were shown to the subjects as stimuli. Then, EEG signals were classified using a methodological approximation consisting of four stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, channel selection, and classification. This is the first time a four-stage methodology has been applied in a neuromarketing study. The analysis study employed autoregressive (AR), principal component analysis (PCA), and piecewise constant modeling (PCM) in the feature extraction stage; artificial bee colony (ABC) and independent component analysis (ICA) in the channel selection stage; and artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) in the classification stage. By comparing the successes of the methods in each stage, the methodological combination that gives the best classification performance was determined. According to the results, 72% accuracy was obtained in the average classification and an 85% accuracy on an individual basis. In the classification that achieved the best success, PCA in feature extraction, ABC in channel selection, and ANN in classification were used. In addition, the AF3-F7 (frontal brain regions) channels were observed to be the best-decomposed channel pair for different classes. The results also showed that stimulation within the brain for a branded product occurred at about 200 ms after the stimulus onset.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely used to diagnose possible epileptic seizures. Many researchers have been devoted to predicting the seizures and abnormal discharges of brain regions by analyzing the nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals. Predicting the future state of a nonlinear dynamic system such as EEG signals is a difficult task, especially when only short-term and high-dimensional EEG signal samples are available in the real system. Therefore, this paper proposes a method based on the Randomly Distributed Embedding (RDE) method. We first use the model sequence generated by the Rossler system to analyze the effectiveness of the RDE model for predicting nonlinear dynamic systems, and then apply the RDE model to the prediction of the EEG signals of normal people and epilepsy patients. Under the harsh premise of small amount of data with high dimensions, it overcomes the shortcomings of traditional machine learning prediction algorithms that require substantial training data volume. It converts the high-dimensional hindrance to prediction into a source of practical information, which can accurately predict the future state of EEG signals of normal people and epilepsy patients.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) workflows have permeated into nearly all aspects of daily life in the developed world but have not been implemented routinely in neurophysiological analyses. The power of these workflows includes the speed at which they can be deployed, their availability of open-source programming languages, and the objectivity permitted in their data analysis. We used classification-based algorithms, including random forest, gradient boosted machines, support vector machines, and neural networks, to test the hypothesis that the animal genotypes could be separated into their genotype based on interpretation of neurophysiological recordings. We then interrogate the models to identify what were the major features utilized by the algorithms to designate genotype classification. By using raw EEG and respiratory plethysmography data, we were able to predict which recordings came from genotype class with accuracies that were significantly improved relative to the no information rate, although EEG analyses showed more overlap between groups than respiratory plethysmography. In comparison, conventional methods where single features between animal classes were analyzed, differences between the genotypes tested using baseline neurophysiology measurements showed no statistical difference. However, ML/AI workflows successfully were capable of providing successful classification, indicating that interactions between features were different in these genotypes. ML/AI workflows provide new methodologies to interrogate neurophysiology data. However, their implementation must be done with care so as to provide high rigor and reproducibility between laboratories. We provide a series of recommendations on how to report the utilization of ML/AI workflows for the neurophysiology community. NEW & NOTEWORTHY ML/AI classification workflows are capable of providing insight into differences between genotypes for neurophysiology research. Analytical techniques utilized in the neurophysiology community can be augmented by implementing ML/AI workflows.

We introduced two different levels of vigilance state; alertness and vigilance decrement while subjects were performing Stroop Color-Word Task (SCWT) for approximately 45 minutes. We assessed the levels of vigilance by utilizing Eye tracking data and five machine learning (ML) classifiers. Our preprocessing pipeline consists of baseline correction, and artifacts, and noise removal. We extracted six features namely: fixation duration, pupil size, saccade duration, saccade amplitude, saccade velocity, and blink duration. These features were then used as an input to the five ML classifiers for vigilance level classification. We achieved the highest classification accuracy of 76.8% in differentiating between the two vigilance levels using all features with a selected Support vector machine classifier. Other classifiers have also achieved comparable accuracy.

Communication between humans and a drone using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the most challenging issues in the BCI domain. In particular, the control of drone swarms (the direction and formation) has more advantages compared to the control of a drone. The visual imagery (VI) paradigm is that subjects visually imagine specific objects or scenes. Reduction of the variability among subjects' EEG signals is essential for practical BCI-based systems. In this study, we proposed the subepoch-wise feature encoder (SEFE) to improve the performances in the subject-independent tasks by using the VI dataset. This study is the first attempt to demonstrate the possibility of generalization among subjects in the VI-based BCI. We used the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation for evaluating the performances. We obtained higher performances when including our proposed module than excluding our proposed module. The DeepConvNet with SEFE showed the highest performance of 0.72 among six different decoding models. Hence, we demonstrated the feasibility of decoding the VI dataset in the subject-independent task with robust performances by using our proposed module.

J	Hamlin, A; Kobylarz, E; Lever, JH; Taylor, S; Ray, L				Hamlin, Alexandra; Kobylarz, Erik; Lever, James H.; Taylor, Susan; Ray, Laura			Assessing the feasibility of detecting epileptic seizures using non-cerebral sensor data	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Biomedical computing; Decision-support systems; Wearable sensors; Machine learning; Biomedical signal processing		This paper investigates the feasibility of using non-cerebral, time-series data to detect epileptic seizures. Data were recorded from fifteen patients (7 male, 5 female, 3 not noted, mean age 36.17 yrs), five of whom had a total of seven seizures. Patients were monitored in an inpatient setting using standard video-electroencephalography (vEEG), while also wearing sensors monitoring electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, electromyography, accelerometry, and audio signals (vocalizations). A systematic and detailed study was conducted to identify the sensors and the features derived from the non-cerebral sensors that contribute most significantly to separability of data acquired during seizures from non-seizure data. Post-processing of the data using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) shows that seizure data are strongly separable from non-seizure data based on features derived from the signals recorded. The mean area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for each individual patient that experienced a seizure during data collection, calculated using LDA, was 0.9682. The features that contribute most significantly to seizure detection differ for each patient. The results show that a multimodal approach to seizure detection using the specified sensor suite is promising in detecting seizures with both sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the study provides a means to quantify the contribution of each sensor and feature to separability. Development of a non-electroencephalography (EEG) based seizure detection device would give doctors a more accurate seizure count outside of the clinical setting, improving treatment and the quality of life of epilepsy patients.

In recent years, the technology that has been used to study a person's behavior and emotions based on brain signals is the brain-computer interface (BCI). Although previous works have already proposed the classification of emotions in people with sensory disabilities using machine learning techniques, a model of recognition of emotions in people with visual disabilities has not yet been evaluated. Consequently, in this work, the authors present a twofold framework focused on people with visual disabilities. Firstly, auditory stimuli have been used, and a component of acquisition and extraction of brain signals has been defined. Secondly, analysis techniques for the modeling of emotions have been developed, and machine learning models for the classification of emotions have been defined. Based on the results, the algorithm with the best performance in the validation is random forest (RF), with an accuracy of 85 and 88% in the classification for negative and positive emotions, respectively. According to the results, the framework is able to classify positive and negative emotions, but the experimentation performed also shows that the framework performance depends on the number of features in the dataset and the quality of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a determining factor.

The electroencephalogram (EEG)-based mental state analysis method is an effective and objective way of detecting fatigue. However, as EEG shows significant differences across subjects, effectively "transfering" the EEG analysis model of the existing subjects to the EEG signals of other subjects is still a challenge. Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) has excellent performance in transfer learning, especially in the fields of document analysis and image recognition, but has not been applied directly in EEG-based cross-subject fatigue detection. In this paper, we present a DANN-based model, Generative-DANN (GDANN), which combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to enhance the ability by addressing the issue of different distribution of EEG across subjects. The comparative results show that in the analysis of cross-subject tasks, GDANN has a higher average accuracy of 91.63% in fatigue detection across subjects than those of traditional classification models, which is expected to have much broader application prospects in practical brain-computer interaction (BCI).

No objective, quantified evaluation has been made. This paper uses devises the synchronous bimodal signal collection and experimentation paradigm with electroencephalogram (EEG) and forehead high-density near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. The drug addicts are classified into mild, moderate and severe groups with reference to the suggestions of researchers and medical experts. Data of 45 drug addicts (mild: 15; moderate: 15; and severe: 15) is collected, and then used to design an addiction degree testing algorithm based on decision fusion. The algorithm is used to classify mild, moderate and severe addiction. This paper pioneers to use two types of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to abstract the EEG and NIR data of drug addicts, and introduces batch normalization to CNN, thus accelerating training process, reducing parameter sensitivity, and enhancing system robustness. The characteristics output by two CNNs are transformed into dimensions. Two new characteristics are assigned with a weight of 50% each. The data is used for decision fusion. In the networks, 27 subjects are used as training sets, 9 as validation sets, and 9 as testing sets. The 3-class accuracy remains to be 63.15%, preliminarily justifying this method as an effective approach to measure drug addiction degree. And the method is ready to use, objective, and offers results in real time.

Many researchers are striving to predict the individual's decision-making response(ie., acceptance or rejection) by processing electroencephalogram(EEG) trial-by-trial. In the study, we proposed a supervised learning approach, called regularized discriminative spatial network pattern(RDSNP), to predict individual responses with a small size of training data set. It constructs discriminative brain networks by calculating the phase lock value of different decision-making responses with single-trial EEG data. Then the single-trial spatial network topology was applied to extract the RDSNP features. Finally, a linear discriminate analysis(LDA) classifier was built on RDSNP features and used to predict individual decisions trial-by-trial. To verify the performance of RDSNP, we compared this approach with such widely used baseline feature extraction methods as event related potentials, network properties, principal component analysis in EEG signals of 16 subjects, which was acquired during the experiments of ultimatum game, in terms of accuracy and F1-score suggests that our approach achieve a better performance on predicting single-trial decisions.

Learners' emotions are crucial for e-learning system because they promote or restrain the learning. Many researchers have investigated the impacts of emotions in enhancing and maximizing e-learning outcomes. Several machine learning and deep learning approaches have also been proposed to achieve this goal. All such approaches are suitable for an offline mode, where the data for emotion classification are stored and can be accessed infinitely. However, these offline mode approaches are inappropriate for real-time emotion classification when the data are coming in a continuous stream and data can be seen to the model at once only. We also need real-time responses according to the emotional state. For this, we propose a real-time emotion classification system (RECS)-based Logistic Regression (LR) trained in an online fashion using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. The proposed RECS is capable of classifying emotions in real-time by training the model in an online fashion using an EEG signal stream. To validate the performance of RECS, we have used the DEAP data set, which is the most widely used benchmark data set for emotion classification. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively classify emotions in real-time from the EEG data stream, which achieved a better accuracy and F1-score than other offline and online approaches. The developed real-time emotion classification system is analyzed in an e-learning context scenario.

However, the classification performance of various combination methods of the features extracted from sEMG and EEG channels for seven gait phase recognition has yet to be discussed. This study investigates the effectiveness of various dimensions of feature sets with different neural network algorithms in multiclass discrimination of gait phases. There are thirty-seven feature sets (slope sign change (SSC) of eight sEMG and twenty-one EEG channels, mean absolute value (MAV) of eight sEMG channels) and three classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Kernel Support Vector Machine (KSVM)) were utilized. The thirtyseven one-dimensional and six two-dimensional feature sets were applied to LDA and KNN, twenty-onedimensional and thirty-seven-dimensional feature sets were applied to three optimized KSVM for gait phase recognition. We found that thirty-seven-dimensional feature sets with grid search KSVM achieved the highest classification accuracy (98.56 +/- 1.34 %) and the time consumption was 26.37 s. The average time consumption of two-dimensional feature sets with KNN was the shortest (0.33 s). The SSC of sEMG with wider values distributions than others obtained a high performance. This indicates the wider the value distribution of features, the better accuracy of gait recognition. The findings suggest that a multi-dimensional feature set composed of EEG and sEMG features with KSVM achieved good performance. Considering execution time and recognition rate, two-dimensional feature sets with KNN are suitable for online gait recognition, thirty-seven-dimensional feature sets with KSVM are more likely to be used for off-line gait analysis.

Most EEG systems are multi-channel in nature, but multiple channels might include noisy and redundant information and increase computational times of automated EEG decoding algorithms. To reduce the signal-to-noise ratio, improve accuracy and reduce computational time, one may combine channel selection with feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. However, as EEG signals present high inter-subject variability, we introduce a novel algorithm for subject-independent channel selection through representation learning of EEG recordings. The algorithm exploits channel-specific 1D-CNNs as supervised feature extractors to maximize class separability and reduces a high dimensional multi-channel signal into a unique 1-Dimensional representation from which it selects the most relevant channels for classification. The algorithm can be transferred to new signals from new subjects and obtain novel highly informative trial vectors of controlled dimensionality to be fed to any kind of classifier.

Thomas			Automatic identification of schizophrenia using EEG signals based on discrete wavelet transform and RLNDiP technique with ANN	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Relaxed local neighbour difference pattern&nbsp; (RLNDiP); Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Artificial neural network (ANN); Schizophrenia (ScZ)	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BINARY PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; CONNECTIVITY; COMPLEXITY; COHERENCE	Schizophrenia (ScZ) is a detrimental condition of the brain often associated with depression, anxiety, and socio-psychological problems. In the traditional diagnosis approach, the results are subjective, prone to error, and biased, as they solely depend on the subject's response and the psychiatrist's experience. Hence, in this work, to overcome the aforesaid problems a computer-aided diagnosis of ScZ from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using the novel relaxed local neighbour difference pattern (RLNDiP) technique is proposed. To seize the entire characteristics of disrupted connectivity in ScZ, the combination of RLNDiP features from both time domain (TD) and time-frequency domain (TFD) is proposed. In the TD, the proposed technique is employed to transform the EEG signals into the RLNDiP domain, by computing the RLNDiP code for each sample in the EEG signals. Secondly, the histogram features are computed from the RLNDiP domain. In the TFD, the discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose the signals into five brain rhythms, namely delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. In the next step, each brain rhythm is converted into the RLNDiP domain, and the histogram features are computed. The features extracted from different brain rhythms and the TD features are integrated using various fusion approaches for accurate discrimination of ScZ from normal subjects. The prominent features describing the effective connectivity is selected using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) and the selected features are fed into the artificial neural network (ANN), for automatic diagnosis of ScZ. The proposed approach attained a maximum accuracy of 100%, with the fusion of alpha brain rhythm and the TD features. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach attained a maximum classification performance.	[Sairamya, N.

Subjective diagnostic methods for ASD detection require lengthy questionnaires, trained medical personnel, and occupational therapists, and are subject to observer variability. Recent years have seen a rise in the usage of machine learning techniques for detecting ASD, which stems from a requirement for objective and accurate detection methods. This research analyzes the performance of various deep convolutional architectures for the detection of ASD. The primary objective of this work is to select a method capable of performing automatic feature extraction and classification with a relatively high degree of accuracy. Several experiments were conducted with different state-of-the-art deep architectures, out of which the ResNet50 performed the best, with an average accuracy of 81%. The performances of these architectures were analyzed in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.

Recently, DMD algorithm has successfully been applied to the analysis of non-stationary signals such as neural recordings. In this study, we propose single-channel, and multi-channel EEG based DMD approaches for the analysis of epileptic EEG signals. We investigate the possibility of utilizing the "DMD Spectrum" for the classification of pre-seizure and seizure EEG segments. We introduce higher-order DMD spectral moments and DMD sub-band powers, and extract them as features for the classification of epileptic EEG signals. Experiments are conducted on multi-channel EEG signals collected from 16 epilepsy patients. Single-channel, and multichannel EEG based DMD approaches have been tested on epileptic EEG data recorded from only right, only left, and both brain hemisphere channels. Performance of various classifiers using the proposed DMD-Spectral based features are compared with that of traditional spectral features. Experimental results reveal that the higher order DMD spectral moments and DMD sub-band power features introduced in this study, outperform the analogous spectral features calculated from traditional power spectrum.

In the context of deep learning, SPD matrix-based Riemannian networks have been shown to be a promising solution for classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, capturing the Riemannian geometry within their structured 2D feature representation. However, existing approaches usually learn spatial-temporal structures in an embedding space for all available EEG signals, and their optimization procedures rely on computationally expensive iterations. Furthermore, these approaches often struggle to encode all of the various types of relationships into a single distance metric, resulting in a loss of generality. To address the above limitations, we propose a Riemannian Embedding Banks method, which divides the problem of common spatial patterns learning in an entire embedding space into K-subproblems and builds one model for each subproblem, to be combined with SPD neural networks. By leveraging the concept of the "separate-to-learn" technology on a Riemannian manifold, REB divides the data and the embedding space into K non-overlapping subsets and learns K separate distance metrics in a Riemannian geometric space instead of the vector space. Then, the learned K non-overlapping subsets are grouped into neurons in the SPD neural network's embedding layer. Experimental results on public EEG datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach for learning common spatial patterns of EEG signals despite their non-stationary nature, increasing the convergence speed while maintaining generalization.

This study examines the predictive utility of NCAT in the classification of children with AD/HD Inattentive presentation. Method: Fifty three children with AD/HD Inattentive presentation and 161 typically-developing children completed an NCAT assessment. Discriminant function analyses examined group membership prediction for separate components of NCAT and for the components combined. Results: The combined model correctly classified 93.4 % of participants, with 91.4 % sensitivity and 93.9 % specificity. Contributions to classification were from SNAP-IV, psychological needs satisfaction, self-regulation, executive function performance, and EEG. The combined model resulted in a 9.3 % increase in specificity and 5.9 % increase in sensitivity compared to SNAP-IV alone. Conclusions: NCAT provides good discrimination between children with and without AD/HD of the Inattentive presentation, and further investigation including other subtypes and comorbidities is warranted.

However, the collection of substantial EEG data could be difficult owing to its randomness and non-stationary. Moreover, there is notable individual difference in EEG data, which affects the reusability and generalization of models. For mitigating the adverse effects from the above factors, transfer learning is applied in this field to transfer the knowledge learnt in one domain into a different but related domain. Transfer learning adjusts models with small-scale data of the task, and also maintains the learning ability with individual difference.

Early detection of one of its potential prodromal state, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), appears to be critical for early interventions. The present study, therefore, addressed the challenging issue of classifying individuals with MCI vs. healthy controls (HC) based on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, we design a feature extraction and feature fusion framework to extract discriminative features. In the first step, we extracted the sample entropy (SampEn) and Katz's fractal dimension (KFD) features from their corresponding best electrodes selected by a wrapper-based algorithm. Next, the two best feature sets were fused by a principal component analysis (PCA) method. The eigen-complexity pattern (ECP) feature extracted by this framework was subsequently fed into the proposed MCI detector, the conformal kernel-based fuzzy support vector machine (CKF-SVM). The CKF-SVM not only adopts a fuzzified penalty strategy to avoid the overfitting often observed in conventional SVM due to outliers, but also applies a conformally transformed kernel to further increase the class separability. The results carried out on 51 participants (24 MCI, 27 HC) and leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV) show that the ECP feature combined with a simple linear discriminant analysis classifier achieved an accuracy of 84.31%, higher than the one by either of the two complexity measures (SampEn and KFD), as well as the ones by spectral powers of different scalp regions. The results also show that CKF-SVM outperformed SVM and other classifiers commonly used in the MCI-HC classification studies. A high LOPO-CV accuracy 90.19% (sensitivity = 87.50%, specificity = 92.60%) was achieved by using the ECP feature and the CKF-SVM classifier. These results suggested that the proposed approach has a potential for developing a sensitive EEG-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that may, in the future, provide an objective measure to assist physicians' diagnose of MCI and even a neurofeedback brain-computer interface (BCI) system for monitoring the intervention response of individuals with MCI.

One major trend in construction research is quantitatively evaluating workers' psychophysiological states. With the advances in wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices, such assessment can be possible by interpreting workers' brainwave patterns. However, the recorded EEG signals are highly contaminated with signal noises, particularly ocular-related artifacts generated from blinking and eye movement. Although most of the noise can be suppressed by well-established filtering techniques, ocular artifacts cannot be eliminated easily and automatically by conventional techniques. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a procedure to reduce ocular artifacts by integrating dependence component analysis, image processing, and machine learning algorithms. The results demonstrated the potential of the proposed procedure to produce high-quality EEG signals accurately, continuously, and automatically during construction operations. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge by overcoming the barriers to reliable translation of EEG signals in numerous construction-related investigations, especially those that add substantially to the understanding of the effect of workplace stressors on workers' health and safety.

J	Borra, D; Fantozzi, S; Magosso, E				Borra, Davide; Fantozzi, Silvia; Magosso, Elisa			A Lightweight Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network for P300 Decoding: Analysis of Training Strategies and Uncovering of Network Decision	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; P300; convolutional neural networks; transfer learning; decision explanation; brain-computer interfaces	BRAIN; AUTISM	Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which automatically learn features from raw data to approximate functions, are being increasingly applied to the end-to-end analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, especially for decoding brain states in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Nevertheless, CNNs introduce a large number of trainable parameters, may require long training times, and lack in interpretability of learned features. The aim of this study is to propose a CNN design for P300 decoding with emphasis on its lightweight design while guaranteeing high performance, on the effects of different training strategies, and on the use of post-hoc techniques to explain network decisions. The proposed design, named MS-EEGNet, learned temporal features in two different timescales (i.e., multi-scale, MS) in an efficient and optimized (in terms of trainable parameters) way, and was validated on three P300 datasets. The CNN was trained using different strategies (within-participant and within-session, within-participant and cross-session, leave-one-subject-out, transfer learning) and was compared with several state-of-the-art (SOA) algorithms. Furthermore, variants of the baseline MS-EEGNet were analyzed to evaluate the impact of different hyper-parameters on performance. Lastly, saliency maps were used to derive representations of the relevant spatio-temporal features that drove CNN decisions. MS-EEGNet was the lightest CNN compared with the tested SOA CNNs, despite its multiple timescales, and significantly outperformed the SOA algorithms. Post-hoc hyper-parameter analysis confirmed the benefits of the innovative aspects of MS-EEGNet. Furthermore, MS-EEGNet did benefit from transfer learning, especially using a low number of training examples, suggesting that the proposed approach could be used in BCIs to accurately decode the P300 event while reducing calibration times. Representations derived from the saliency maps matched the P300 spatio-temporal distribution, further validating the proposed decoding approach. This study, by specifically addressing the aspects of lightweight design, transfer learning, and interpretability, can contribute to advance the development of deep learning algorithms for P300-based BCIs.

A multi-branch deep learning fusion model is proposed to identify epileptogenic signals from the epileptogenic area of the brain. The classical approach extracts multi-domain signal wave features to construct a time-series feature sequence and then abstracts it through the bi-directional long short-term memory attention machine (Bi-LSTM-AM) classifier. The deep learning approach uses raw time-series signals to build a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to achieve end-to-end deep feature extraction and signal detection. These two branches are integrated to obtain deep fusion features and results. Resampling is employed to split the imbalanced epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic samples into balanced subsets for clinical validation. The model is validated over two publicly available benchmark iEEG databases to verify its effectiveness on a private, large-scale, clinical stereo EEG database. The model achieves high sensitivity (97.78%), accuracy (97.60%), and specificity (97.42%) on the Bern-Barcelona database, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques. It is then demonstrated on a clinical dataset with an average intra-subject accuracy of 92.53% and cross-subject accuracy of 88.03%. The results suggest that the proposed method is a valuable and extremely robust approach to help researchers and clinicians develop an automated method to identify the source of iEEG signals.

First, we represent the multichannel EEG signal in 2D matrix form and then apply AM FM model to exploit the decomposed form of EEG. Thereafter, we construct the complexity coefficient using multiscale bubble entropy analysis from decomposed EEG wave. Then, second feature set is formed by using simple and efficient power procedure to obtain absolute power index and relative power index. Using two machine learning approaches, classification performance of proposed approach is explored to correctly identify the epileptic seizures. To show the robustness of multiscale bubble entropy, the stability analysis is performed with normal EEG dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed technique can effectively detect the epileptic seizures and achieve a superior classification performance with the ANN classifier compared to KNN classifier. This method provides higher discriminating capability with greater stability, so that they could detect wider range of seizure and thus help advance the current diagnosis system.

Theta power, among other neurological biomarkers, shows increased activity with increasing WM load. These correspondences frequently break down in individuals with cognitive decline, making WM load biomarkers a potentially valuable tool for early detection of cognitive impairment. However, such studies used multiple-channel EEG headsets, which are not easy to use and accessible. Here we used a single-channel EEG set (Aurora by Neurosteer (R)) and evaluated the ability of novel features, previously extracted on a different dataset, to serve as WM load biomarkers. In a single experiment, fourteen participants underscored the widely used n-back task while their brain activity was recorded with the mobile EEG device. Frontal theta power, as well as two novel features, significantly correlated with the levels of WM load. However, the two novel features exhibited higher sensitivity to lower WM load changes. These more sensitive biomarkers of WM load are a promising tool for mass screening of mild cognitive impairment.

We benefited from complexity and information concepts and ran the analysis on EEG and voice (audio) signals using sample entropy and Shannon entropy. To change brain activity, we applied four different odors with different complexities on ten subjects (5 M, 5 F). Accordingly, subjects' voice was changed, and therefore, we evaluated the changes in EEG versus voice signals by calculating their Shannon entropy and sample entropy. The obtained results showed that the variations of complexity (r = 0.8659) and the information content (r = 0.9423) of voice and EEG signals are strongly correlated. This method can be utilized to evaluate the coupling of other biosignals versus brain activity.

Adequately Wide 1D CNN facilitates improved EEG based Visual Object Recognition	29TH EUROPEAN SIGNAL PROCESSING CONFERENCE (EUSIPCO 2021)	European Signal Processing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	29th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	AUG 23-27, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	European Assoc Signal Proc		CNN; Wide; Residual; EEG; Representation	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Accurate classification of visual objects from Single-Trial EEG signals is a challenging task due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) associated with the brain signals. Recently, machine learning frameworks based on deep neural networks have shown great potential. Network architectures have grown increasingly complex with sophisticated modules to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Unfortunately, finding the optimal network configuration is a tedious trial-and-error process. In this work, we propose to use a wider version of the simple 1D - CNN architecture with residual connections for EEG based visual object recognition. Experimental results establish that this fairly simple architecture outperforms existing techniques across five different classification tasks.

There is important local structural information in the EEG signals, which is effective for classification; and this locality of EEG features not only exists in the spatial channel position but also exists in the frequency domain. In order to retain sufficient spatial structure and frequency information, we use one-versus-rest filter bank common spatial patterns (OVR-FBCSP) to preprocess the data and extract preliminary features. On this basis, we conduct research and discussion on feature extraction methods. One-dimensional feature extraction methods like linear discriminant analysis (LDA) may destroy this kind of structural information. Traditional manifold learning methods or two-dimensional feature extraction methods cannot extract both types of information at the same time. We introduced the bilinear structure and matrix-variate Gaussian model into two-dimensional discriminant locality preserving projection (2DDLPP) algorithm and decompose EEG signals into spatial and spectral parts. Afterwards, the most discriminative features were selected through a weight calculation method. We tested the method on BCI competition data sets 2a, data sets IIIa, and data sets collected by our laboratory, and the results were expressed in terms of recognition accuracy. The cross-validation results were 75.69%, 70.46%, and 54.49%, respectively. The average recognition accuracy of new method is improved by 7.14%, 7.38%, 4.86%, and 3.8% compared to those of LDA, two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA), discriminant locality property projections (DLPP), and 2DDLPP, respectively. Therefore, we consider that the proposed method is effective for EEG classification.

Patients with a BS pattern who were younger than 6 months old were screened from our electroencephalogram (EEG) database. The synchronized and symmetric BS patterns under different etiologies in epilepsy were analyzed. A total of 32 patients had a BS pattern on EEG. The etiologies included genetic disorders (37.5%), cortical malformations (28.1%), inborn errors of metabolism (12.5%), and unknown (21.9%). Twenty-five patients were diagnosed with Ohtahara syndrome, one as early myoclonic encephalopathy, and one as epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizure. Five cases could not be classified into any epileptic syndrome. Asynchronous BS pattern was identified in 18 cases, of which 13 (72%) patients had genetic and/or metabolic etiologies. Synchronous BS pattern was identified in 14 cases, of which 8 (57%) patients had structural etiologies. Twenty-three patients had symmetric BS patterns, of which 15 (65%) patients had genetic etiologies. Nine patients had asymmetric BS patterns, of which 8 (89%) patients had structural etiologies. Patients with genetic epilepsies tended to have asynchronous and symmetric BS patterns, whereas those with structural epilepsies were more likely to have synchronous and asymmetric BS patterns.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a very important tool in the study of epilepsy. It provides rich information that can not be provided by other physiological methods. In the automatic classification of EEG signals by intelligent algorithms, feature extraction and the establishment of classifiers are both very important steps. Different feature extraction methods, such as time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear dynamic feature methods, contain independent and diverse specific information. Using multiple forms of features at the same time can improve the accuracy of epilepsy recognition. In this paper, we apply metric learning to epileptic EEG signal recognition. Inspired by the equidistance constrained metric learning algorithm, we propose multifeature metric learning based on enhanced equidistance embedding (MMLE3) for EEG recognition of epilepsy. The MMLE3 algorithm makes use of various forms of EEG features, and the feature weights are adaptively weighted. It is a big advantage that the feature weight vector can be adjusted adaptively, without manual adjustment. The MMLE3 algorithm maximizes the distance between the samples constrained by the cannot-link, and the samples of different classes are transformed into equidistant; meanwhile, MMLE3 minimizes the distance between the data constrained by the must-link, and the samples of the same class are compressed to one point. Under the premise that the various feature classification tasks are consistent, MMLE3 can fully extract the associated and complementary information hidden between the features. The experimental results on the CHB-MIT dataset verify that the MMLE3 algorithm has good generalization performance.

Non-stationary EEG feature behavior is considered a major challenge and a lot of effort has been devoted to developing adaptive methods to accommodate for this non-stationarity. However, learning- and plasticity-related mechanisms throughout a BCI intervention are additional sources of non-stationarity, that even though expected, we know very little about. In this work, we explore the evolution of Motor Imagery (MI) information extraction across multiple sessions, in two stroke patients, using a fixed and an adaptive Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. We show different behavior of the fixed SVM model for the two patients, indicating that for one patient, relevant MI-related EEG features shifted throughout the intervention. This observation calls for further investigations to better understand the evolution and shift of features across sessions, as well as the impact of using adaptive methods from a clinical outcome perspective.

However, the need to implant objects limits the applications of invasive approach [8]. Several non-invasive neuroimaging modalities have garnered increasing attention in BCIs such as electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional We propose an effective and practical decoding method of different mental states for potential applications for the design of brain-computer interfaces, prediction of cognitive behaviour, and investigation of cognitive mechanism. Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals that interrogated the prefrontal and parietal cortices and were evaluated by generalized linear model were recorded when nineteen healthy adults performed the operation span (OSPAN) task. The oxygenated hemoglobin changes during OSPAN, response, and rest periods were classified with a support vector machine (SVM). The relevance vector regression algorithm was utilized for prediction of cognitive performance based on multidomain features of fNIRS signals from the OSPAN task. We acquired decent classification accuracies for OSPAN vs. response (above 91.2%) and for OSPAN vs. rest (above 94.7%). Eight of the ten cognitive testing scores could be predicted from the combination of OSPAN and response features, which indicated the brain hemodynamic responses contain meaningful information suitable for predicting cognitive performance.

Recent years have seen a rise in the number of children with autism. Since this could have serious health and socioeconomic consequences, it is imperative to investigate how to develop strategies for an early diagnosis that might pave the way to an adequate intervention. In this study, the phase-based functional brain connectivity derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) in a machine learning framework was used to classify the children with autism and typical children in an experimentally obtained data set of 12 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 12 typical children. Specifically, the functional brain connectivity networks have quantitatively been characterized by graph-theoretic parameters computed from three proposed approaches based on a standard phase-locking value, which were used as the features in a machine learning environment. Our study was successfully classified between two groups with approximately 95.8% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 92% specificity through the trial-averaged phase-locking value (PLV) approach and cubic support vector machine (SVM). This work has also shown that significant changes in functional brain connectivity in ASD children have been revealed at theta band using the aggregated graph-theoretic features. Therefore, the findings from this study offer insight into the potential use of functional brain connectivity as a tool for classifying ASD children.

Here, we propose the combination of corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and intermuscular coherence (IMC) as control features for a novel hybrid BCI for rehabilitation purposes. Multiple electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and surface electromyography (EMG) from 5 muscles per side were collected in 20 healthy participants performing finger extension (Ext) and grasping (Grasp) with both dominant and non-dominant hand. Grand average of CMC and IMC patterns showed a bilateral sensorimotor area as well as multiple muscles involvement. CMC and IMC values were used as features to classify each task versus rest and Ext versus Grasp. We demonstrated that a combination of CMC and IMC features allows for classification of both movements versus rest with better performance (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, AUC) for the Ext movement (0.97) with respect to Grasp (0.88). Classification of Ext versus Grasp also showed high performances (0.99). All in all, these preliminary findings indicate that the combination of CMC and IMC could provide for a comprehensive framework for simple hand movements to eventually be employed in a hybrid BCI system for post-stroke rehabilitation.

Although it is simple to define emotions that can be expressed physically such as speech, facial expressions, and gestures, it is more difficult to define psychological emotions that are expressed internally. The most important stimuli in revealing inner emotions are aural and visual stimuli. In this study, EEG signals using both aural and visual stimuli were examined and emotions were evaluated in both binary and multi-class emotion recognitions models. A general emotion recognition model was proposed for non-subject based classification. Unlike previous studies, a subject-based testing was carried out for the first time on the GAMEEMO dataset. Capsule Networks, a new neural network model, has been developed for binary and multi-class emotion recognition. In the proposed method, a novel fusion strategy was introduced for binary-class emotion recognition and the model was tested using the GAMEEMO dataset. Binary-class emotion recognition achieved a classification accuracy which was 10% better than the classification performance achieved in other studies in the literature. Based on these findings, we suggest that the proposed method will bring a different perspective to emotion recognition.

Motor rehabilitation aims at restoring it, either by re-establishing "close-to-normal" connectivity or supporting the development of alternative pathways. With the ultimate aim to design a rehabilitative approach based on a combination of Electroencephalographic (EEG) and Electromyographic (EMG) signals, we studied how different processing pipelines affect the extraction of a potential hybrid feature to discriminate movement tasks. Such feature will be employed in a novel hybrid Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system for motor-rehabilitation. In this setting, the control feature will be derived from a combined EEG and EMG connectivity pattern estimated online during upper limb movement attempts.

Most AAD methods have been investigated for an open-loop scenario, where AAD is performed in an offline fashion without presenting online feedback to the listener. In this work, we aim at developing a closed-loop AAD system that allows to enhance a target speaker, suppress an interfering speaker and switch attention between both speakers. To this end, we propose a cognitive-driven adaptive gain controller (AGC) based on real-time AAD. Using the EEG responses of the listener and the speech signals of both speakers, the real-time AAD generates probabilistic attention measures, based on which the attended and the unattended speaker are identified. The AGC then amplifies the identified attended speaker and attenuates the identified unattended speaker, which are presented to the listener via loudspeakers. We investigate the performance of the proposed system in terms of the decoding performance and the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) improvement. The experimental results show that, although there is a significant delay to detect attention switches, the proposed system is able to improve the SIR between the attended and the unattended speaker. In addition, no significant difference in decoding performance is observed between closed-loop AAD and open-loop AAD. The subjective evaluation results show that the proposed closed-loop cognitive-driven system demands a similar level of cognitive effort to follow the attended speaker, to ignore the unattended speaker and to switch attention between both speakers compared to using open-loop AAD. Closed-loop AAD in an online fashion is feasible and enables the listener to interact with the AGC.

Yet, identifying emotions using only brainwaves is still very challenging, especially the subject-independent task. Numerous studies have tried to propose methods to recognize emotions, including machine learning techniques like convolutional neural network (CNN). Since CNN has shown its potential in generalization to unseen subjects, manipulating CNN hyperparameters like the window size and electrode order might be beneficial. To our knowledge, this is the first work that extensively observed the parameter selection effect on the CNN. The temporal information in distinct window sizes was found to significantly affect the recognition performance, and CNN was found to be more responsive to changing window sizes than the support vector machine. Classifying the arousal achieved the best performance with a window size of ten seconds, obtaining 56.85% accuracy and a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.1369. Valence recognition had the best performance with a window length of eight seconds at 73.34% accuracy and an MCC value of 0.4669. Spatial information from varying the electrode orders had a small effect on the classification. Overall, valence results had a much more superior performance than arousal results, which were, perhaps, influenced by features related to brain activity asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres.

Machine learning methods are being used to optimize for the identification of these inhibiting factors. To do so, three types of data were used: biographic features, physiological signals and vehicle information of 68 participants are being utilized to identify the normal and loaded behaviors. This research, therefore, concentrates on driving behavior analysis using a new automated hybrid framework for detection of performance degradation of drivers due to distraction. The proposed model contains a hybrid of extreme learning neural network, as an ensemble learning method and evolutionary algorithms, to determine the weights of classifiers, for combining several traditional classifiers. The obtained results showcase that the proposed model yields outstanding performance than the other applied methods.

Objective: In this paper, we proposed a new transfer learning algorithm, which can utilize the labeled motor imagery (MI) EEG data at the previous time to achieve better classification accuracies for a small number of labeled EEG signals at the current time. Methods: We introduced an adaptive layer into the full connection layer of a deep convolution neural network. The objective function of the adaptive layer was designed to minimize the Local Maximum Mean Discrepancy (LMMD) and the prediction error while minimizing the distance within each class (DWC) and maximizing the distance between classes within each domain (DBCWD). We verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on two public datasets. Results: The classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm was higher than other comparison algorithms, and the paired t-test results also showed that the performance of the proposed algorithm was significantly different from that of other algorithms. The results of the confusion matrix and feature visualization showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Conclusion: Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy than other algorithms when there was only a small amount of labeled MI EEG data at the current time. It can be promising to be applied to the field of BCI.

In a recent classification of periodic patterns, TWs were formally grouped with the generalized periodic discharges, which are often associated with ictal activity. The interpretation of generalized periodic patterns with TWs as nonictal can have significant implications in the management of comatose patients in nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Electrographic characteristics that help distinguish nonictal periodic patterns with TWs from generalized periodic discharge ictal patterns include (1) TWs in long runs of periodic bilaterally synchronous and symmetric discharges, maximal in frontocentral or posterior head regions with and without a frontal-to-occipital lag or posterior-to-anterior lag, respectively; (2) recurrent spontaneous and/or low-dose benzodiazepine-induced attenuation and/or suppression of the periodic pattern and replacement with a diffuse slow wave activity throughout a prolonged EEG recording; and (3) stimulation-induced activation and/or increase in frequency and/or organization of TWs. We coined the term of status triphasicus to describe the electrographic periodic pattern of TWs with these three distinct characteristics. In this article, we discuss the advantages and limitations of keeping the status triphasicus pattern as a distinct electrographic entity different from periodic ictal generalized periodic discharge patterns. We discuss the circumstances in which a status triphasicus pattern can be associated with ictal activity and propose a simple pragmatic classification of status triphasicus that encompasses the different clinical scenarios it can be associated with.

However, in modern society, more and more diseases threaten the health of the brain and nerves and spinal cord, making the human brain unable to conduct normal information interaction with the outside world. The rehabilitation training of the brain-computer interface can promote the nerve repair of the sensorimotor cortex in patients with brain diseases. Therefore, the research of brain-computer interface for motor imaging is of great significance for patients with brain diseases to restore motor function. Due to the characteristics of non-stationary, nonlinear, and individual differences of EEG signals, there are still many difficulties in the analysis and classification of EEG signals at this stage. In this study, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model was used to classify motor-imaging EEG signals, identify the user's intention, and control external devices. Considering that single-modal features cannot represent the core information, this study uses a fusion feature that combines temporal and spatial features as the final feature data. The fusion features are input to the trained ELM classifier, and the final classification result is obtained. Two sets of BCI competition data in the BCI competition public database are used to verify the validity of the model. The experimental results show that the ELM model has achieved a classification accuracy of 0.7832 in the classification task of Data Sets IIb, which is higher than other comparison algorithms, and shows universal applicability among different subjects. In addition, the average recognition rate of this model in the Data Sets IIIa classification task reaches 0.8347, which has obvious advantages compared with the comparative classification algorithm. The classification effect is smaller than the classification effect obtained by the champion algorithm of the same project, which has certain reference value.

In this paper, we investigated decoding five different reach-and-grasp movements closely related to daily life using movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs). In the experiment, nine healthy subjects were asked to naturally execute five different reach-and-grasp movements on the designed experimental platform, namely palmar, pinch, push, twist, and plug grasp. A total of 480 trials per subject (80 trials per condition) were recorded. The MRCPs amplitude from low-frequency (0.3-3 Hz) EEG signals were used as decoding features for further offline analysis. Average binary classification accuracy for grasping vs. the no-movement condition peaked at 75.06 +/- 6.8%. Peak average accuracy for grasping vs. grasping conditions of 64.95 +/- 7.4% could be reached. Grand average peak accuracy of multiclassification for five grasping conditions reached 36.7 +/- 6.8% at 1.45 s after the movement onset. The analysis of MRCPs indicated that all the grasping conditions are more pronounced than the no-movement condition, and there are also significant differences between the grasping conditions. These findings clearly proved the feasibility of decoding multiple reach-and-grasp actions from noninvasive EEG signals. This work is significant for the natural and intuitive BCI application, particularly for neuroprosthesis control or developing an active human-machine interaction system, such as rehabilitation robot.

Epilepsy after congenital zika virus infection: EEG and neuroimaging features	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; Congenital zika virus infection; Childhood	ILAE COMMISSION; INFANTS; CLASSIFICATION; OUTBREAK	Purpose: To describe epilepsy after congenital Zika virus infection (ZIKV) and its relationship with structural neuroimaging findings. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in children (aged 13-42 months) who were born with microcephaly due to ZIKV infection between 2015-2017. Patients underwent a brain imaging scan (magnetic resonance) and a video-EEG study. Results: Among the patients (n = 43), 55.8 % were male, 88.4 % were born at term, mean head circumference at the birth was 29.7 1.8 cm, and 44.8 % were infected in the first trimester of pregnancy. Neuroimaging was moderately abnormal in 30.2 % and severely abnormal in 46.5 % of patients. Early seizures (<6 months of age) were observed in 41.9 %. EEG background was abnormal when asleep or awake in 72.1 % and during sleep in 62.8 %. The interictal epileptogenic activity was recorded on 41/43 of the EEGs and was predominantly multifocal (62.8 %). An ictal EEG was obtained in 22 patients and 31.8 % had more than one seizure type. Sleep EEG (background) patterns, interictal epileptogenic activity (p = 0.046), interictal discharge localization (p = 0.015), type of ictal epileptogenic activity (p = 0.002), and localization of ictal discharge (p = 0.024) were significantly different between neuroimaging groups. The mild neuroimaging group had a higher chance of having more frequently normal sleep EEG patterns, no interictal epileptogenic activity and a further increase in the probability of walking without limitations, and less neurodevelopment delay. Conclusion: In patients with congenital Zika virus syndrome, epilepsy tended to be early and refractory. EEG features correlated with degree of neuroimaging abnormalities.

Yet, in many instances, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) rely on simple classification methods, circumventing deep neural networks (DNNs) due to limited training data. This paper leverages the robustness of several important results in non-parametric regression to harness the potentials of deep learning in limited data setups. We consider a solution that combines Pinsker's theorem as well as its adaptively optimal counterpart due to James-Stein for feature extraction from LFPs, followed by a DNN for classifying motor intentions. We apply our approach to the problem of decoding eye movement intentions from LFPs collected in macaque cortex while the animals perform memory-guided visual saccades to one of eight target locations. The results demonstrate that a DNN classifier trained over the Pinsker features outperforms the benchmark method based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) trained over the same features.

We computed sample entropy (SampEn), permutation entropy (PEn), and spectral entropy (SpEn) measures to reflect the signals' complexity and the graph-theoretic parameters derived from weighted phase-lag index (WPLI) to measure functional brain connectivity. Both feature sets were calculated in the noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) domain to characterize the tempo-spectral integration of information and thus provide novel insight into the brain dynamics. Statistical analysis results showed a general abnormality in the EEG of individuals with CP at the alpha-band component. Particularly, complexity measures were decreased, and graph-theoretic parameters specified by the diameter feature were increased in infants with CP compared to those with normal neurology. The proposed set of features have also been evaluated using the random under-sampling boosting (RUSBoost) classifier, which was trained and tested on the feature vectors of a cohort of 26 infants - 6 who developed CP by the age of 24 months and 20 with normal neuromotor outcome. A good performance of 84.6% classification accuracy (ACC), 83% sensitivity (SNS), 85% specificity (SPC) and 0.87 area under curve (AUC) was obtained using the entropy features extracted from the alpha-band component. A close result of 80.8% ACC, 67% SNS, 85% SPC and 0.79 AUC was also achieved using the diameter feature calculated from the same frequency range. Therefore, it was concluded that the obtained brain functions' characteristics successfully discriminate between the two groups of infants. These characteristics could be considered potential biomarkers of cerebral cellular damage and, therefore, could be employed in practical clinical applications for early CP prediction.

A Novel Local Ablation Approach for Explaining Multimodal Classifiers	2021 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING (IEEE BIBE 2021)	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	21st IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (IEEE BIBE)	OCT 25-27, 2021	Kragujevac, SERBIA	IEEE, Minist Educ Sci & Technol Dev Republ Serbia, Res & Dev Ctr Bioengineering BioIRC, Univ Kragujevac		Multimodal Classification; Sleep Scoring; Local Explainability; Deep Learning		With the growing use of multimodal data for deep learning classification in healthcare research, more studies are presenting explainability methods for insight into multimodal classifiers. Among these studies, few utilize local explainability methods, which can provide (1) insight into the classification of samples over time and (2) better understanding of the effects of demographic and clinical variables upon patterns learned by classifiers. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first local explainability approach for insight into the importance of each modality to the classification of samples over time. Our approach uses ablation, and we demonstrate how it can show the importance of each modality to the correct classification of each class. We further present a novel analysis that explores the effects of demographic and clinical variables upon the multimodal patterns learned by the classifier. As a use-case, we train a convolutional neural network for automated sleep staging with electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram (EMG) data. We find that EEG is the most important modality across most stages, though EOG is particularly important for non-rapid eye movement stage 1. Further, we identify significant relationships between the local explanations and subject age, sex, and state of medication which suggest that the classifier learned features associated with these variables across multiple modalities and correctly classified samples. Our novel explainability approach has implications for many fields involving multimodal classification. Moreover, our examination of the degree to which demographic and clinical variables may affect classifiers could provide direction for future studies in automated biomarker discovery.

With the redundant information and noise, EEG signals cannot be easily converted into separable features through feature extraction algorithms. Channel selection algorithms are proposed to address the issue, in which the filtering technique is widely used with the advantages of low computational cost and strong practicability. In this study, we proposed several improved methods for filtering channel selection algorithm. Specifically, based on the coefficient of variation and inter-class distance, a novel channel classification method was designed, which divided channels into different categories based on their contribution to feature extraction process. Then a filtering channel selection algorithm was proposed according to the previous classification method. Moreover, a new testing framework for filtering channel selection algorithms was proposed, which can better reflect the generalization ability of the algorithm. Experimental results indicated that the proposed channel classification method is effective, and the proposed testing framework is better than the original one. Meanwhile, the proposed channel selection algorithm achieved the accuracy of 87.7% and 81.7% in two BCI competition datasets, respectively, which was superior to competing algorithms.

Spatio-temporal (ST) signal processing, which encompasses biosignals such as electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG), is one family of applications that could benefit from an HDC-based learning framework. At the core of HDC lie manipulations and comparisons of large bit patterns, which are inherently ill-suited to conventional computing platforms based on the von-Neumann architecture. In this work, we propose an architecture for ST signal processing within the HDC framework using predominantly in-memory compute arrays. In particular, we introduce a methodology for the in-memory hyperdimensional encoding of ST data to be used together with an in-memory associative search module. We show that the in-memory HDC encoder for ST signals offers at least 1.80x energy efficiency gains, 3.36x area gains, as well as 9.74x throughput gains compared with a dedicated digital hardware implementation. At the same time it achieves a peak classification accuracy within 0.04% of that of the baseline HDC framework.

J	Salankar, N; Koundal, D; Qaisar, SM				Salankar, Nilima; Koundal, Deepika; Mian Qaisar, Saeed			Stress Classification by Multimodal Physiological Signals Using Variational Mode Decomposition and Machine Learning	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article							EEG; TASK	In this pandemic situation, importance and awareness about mental health are getting more attention. Stress recognition from multimodal sensor based physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals is a very cost-effective way due to its noninvasive nature. A dataset, recorded during the mental arithmetic task, consisting of EEG + ECG signals of 36 participants is used. It contains two categories of performance, namely, "Good" (nonstressed) and "Bad" (stressed) (Gupta et al. 2018 and Eraldeir et al. 2018). This paper presents an effective approach for the recognition of stress marker at frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes. It processes the multimodality physiological signals. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) strategy is used for data preprocessing and for the decomposition of signals into various oscillatory mode functions. Poincare plots (PP) are derived from the first eight variational modes and features from these plots have been extracted such as mean, area, and central tendency measure of the elliptical region. The statistical significance of the extracted features with p < 0.5 has been performed using the Wilcoxson test. The multilayer perceptron (MPLN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are used for the classification of stress and nonstress categories. MLPN has achieved the maximum accuracies of 100% for frontal and temporal lobes. The suggested method can be incorporated in noninvasive EEG signal processing based automated stress identification systems.

It is necessary to effectively and accurately recognize the lower limb motor imagery through Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as quickly as possible with the best possible combination of feature extraction and classification algorithms with maximum accuracy in the least time. Hence, an optimum option needs to be reached and so in this work, a combination of using Frequency Domain Common Spatial Pattern (FDCSP) for feature extraction and classification by SVM of two-class motor imagery which is left and right foot is proposed. Classical CSPs may often not retain the discriminatory functions among classes in the time domain. Therefore, the work to reduce the limitations of traditional CSP we have introduced a frequency domain CSP (FDCSP) technique and a set of features are selected for further process. Significant feature vectors are then applied to train SVM by which the right and left foot motor imagery movement have been differentiated. The average classification accuracy by using SVM has given the best result of 85 percent whereas for kNN the accuracy is 77%. Comparing with the other CSP methods it has been demonstrated that FDCSP outperforms other state of art methods. The attained results demonstrate that the frame described can be used as a tool to promote discrimination against lower limb motor imagery movement.

Drowsiness-related road accidents lead to severe trauma, economic consequences, impact on others, physical injury and/or even death. Real-time and accurate driver drowsiness detection and warnings systems are necessary schemes to reduce tiredness-related driving accident rates. The research presented here aims at the classification of drowsy and non-drowsy driver states based on respiration rate detection by non-invasive, non-touch, impulsive radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar. Chest movements of 40 subjects were acquired for 5 m using a lab-placed IR-UWB radar system, and respiration per minute was extracted from the resulting signals. A structured dataset was obtained comprising respiration per minute, age and label (drowsy/non-drowsy). Different machine learning models, namely, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic regression, Gradient Boosting Machine, Extra Tree Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron were trained on the dataset, amongst which the Support Vector Machine shows the best accuracy of 87%. This research provides a ground truth for verification and assessment of UWB to be used effectively for driver drowsiness detection based on respiration.

J	Furui, A; Igaue, T; Tsuji, T				Furui, Akira; Igaue, Takuya; Tsuji, Toshio			EMG pattern recognition via Bayesian inference with scale mixture-based stochastic generative models	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electromyogram (EMG); Pattern recognition; Motion classification; Scale mixture model; Bayesian inference	CLASSIFICATION SCHEME; MYOELECTRIC CONTROL; SIGNALS; PROBABILITY; CLASSIFIERS; EEG	Electromyogram (EMG) has been utilized to interface signals for prosthetic hands and information devices owing to its ability to reflect human motion intentions. Although various EMG classification methods have been introduced into EMG-based control systems, they do not fully consider the stochastic characteristics of EMG signals. This paper proposes an EMG pattern classification method incorporating a scale mixture-based generative model. A scale mixture model is a stochastic EMG model in which the EMG variance is considered as a random variable, enabling the representation of uncertainty in the variance. This model is extended in this study and utilized for EMG pattern classification. The proposed method is trained by variational Bayesian learning, thereby allowing the automatic determination of the model complexity. Furthermore, to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed method with a partial discriminative approach, a mutual information-based determination method is introduced. Simulation and EMG analysis experiments demonstrated the relationship between the hyperparameters and classification accuracy of the proposed method as well as the validity of the proposed method. The comparison using public EMG datasets revealed that the proposed method outperformed the various conventional classifiers. These results indicated the validity of the proposed method and its applicability to EMG-based control systems. In EMG pattern recognition, a classifier based on a generative model that reflects the stochastic characteristics of EMG signals can outperform the conventional general-purpose classifier.

Although deep learning approaches have demonstrated efficiency in processing extracranial EEG, few studies have addressed iEEG seizure detection, in part due to the small number of seizures per patient typically available from intracranial investigations. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of deep learning methodology in detecting iEEG seizures using a large dataset of ictal patterns collected from epilepsy patients implanted with a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS). Methods: Five thousand two hundred and twenty-six ictal events were collected from 22 patients implanted with RNS. A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was created to provide personalized seizure annotations for each patient. Accuracy of seizure identification was tested in two scenarios: patients with seizures occurring following a period of chronic recording (scenario 1) and patients with seizures occurring immediately following implantation (scenario 2). The accuracy of the CNN in identifying RNS-recorded iEEG ictal patterns was evaluated against human neurophysiology expertise. Statistical performance was assessed via the area-under-precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Results: In scenario 1, the CNN achieved a maximum mean binary classification AUPRC of 0.84 +/- 0.19 (95%CI, 0.72-0.93) and mean regression accuracy of 6.3 +/- 1.0 s (95%CI, 4.3-8.5 s) at 30 seed samples. In scenario 2, maximum mean AUPRC was 0.80 +/- 0.19 (95%CI, 0.68-0.91) and mean regression accuracy was 6.3 +/- 0.9 s (95%CI, 4.8-8.3 s) at 20 seed samples. We obtained near-maximum accuracies at seed size of 10 in both scenarios. CNN classification failures can be explained by ictal electro-decrements, brief seizures, single-channel ictal patterns, highly concentrated interictal activity, changes in the sleep-wake cycle, and progressive modulation of electrographic ictal features. Conclusions: We developed a deep learning neural network that performs personalized detection of RNS-derived ictal patterns with expert-level accuracy. These results suggest the potential for automated techniques to significantly improve the management of closed-loop brain stimulation, including during the initial period of recording when the device is otherwise naive to a given patient's seizures.

The question of whether there exists a brain pattern associated with a specific emotion is the theme of many affective neuroscience studies. In this work, we bring to bear graph signal processing (GSP) techniques to tackle the problem of automatic emotion recognition using brain signals. GSP is an extension of classical signal processing methods to complex networks where there exists an inherent relation graph. With the help of GSP, we propose a new framework for learning class-specific discriminative graphs. To that end, firstly we assume for each class of observations there exists a latent underlying graph representation. Secondly, we consider the observations are smooth on their corresponding class-specific sough graph while they are non-smooth on other classes' graphs. The learned class-specific graph-based representations can act as sub-dictionaries and be utilized for the task of emotion classification. Applying the proposed method on an electroencephalogram (EEG) emotion recognition dataset indicates the superiority of our framework over other state-of-the-art methods.

This division method has a big classification and labeling defect, and the influence of emotion stimulation material on the subjects cannot be accurately measured. To address this problem, this paper proposes an EEG emotion recognition algorithm (DW-FBCSP: Distance Weighted Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern) based on scale distance weighted optimization to optimize the classification according to the distance of the scores from ideal center. This method is a natural extension of CSP that optimize the user's EEG signal projection matrix. Then, the LDA classifier is used to recognize emotions using the features set which fused the selected features and the features extracted by the projection matrix. The results show that the mean correct rate of the valence and arousal achieves 81.14% and 84.45% using the DEAP dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms better than some other results published in recent years.

In many real-world decision tasks, the information available to the decision maker is incomplete. To account for this uncertainty, we associate a degree of confidence to every decision, representing the likelihood of that decision being correct. In this study, we analyse electroencephalography (EEG) data from 68 participants undertaking eight different perceptual decision-making experiments. Our goals are to investigate (1) whether subject- and task-independent neural correlates of decision confidence exist, and (2) to what degree it is possible to build brain computer interfaces that can estimate confidence on a trial-by-trial basis. The experiments cover a wide range of perceptual tasks, which allowed to separate the task-related, decision-making features from the task-independent ones. Approach. Our systems train artificial neural networks to predict the confidence in each decision from EEG data and response times. We compare the decoding performance with three training approaches: (1) single subject, where both training and testing data were acquired from the same person; (2) multi-subject, where all the data pertained to the same task, but the training and testing data came from different users; and (3) multi-task, where the training and testing data came from different tasks and subjects. Finally, we validated our multi-task approach using data from two additional experiments, in which confidence was not reported. Main results. We found significant differences in the EEG data for different confidence levels in both stimulus-locked and response-locked epochs. All our approaches were able to predict the confidence between 15% and 35% better than the corresponding reference baselines. Significance. Our results suggest that confidence in perceptual decision making tasks could be reconstructed from neural signals even when using transfer learning approaches. These confidence estimates are based on the decision-making process rather than just the confidence-reporting process.

J	Hu, JC; Zhang, HY				Hu Jingchao; Zhang, Haiying			Recognition of classroom student state features based on deep learning algorithms and machine learning	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Deep learning; machine learning; student state; online recognition; feature recognition	MOTION CAPTURE DATA; MODEL	The difficulty in class student state recognition is how to make feature judgments based on student facial expressions and movement state. At present, some intelligent models are not accurate in class student state recognition. In order to improve the model recognition effect, this study builds a two-level state detection framework based on deep learning and HMM feature recognition algorithm, and expands it as a multi-level detection model through a reasonable state classification method. In addition, this study selects continuous HMM or deep learning to reflect the dynamic generation characteristics of fatigue, and designs random human fatigue recognition experiments to complete the collection and preprocessing of EEG data, facial video data, and subjective evaluation data of classroom students. In addition to this, this study discretizes the feature indicators and builds a student state recognition model. Finally, the performance of the algorithm proposed in this paper is analyzed through experiments. The research results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has certain advantages over the traditional algorithm in the recognition of classroom student state features.

This study explores extant electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in search of patterns that could differentiate subjects undertaking mental tasks and reveals insights on said data. We estimated the power spectral density of the signals and found that the subjects showed stronger gamma brain waves during activity while presenting alpha waves at rest. We also found that subjects who performed better in those tasks seemed to present less power density in high-frequency ranges, which could imply decreased brain activity during tasks. In a time-domain analysis, we used Hall-Wood and Robust-Genton estimators along with the Hurst exponent by means of a detrented fluctuation analysis and found that the first two fractal measures are capable of better differentiating signals between the rest and activity datasets. The statistical results indicated that the brain region corresponding to Fp channels might be more suitable for analysing EEG data from patients conducting arithmetic tasks. In summary, both frequency- and time-based methods employed in the study provided useful insights and should be preferably used together in EEG analysis.

Semi-dilated convolutional neural networks for epileptic seizure prediction	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure prediction; EEG; Semi-dilated convolution; Wavelet transform	DRUG-RESISTANT EPILEPSY; EEG; WAVELET; TERM	Epilepsy is a neurological brain disorder that affects similar to 75 million people worldwide. Predicting epileptic seizures holds great potential for improving the quality of life of people with epilepsy, but seizure prediction solely from the Electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging. Classical machine learning algorithms and a variety of feature engineering methods have become a mainstay in seizure prediction, yet performance has been variable. In this work, we first propose an efficient data pre-processing method that maps the time-series EEG signals into an image-like format (a ''scalogram'') using continuous wavelet transform. We then develop a novel convolution module named ''semi-dilated convolution'' that better exploits the geometry of wavelet scalograms and nonsquare-shape images. Finally, we propose a neural network architecture named ''semi-dilated convolutional network (SDCN)'' that uses semi-dilated convolutions to solely expand the receptive field along the long dimension (image width) while maintaining high resolution along the short dimension (image height). Results demonstrate that the proposed SDCN architecture outperforms previous seizure prediction methods, achieving an average seizure prediction sensitivity of 98.90% for scalp EEG and 88.45-89.52% for invasive EEG.

Automatic Sleep Stage Identification with Time Distributed Convolutional Neural Network	2021 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUL 18-22, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc		Polysomnography; Sleep stage identification; Time-Distributed Convolutional Neural Network	OPTIMAL COMBINATION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; DISCRIMINATION	Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep stage classification, requires a sleep expert for scoring and is both resource-intensive and expensive. Many researchers currently focus on the real-time classification of the sleep stages based on biomedical signals, such as Electroencephalograph (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG). However, most of the research work is based on machine learning models with multiple signal inputs or hand-engineered features requiring prior knowledge of the sleep domain. We propose a novel encoded Time-Distributed Convolutional Neural Network (TDConvNet) to automatically classify sleep stages based on a single raw PSG signal. The TDConvNet can infer sleep stages in just 30-second epochs for the 5-stage sleep classification using a single EEG or EOG signal from the open Sleep-EDF dataset. We evaluated the TDConvNet performance on EEGs and EOG signals. The evaluation results show that the proposed method achieved the best performance with the EEG Fpz-Cz signal (0.85) compared to current literature, followed by EEG Pz-Oz (0.84) and EOG horizontal (0.82).

In the analysis of EEG signals acquired directly from the scalp, feature extraction and classification techniques play a key role in motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. Typically, the high-density EEG system used in this process is composed of 64 or more channels for EEG signal recordings. However, in practical applications, fewer channels are required for the system set up. Thus, for the current study, we aim to determine the optimal number of channels for the BCI system. We propose a channel selection strategy known as neuro-evolutionary algorithm, which is based on modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO), coupled with feature extraction by common spatial pattern. To validate the proposed method, we performed experiments using 64 channel EEG recordings from four trans-humeral amputees. The acquired signals from five motor imagery tasks were fed into a wrapper based neuro-evolutionary framework after the extraction stage. The performance results of the MPSO, when compared with other models like ant colony, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing, demonstrate the superiority of MPSO as the best performance with the most significant results. Further validation with electrocorticogram (ECoG) dataset IV of the BCI competition showed that the proposed model outperformed other commonly used methods by significantly decreasing the error rate and the number of EEG channels.
