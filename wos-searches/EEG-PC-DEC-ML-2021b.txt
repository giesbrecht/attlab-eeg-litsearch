The objective of this study was to measure changes in trainees' cognitive and behavioral states as they progressed in a robotic surgeon training curriculum at a medical institution. Seven surgical trainees in urology who had no formal robotic training experience participated in the simulation curriculum. They performed 12 robotic skills exercises with varying levels of difficulty repetitively in separate sessions. EEG (electroencephalogram) activity and eye movements were measured throughout to calculate three metrics: engagement index (indicator of task engagement), pupil diameter (indicator of mental workload) and gaze entropy (indicator of randomness in gaze pattern). Performance scores (completion of task goals) and mental workload ratings (NASA-Task Load Index) were collected after each exercise. Changes in performance scores between training sessions were calculated. Analysis of variance, repeated measures correlation, and machine learning classification were used to diagnose how cognitive and behavioral states associate with performance increases or decreases between sessions. The changes in performance were correlated with changes in engagement index (r(rm) = - .25, p < .001) and gaze entropy (r(rm) = - .37, p < .001). Changes in cognitive and behavioral states were able to predict training outcomes with 72.5% accuracy. Findings suggest that cognitive and behavioral metrics correlate with changes in performance between sessions. These measures can complement current feedback tools used by medical educators and learners for skills assessment in robotic surgery training.

J	Das, K; Pachori, RB				Das, Kritiprasanna; Pachori, Ram Bilas			Schizophrenia detection technique using multivariate iterative filtering and multichannel EEG signals	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; EEG rhythm separation; Iterative filtering; Multivariate iterative filtering; Schizophrenia diagnosis	TIME; MORTALITY	A new approach for extension of univariate iterative filtering (IF) for decomposing a signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) or oscillatory modes is proposed for multivariate multi-component signals. Additionally the paper proposes a method to detect schizophrenia (Sz), based on analysing multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Using proposed multivariate iterative filtering (MIF), multi-channel EEG data are decomposed into multivariate IMFs (MIMFs). Depends on mean frequency, IMFs are grouped in order to separate EEG rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) from EEG signals. The features, such as Hjorth parameters are extracted from EEG rhythms. Extracted features are ranked using student t-test and most discriminant 30 features are used for classification. Different classifier such as K-nearest neighbours (K-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM) with diffident kernels are considered to classify Sz and healthy EEG patterns. The proposed method is employed to evaluate 19-channel EEG signals recorded from 14 paranoid Sz patients and 14 healthy subjects. We have achieved highest accuracy of 98.9% using the SVM (Cubic) classifier. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and area under ROC curve (AUC) of the same classifier are 99.0%, 98.8%, 98.4% and 0.999 respectively. Proposed approach for MIF is computationally efficient as compared to other multivariate signal decomposition algorithms. This paper presents a framework for decomposing multivariate signals efficiently and builds a model for detecting Sz accurately.

Increasing research has been conducted on decoding such neural activation patterns using representational semantic models. However, prior work decoding semantic meaning from neurophysiological responses has been largely limited to ECoG, fMRI, MEG, and EEG techniques, each having its own advantages and limitations. More recently, the functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as an alternative hemodynamic-based approach and possesses a number of strengths. We investigate brain decoding tasks under the help of fNIRS and empirically compare fNIRS with fMRI. Primarily, we find that: 1) like fMRI scans, activation patterns recorded from fNIRS encode rich information for discriminating concepts, but show limits on the possibility of decoding fine-grained semantic clues; 2) fNIRS decoding shows robustness across different brain regions, semantic categories and even subjects; 3) fNIRS has higher accuracy being decoded based on multi-channel patterns as compared to single-channel ones, which is in line with our intuition of the working mechanism of human brain. Our findings prove that fNIRS has the potential to promote a deep integration of NLP and cognitive neuroscience from the perspective of language understanding. We release the largest fNIRS dataset by far to facilitate future research.

Most TSC patients will also experience neurocognitive comorbidities. Our objective was to use machine learning techniques incorporating clinical and imaging data to predict the occurrence of major neurocognitive disorders and seizures in TSC patients. Methods A cohort of TSC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical data included genetic, demographic, and seizure characteristics. Imaging parameters included the number, characteristics, and location of cortical tubers and the presence of subependymal nodules, SEGAs, and cerebellar tubers. A random forest machine learning scheme was used to predict seizures and neurodevelopmental delay or intellectual developmental disability. Prediction ability was assessed by the area-under-the-curve of receiver-operating-characteristics (AUC-ROC) of ten-fold cross-validation training set and an independent validation set. Results The study population included 77 patients, 55% male (17.1 +/- 11.7 years old). The model achieved AUC-ROC of 0.72 +/- 0.1 and 0.68 in the training and internal validation datasets, respectively, for predicting neurocognitive comorbidity. Performance was limited in predicting seizures (AUC-ROC of 0.54 +/- 0.19 and 0.71 in the training and internal validation datasets, respectively). The integration of seizure characteristics into the model improved the prediction of neurocognitive comorbidity with AUC-ROC of 0.84 +/- 0.07 and 0.75 in the training and internal validation datasets, respectively. Conclusions This proof of concept study shows that it is possible to achieve a reasonable prediction of major neurocognitive morbidity in TSC patients using structural brain imaging and machine learning techniques. These tools can help clinicians identify subgroups of TSC patients with an increased risk of developing neurocognitive comorbidities.

J	Guerrero, MC; Parada, JS; Espitia, HE				Guerrero, Maria Camila; Parada, Juan Sebastian; Espitia, Helbert Eduardo			Principal Components Analysis of EEG Signals for Epileptic Patient Identification	COMPUTATION			English	Article						computational intelligence; classification; diseases diagnosis; principal component analysis	NETWORKS; ENTROPY	According to the behavior of its neuronal connections, it is possible to determine if the brain suffers from abnormalities such as epilepsy. This disease produces seizures and alters the patient's behavior and lifestyle. Neurologists employ the electroencephalogram (EEG) to diagnose the disease through brain signals. Neurologists visually analyze these signals, recognizing patterns, to identify some indication of brain disorder that allows for the epilepsy diagnosis. This article proposes a study, based on the Fourier analysis, through fast Fourier transformation and principal component analysis, to quantitatively identify patterns to diagnose and differentiate between healthy patients and those with the disease. Subsequently, principal component analysis can be used to classify patients, employing frequency bands as the signal features. Besides, it is made a classification comparison before and after using principal component analysis. The classification is performed via logistic regression, with a reduction from 5 to 4 dimensions, as well as from 8 to 7, achieving an improvement when there are 7 dimensions in the precision, recall, and F-1 score metrics. The best results obtained, without PCA are: precision 0.560, recall 0.690, and F-1 score 0.620; meanwhile, the best values obtained using PCA are: precision 0.734, recall 0.787, and F-1 score 0.776.

Long short-term memory units and convolutional neural networks are integrated within a multimodal sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. The trained neural network predicts fNIRS signals from EEG, sans a priori, by hierarchically extracting deep features from EEG full spectra and specific EEG frequency bands. Results show that higher frequency EEG ranges are predictive of fNIRS signals with the gamma band inputs dominating fNIRS prediction as compared to other frequency envelopes. Seed based functional connectivity validates similar patterns between experimental fNIRS and our model's fNIRS reconstructions. This is the first study that shows it is possible to predict brain hemodynamics (fNIRS) from encoded neural data (EEG) in the resting human epileptic brain based on power spectrum amplitude modulation of frequency oscillations in the context of specific hypotheses about how EEG frequency bands decode fNIRS signals.

Hardware Acceleration of EEG-Based Emotion Classification Systems: A Comprehensive Survey	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Emotion detection and classification; EEG; hardware acceleration; machine learning; monitoring of neurological disorders	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IMPAIRED RECOGNITION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; FEATURE-SELECTION; BRAIN RESPONSES; SCALP EEG; MUSIC; IMPLEMENTATION; DESIGN	Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in EEG-based wearable classifiers of emotions, which could enable the real-time monitoring of patients suffering from neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), or Alzheimer's. The hope is that such wearable emotion classifiers would facilitate the patients' social integration and lead to improved healthcare outcomes for them and their loved ones. Yet in spite of their direct relevance to neuro-medicine, the hardware platforms for emotion classification have yet to fill up some important gaps in their various approaches to emotion classification in a healthcare context. In this paper, we present the first hardware-focused critical review of EEG-based wearable classifiers of emotions and survey their implementation perspectives, their algorithmic foundations, and their feature extraction methodologies. We further provide a neuroscience-based analysis of current hardware accelerators of emotion classifiers and use it to map out several research opportunities, including multi-modal hardware platforms, accelerators with tightly-coupled cores operating robustly in the near/supra-threshold region, and pre-processing libraries for universal EEG-based datasets.

In order to assure active collaboration and trigger appropriate emotional input, accurate identification of human emotions is important. Poor generalization capacity induced by individual variations in emotion perceptions is indeed a concern in the current methods of emotion recognition. This work proposes a new dynamic pattern learning system based on entropy to allow electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for subject-independent emotion recognition with strong generalization and classification through Recurrent Neural Network and Ensemble learning. First, dynamic entropy measurements are used to derive consecutive entropy values over time from EEG signals in quantitative EEG calculations. Experiment findings indicate that in order to distinguish negative and positive emotions, the highest average accuracy of 94.67% is achieved. In addition, the findings have completely shown that this approach produces outstanding performance for emotion detection across individuals relative to recent studies.	[Ashokkumar, S.

One particular study is to use meditation research to reach out to the high-end applications of EEG data analysis in understanding human brain states and assisting in promoting human healthcare. The analysis of these states could be the initial step in a process to first predict and later allow individuals to control these states. To this end, the authors begin to build a system for dynamic brain state analysis using EEG data. The system allows users to transit EEG data to an online database through mobile devices, interact with the web server through web interface, and get feedback from EEG data analysis programs on real-time bases.

Multiple cortical brain regions are known to be responsible for sensory recognition, perception and motor execution during sensorimotor processing. While various research studies particularly focus on the domain of human sensorimotor control, the relation and processing between motor execution and sensory processing is not yet fully understood. Main goal of our work is to discriminate textured surfaces varying in their roughness levels during active tactile exploration using simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data, while minimizing the variance of distinct motor exploration movement patterns. We perform an experimental study with eight healthy participants who were instructed to use the tip of their dominant hand index finger while rubbing or tapping three different textured surfaces with varying levels of roughness. We use an adversarial invariant representation learning neural network architecture that performs EEG-based classification of different textured surfaces, while simultaneously minimizing the discriminability of motor movement conditions (i.e., rub or tap). Results show that the proposed approach can discriminate between three different textured surfaces with accuracies up to 70%, while suppressing movement related variability from learned representations.

We proposed a novel MI-based BCI paradigm based on the sixth-finger which imagines controlling the extra fingermovements. The goal of this work was to investigate the EEG characteristics and the application potential of MI-based BCI systems based on the new imagination paradigm (sixth-finger MI). 14 subjects participated in the experiment involving the sixth-finger MI tasks and rest state. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was adopted to analyze EEG spatial and time-frequency features. Common spatial patterns (CSP) were used for feature extraction and classification was implemented by support vector machine (SVM). ERD (event-related desynchronization) was found in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor area (M1) with a faint contralateral dominance. Unlike traditional human hand MI, ERD was also found in frontal lobe. The highest accuracy of 80% and mean accuracy of 70%. This work provided a novel paradigm for MI-based MI system, widened the control bandwidth of the BCI system. In addition, we discussed the application potential of the sixth-finger MI.

One of the main challenges in this regard is the varying patterns of EEG indifferent subjects. Domain adaptation is an effective method to reduce the data difference between the source domain and the target domain. However, it is an enormous challenge to make a discriminator-based domain adaptation with a small target data and transform the target domain to the source domain. In the present study, a novel method called "few-label adversarial domain adaption"(FLADA) is proposed for cross-subject emotion classification tasks with small EEG data. The proposed method involves three steps: (a) Selecting subjects of the close source domain forming an adapted list. Few labeled target data are tested based on each emotion model of the source subject to get the subject list of the source domain. (b)Training three models based on each selected subject and the target subject. Three loss functions and six groups' dataset are designed to get a domain adaption model for each selected source subject. (c) Distilling all classifiers for classifying the target emotion. In general, the main purpose of the proposed method, which originates from the Meta-learning, is to find a feature representation that is broadly suitable for the target subject and source subject with limited labels. The proposed method can be applied to all deep learning oriented models. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, extensive experiments are carried out on SEED and DEAP datasets, which are public datasets. It is found that with a small amount of target data, the proposed FLADA model outperforms the state-of-art methods in terms of accuracy and AUC-ROC.

Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia: A Robust Classification Method of EEG Signals and a Comparison of Validation Methods	DIAGNOSTICS			English	Article						electroencephalogram; EEG; dementia; Alzheimer's disease; frontotemporal dementia; classification; k-fold; leave-one-patient-out	QUANTITATIVE EEG; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; ABNORMALITIES; APHASIA	Dementia is the clinical syndrome characterized by progressive loss of cognitive and emotional abilities to a degree severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurogenerative disorder, making up 50-70% of total dementia cases. Another dementia type is frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is associated with circumscribed degeneration of the prefrontal and anterior temporal cortex and mainly affects personality and social skills. With the rapid advancement in electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, the EEG has become a suitable, accurate, and highly sensitive biomarker for the identification of neuronal and cognitive dynamics in most cases of dementia, such as AD and FTD, through EEG signal analysis and processing techniques. In this study, six supervised machine-learning techniques were compared on categorizing processed EEG signals of AD and FTD cases, to provide an insight for future methods on early dementia diagnosis. K-fold cross validation and leave-one-patient-out cross validation were also compared as validation methods to evaluate their performance for this classification problem. The proposed methodology accuracy scores were 78.5% for AD detection with decision trees and 86.3% for FTD detection with random forests.

Differentiating ictal and subclinical generalized spikes and waves discharges (GSWDs) in the EEG is challenging, since they appear to be identical upon visual inspection. Here, spectral and functional connectivity (FC) analyses were applied to routine EEG data of CAE patients, to differentiate ictal and subclinical GSWDs. Methods: Twelve CAE patients with both ictal and subclinical GSWDs were retrospectively selected for this study. The selected EEG epochs were subjected to frequency analysis in the range of 1-30 Hz. Further, FC analysis based on the imaginary part of coherency was used to determine sensor level networks. Results: Delta, alpha and beta band frequencies during ictal GSWDs showed significantly higher power compared to subclinical GSWDs. FC showed significant network differences for all frequency bands, demonstrating weaker connectivity between channels during ictal GSWDs. Conclusion: Using spectral and FC analyses significant differences between ictal and subclinical GSWDs in CAE patients were detected, suggesting that these features could be used for machine learning classification purposes to improve EEG monitoring. Significance: Identifying differences between ictal and subclinical GSWDs using routine EEG, may improve understanding of this syndrome and the management of patients with CAE.

However, little is known whether fragmented reading (FR) affects cognition and what are the underlying electroencephalogram (EEG) alterations it may lead to. Purpose: This study aimed to identify whether individuals have FR habits based on the single-trial EEG spectral features using machine learning (ML), as well as to find out the potential cognitive impairment induced by FR. Methods: Subjects were recruited through a questionnaire and divided into FR and noFR groups according to the time they spent on FR per day. Moreover, 64-channel EEG was acquired in Continuous Performance Task (CPT) and segmented into 0.5-1.5 s post-stimulus epochs under cue and background conditions. The sample sizes were as follows: FR in cue condition, 692 trials; noFR in cue condition, 688 trials; FR in background condition, 561 trials; noFR in background condition, 585 trials. For these single-trials, the relative power (RP) of six frequency bands [delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta1 (14-20 Hz), beta2 (21-29 Hz), lower gamma (30-40 Hz)] were extracted as features. After feature selection, the most important feature sets were fed into three ML models, namely Support-Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes to perform the identification of FR. RP of six frequency bands was also used as feature sets to conduct classification tasks. Results: The classification accuracy reached up to 96.52% in the SVM model under cue conditions. Specifically, among six frequency bands, the most important features were found in alpha and gamma bands. Gamma achieved the highest classification accuracy (86.69% for cue, 86.45% for background). In both conditions, alpha RP in central sites of FR was stronger than noFR (p < 0.001). Gamma RP in the frontal site of FR was weaker than noFR in the background condition (p < 0.001), while alpha RP in parieto-occipital sites of FR was stronger than noFR in the cue condition (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Fragmented reading can be identified based on single-trial EEG evoked by CPT using ML, and the RP of alpha and gamma may reflect the impairment on attention and working memory by FR. FR might lead to cognitive impairment and is worth further exploration.

BCI learning induces core-periphery reorganization in M/EEG multiplex brain networks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI training; MEG; EEG; multilayer networks; brain networks	GENDERED CITATION PATTERNS; MOTOR IMAGERY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MACHINE INTERFACES; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; MEG; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; PERFORMANCE	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) constitute a promising tool for communication and control. However, mastering non-invasive closed-loop systems remains a learned skill that is difficult to develop for a non-negligible proportion of users. The involved learning process induces neural changes associated with a brain network reorganization that remains poorly understood. Approach. To address this inter-subject variability, we adopted a multilayer approach to integrate brain network properties from electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic data resulting from a four-session BCI training program followed by a group of healthy subjects. Our method gives access to the contribution of each layer to multilayer network that tends to be equal with time. Main results. We show that regardless the chosen modality, a progressive increase in the integration of somatosensory areas in the alpha band was paralleled by a decrease of the integration of visual processing and working memory areas in the beta band. Notably, only brain network properties in multilayer network correlated with future BCI scores in the alpha(2) band: positively in somatosensory and decision-making related areas and negatively in associative areas. Significance. Our findings cast new light on neural processes underlying BCI training. Integrating multimodal brain network properties provides new information that correlates with behavioral performance and could be considered as a potential marker of BCI learning.

Yoga and meditation are the best strategies to reduce the effect of stress on physical and mental level without any side-effects. In this study, combined yoga and Sudarshan Kriya (SK) has been used as an alternative and complementary therapy for the management of stress. The aim of the study is to find a method to classify the meditator and non-meditator states with the best accuracy. The 50 subjects have been participating in this study and divided into two groups, i.e. study and control group. The subjects with regular practice of Yoga and SK are known as meditators and the ones without any practice of yoga and meditation were known as non-meditators. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were acquired from these both groups before and after 3 months. The statistical parameters were computed from these acquired EEG signals using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). These extracted statistical parameters were given as input to the classifiers. The decision tree, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Weighted K- Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and ensemble classifiers were used for classification of meditator and non- meditator states from the acquired EEG signals. The results have demonstrated that the SVM method gives the highest classification accuracy as compared to other classifiers. The proposed method can be used as a diagnosis system in clinical practices.

The success of these applications largely depends on the accuracy of the detection and classification techniques employed. Several methods have been investigated, proposed and developed over the years. This paper investigates various seizure detection algorithms and classifications in the last decade, including conventional techniques and recent deep learning algorithms. It also discusses epileptiform detection as one of the steps towards advanced diagnoses of disorders of consciousness (DOCs) and their understanding. A performance comparison was carried out on the different algorithms investigated, and their advantages and disadvantages were explored. From our survey, much attention has recently been paid to exploring the efficacy of deep learning algorithms in seizure detection and classification, which are employed in other areas such as image processing and classification. Hybrid deep learning has also been explored, with CNN-RNN being the most popular.

The ASR algorithm can, however, be constrained by the limited memory available on portable devices. To address this challenge, we propose a Hardware-Oriented Memory-Limited Online ASR (HMO-ASR) algorithm. The proposed HMO-ASR algorithm consists of (1) two-level window-based preprocessing including PCA-based and z-score-based preprocessing to clean the data in each window, (2) iterative mean, standard deviation, and covariance update using a parallel algorithm to achieve window-based processing, and (3) early eigenvector matrix determination to save the computation. With the three schemes, the HMO-ASR method can be implemented on mobile devices, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with limited memory. The study results showed that the proposed HMO-ASR algorithm can achieve comparable performance to those obtained by the offline ASR algorithm with a 98.64% reduction in memory size. An FPGA implementation is used for silicon proof of the proposed HMO-ASR algorithm.

However, predictive models identifying who is prone to develop AUD and the biomarkers indicating a predisposition to AUD are still unclear. Our sample (n = 656) included offspring and non-offspring of European American (EA) and African American (AA) ancestry from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) who were recruited as early as age 12 and were unaffected at first assessment and reassessed years later as AUD (DSM-5) (n = 328) or unaffected (n = 328). Machine learning analysis was performed for 220 EEG measures, 149 alcohol-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a recent large Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of alcohol use/misuse and two family history (mother DSM-5 AUD and father DSM-5 AUD) features using supervised, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to test which features assessed before developing AUD predict those who go on to develop AUD. Age, gender, and ancestry stratified analyses were performed. Results indicate significant and higher accuracy rates for the AA compared with the EA prediction models and a higher model accuracy trend among females compared with males for both ancestries. Combined EEG and SNP features model outperformed models based on only EEG features or only SNP features for both EA and AA samples. This multidimensional superiority was confirmed in a follow-up analysis in the AA age groups (12-15, 16-19, 20-30) and EA age group (16-19). In both ancestry samples, the youngest age group achieved higher accuracy score than the two other older age groups. Maternal AUD increased the model's accuracy in both ancestries' samples. Several discriminative EEG measures and SNPs features were identified, including lower posterior gamma, higher slow wave connectivity (delta, theta, alpha), higher frontal gamma ratio, higher beta correlation in the parietal area, and 5 SNPs: rs4780836, rs2605140, rs11690265, rs692854, and rs13380649. Results highlight the significance of sampling uniformity followed by stratified (e.g., ancestry, gender, developmental period) analysis, and wider selection of features, to generate better prediction scores allowing a more accurate estimation of AUD development.

However, brain signals are known to be non-stationary and existing systems are not reliable and robust enough to be taken outside of the laboratory. Often times long calibration and re-calibration of the system is required which can be tiresome and frustrating to the user. In this study, we compare the method of common spatial patterns (CSP) with two of its variants, namely, the canonical correlation analysis approach to common spatial patterns (CCACSP) and the common spatio-spectral patterns (CSSP) in detecting the motor imagery signal when trained on calibration data with sham feedback and tested in online control. We show that the motor imagery performance is significantly better with CSSP and CCACSP compared to CSP and hence, able to provide a more reliable transfer of the classifier from calibration to online control.

Among patients who are comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, identifying those with potential for awakening and favorable recovery is challenging. Currently, this task is accomplished through the acquisition of one or more diagnostic modalities that aim to assess brain function, with expert interpretation of the test results. This approach is subjective, imprecise, and not scalable. We propose an automatic ensemble classification framework, named SmartPrognosis, to identify comatose post-arrest patients with no recovery potential. SmartPrognosis automatically generates and assembles candidate machine learning pipelines with high sensitivity predicting poor outcomes at a fixed near-zero error rate of misclassifying patients with good outcomes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SmartPrognosis on real patient data, showing that it over-performs commonly used alternative approaches on all evaluation metrics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

These game elements include gestural and facial expressions of avatars during dialogues with the player, background music, the score, game mechanics, aesthetics and learning. The framework BARGAIN (Behavioral Affective Rule-based Games Adaptation Interface) is an authoring tool for affective game design providing a visual interface based on finite state machine (FSM) technique to represent the affective rules as state transitions graph dependent on the player emotional state assessed using facial expression recognition system based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted a user study (n = 29) examining the effects of the resulting affective virtual reality game on players' experience using the Game experience Questionnaire (GEQ) (IJsselsteijn et al. in The game experience questionnaire, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, 2013). The results show significant correlation between the GEQ dimensions and the player's facial expressions during his interaction with the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) within the VR game. These findings highlight that adapting games to user's emotions enhance the players' experience.

However, how to extract effective features is a core issue in a BCI system. Methods: We proposes the Multi-Feature Fusion Method based on Wavelength Optimal Spatial Filter and Mul-tiscale Entropy for classifying the electroencephalogram signals (EEG) in four kinds of motor imagery tasks. The method can combine Wavelength features with Multiscale Entropy. Results: Two groups of experiments were conducted. One for simple four types of motor imagery (MI) tasks and another for unilateral limb. Experiments show that our proposed method has better performance compared to other methods. (82.55% versus 73.08% average accuracy respectively). Conclusions: The proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of EEG classification in multiclass motor imagery and will be useful for neurorehabilitation through motor imagery for hemiplegic patients.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are spontaneous and difficult to camouflage, so they are used for emotion recognition in academic and industrial circles. In order to overcome the disadvantage that traditional machine learning based emotion recognition technology relies too much on a manual feature extraction, we propose an EEG emotion recognition algorithm based on 3D feature fusion and convolutional autoencoder (CAE). First, the differential entropy (DE) features of different frequency bands of EEG signals are fused to construct the 3D features of EEG signals, which retain the spatial information between channels. Then, the constructed 3D features are input into the CAE constructed in this paper for emotion recognition. In this paper, many experiments are carried out on the open DEAP dataset, and the recognition accuracy of valence and arousal dimensions are 89.49 and 90.76%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for emotion recognition tasks.</p>	[An, Yanling; Hu, Shaohai] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Inst Informat Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Duan, Xiaoying] Northwest Univ, Sch Econom & Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Ling] Hebei Univ, Coll Qual & Syst Supervis, Baoding, Peoples R China; [Xie, Caiyun; Zhao, Yingying] Hebei Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Baoding, Peoples R China; [Xie, Caiyun; Zhao, Yingying] Machine Vis Technol Creat Ctr Hebei Prov, Baoding, Peoples R China		Hu, SH (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Inst Informat Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Zhao, L (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Coll Qual & Syst Supervis, Baoding, Peoples R China.	shhu@bjtu.eud.cn; lingzhao_hbu@163.com			Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2021YJS041]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62172030, 62172139]	Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	Funding This work was financially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2021YJS041).

For this research, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model for predicting personality is used. There are four groups in MBTI, and each group consists of two traits versus each other; i.e., out of these two traits, every individual will have one personality trait in them. We have collected EEG data using a single NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 dry electrode unit. For data collection, 40 Hindi and English video clips were included in a standard database. All clips provoke various emotions, and data collection is focused on these emotions, as the clips include targeted, inductive scenes of personality. Fifty participants engaged in this research and willingly agreed to provide brain signals. We compared the performance of our deep learning DeepLSTM model with other state-of-the-art-based machine learning classifiers such as artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), LibSVM, and hybrid genetic programming (HGP). The analysis shows that, for the 10-fold partitioning method, the DeepLSTM model surpasses the other state-of-the-art models and offers a maximum classification accuracy of 96.94%. The proposed DeepLSTM model was also applied to the publicly available ASCERTAIN EEG dataset and showed an improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.

In this model, the EEG signal is preprocessed first, and then the PCA method is used to reduce the dimensionality of the collected brain channels to obtain a set of optimal channel subsets that have a good response to the P300 signal. On this basis, the semi-supervised classification model based on SVM is designed, and improves on the traditional discriminant analysis method, through a Euclidean distance between tag data and no labels to obtain the relationship of them, and, in turn, to optimize the objective function, to solve the projection vector, feature extraction, and then vote classification approach to the final recognition. Finally, experimental verification is carried out. The results show that the method can obtain 84.3% of the correct classification results under 40% of the label data. It has a good application prospect in the context of only a small amount of label data and reduces the time complexity. It has greater application value for online systems.

Previous studies in humans have measured putative memory representations indirectly, by decoding memory contents from neural activity evoked by a neutral impulse stimulus. However, it is unclear whether memory contents can also be decoded in different species and attentional conditions. Here, we employ a cross-species approach to test whether auditory memory contents can be decoded from electrophysiological signals recorded in different species. Awake human volunteers (N = 21) were exposed to auditory pure tone and noise burst stimuli during an auditory sensory memory task using electroencephalography. In a closely matching paradigm, anesthetized female rats (N = 5) were exposed to comparable stimuli while neural activity was recorded using electrocorticography from the auditory cortex. In both species, the acoustic frequency could be decoded from neural activity evoked by pure tones as well as neutral frozen noise burst stimuli. This finding demonstrates that memory contents can be decoded in different species and different states using homologous methods, suggesting that the mechanisms of sensory memory encoding are evolutionarily conserved across species.

Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to address this challenge with emphasis to medical applications. However, each one of the existing FS algorithms come with its own advantages and disadvantages introducing a certain level of bias. Materials and Methods: To avoid bias and alleviate the defectiveness of single feature selection results, an ensemble FS methodology is proposed in this paper that aggregates the results of several FS algorithms (filter, wrapper and embedded ones). Fuzzy logic is employed to combine multiple feature importance scores thus leading to a more robust selection of informative features. The proposed fuzzy ensemble FS methodology was applied on the problem of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction with special emphasis on the progression of joint space narrowing (JSN). The proposed FS methodology was integrated into an end-to-end machine learning pipeline and a thorough experimental evaluation was conducted using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database. Several classifiers were investigated for their suitability in the task of JSN prediction and the best performing model was then post-hoc analyzed by using the SHAP method. Results: The results showed that the proposed method presented a better and more stable performance in contrast to other competitive feature selection methods, leading to an average accuracy of 78.14% using XG Boost at 31 selected features. The post-hoc explainability highlighted the important features that contribute to the classification of patients with JSN progression. Conclusions: The proposed fuzzy feature selection approach improves the performance of the predictive models by selecting a small optimal subset of features compared to popular feature selection methods.

Previous studies on this topic have used a variety of machine learning algorithms and inputs such as audial, visual, or physiological signals. Recently, a lot of interest has been focused on the last, as speech or video recording is impractical for some applications. Therefore, there is a need to create Human-Computer Interface Systems capable of recognizing emotional states from noninvasive and nonintrusive physiological signals. Typically, the recognition task is carried out from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, obtaining good accuracy. However, EEGs are difficult to register without interfering with daily activities, and recent studies have shown that it is possible to use electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for this purpose. This work improves the performance of emotion recognition from ECG signals using wavelet transform for signal analysis. Features of the ECG signal are extracted from the AMIGOS database using a wavelet scattering algorithm that allows obtaining features of the signal at different time scales, which are then used as inputs for different classifiers to evaluate their performance. The results show that the proposed algorithm for extracting features and classifying the signals obtains an accuracy of 88.8% in the valence dimension, 90.2% in arousal, and 95.3% in a two-dimensional classification, which is better than the performance reported in previous studies. This algorithm is expected to be useful for classifying emotions using wearable devices.

Nonetheless, this procedure is not adequate to characterize the inter-individual variability present in major neuropsychological syndromes. We tested the possibility of getting a reliable individual EEG characterization of deficits of endogenous orienting of spatial attention in right-brain damaged (RBD) patients with left spatial neglect (N+). We used a single-trial topographical analysis (STTA; [39] of individual scalp EEG topographies recorded during leftward and rightward orienting of attention with central cues in RBD patients with and without (N) neglect and in healthy controls (HC). We found that the STTA successfully decoded EEG signals related to leftward and rightward orienting in five out of the six N+, five out of the six N patients and in all the six HC. In agreement with findings from conventional average-group studies, successful classifications of EEG signals in N+ were observed during the 400-800 ms period post-cue-onset, which reflects preserved voluntary engagement of attention resources (ADAN component). These results suggest the possibility of acquiring reliable individual EEG profiles of neglect patients.

However, the sensitivity to noise/artifact and the non-stationarity of EEG signals result in high inter-subject/session variability. Therefore, each subject usually spends long and tedious calibration time in building a subject-specific classifier. To solve this problem, we review existing signal processing approaches, including transfer learning (TL), semi-supervised learning (SSL), and a combination of TL and SSL. Cross-subject TL can transfer amounts of labeled samples from different source subjects for the target subject. Moreover, Cross-session/task/device TL can reduce the calibration time of the subject for the target session, task, or device by importing the labeled samples from the source sessions, tasks, or devices. SSL simultaneously utilizes the labeled and unlabeled samples from the target subject. The combination of TL and SSL can take advantage of each other. For each kind of signal processing approaches, we introduce their concepts and representative methods. The experimental results show that TL, SSL, and their combination can obtain good classification performance by effectively utilizing the samples available. In the end, we draw a conclusion and point to research directions in the future.

These complex biopotential oscillations are called electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Certain diseases, such as epilepsy, can be detected by measuring these signals. Epilepsy is a disease that manifests itself as seizures. These seizures manifest themselves in different characteristics. These different characteristics divide epilepsy seizure types into two main groups: generalized and partial epilepsy. This study aimed to classify different types of epilepsy from EEG signals. For this purpose, a scalogram-based, deep learning approach has been developed. The utilized classification process had the following main steps: the scalogram images were obtained by using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method. So, a one-dimension EEG time series was converted to a two-dimensional time-frequency data set in order to extract more features. Then, the increased dimension data set (CWT scalogram images) was applied to the convolutional neural network (CNN) as input patterns for classifying the images. The EEG signals were taken from Dicle University, Neurology Clinic of Medical School. This data consisted of four classes: healthy brain waves, generalized preseizure, generalized seizure, and partial epilepsy brain waves. With the proposed method, the average accuracy performance of three of the EEG records' classes (healthy, generalized preseizure, and generalized seizure), and that of all four classes of EEG records were 90.16 % (+/- 0.20) and 84.66 % (+/- 0.48). According to these results, regarding the specific accuracy ratings of the recordings, the healthy EEG records scored 91.29 %, generalized epileptic seizure records were at 96.50 %, partial seizure EEG records scored 89.63 %, and the preseizure EEG records had a 90.44 % rating. The results of the proposed method were compared to the results of both similar studies and conventional methods. As a result, the performance of the proposed method was found to be acceptable.

However, the formulation of the conventional CSP based on the L2-norm is sensitive to outliers. Whereas the L1-norm-based common spatial pattern (CSP-L1) proposed in recent years can seek robust spatial filters to effectively alleviate the impact of outliers, the L1-norm is unable to characterize the geometric structure of the data well. To further improve the robustness of CSP, in this paper, we propose a new extension to CSP called the L21-norm-based common spatial pattern (CSP-L21), which is formulated by using the L21-norm rather than the L2-norm. Moreover, CSP-L21 has the advantages of rotational invariance and geometric structure characterization. We provide a non-greedy iterative algorithm to maximize the objective function of CSP-L21. Experiments on a toy example and three popular data sets of BCI competitions illustrate that the proposed method can efficiently extract discriminative features.

It is one of the most important diagnostic methods in sleep research and must be carried out with a high degree of accuracy because any errors in the scoring in the patient's sleep EEG recordings can cause serious problems. The aim of this research is to develop a new automatic method for detecting the most important characteristics in sleep stage 2 such as k-complexes based on multi-domain features. In this study, each EEG signal is divided into a set of segments using a sliding window technique. Based on extensive experiments during the training phase, the size of the sliding window is set to 0.5 s (s). Then a set of statistical, fractal, frequency and non-linear features are extracted from each epoch based on the time domain, Katz's algorithm, power spectrum density (PSD) and tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). As a result, a vector of twenty-two features is obtained to represent each EEG segment. In order to detect k-complexes, the extracted features were analysed for their ability to detect the k-complex waveforms. Based on the analysis of the features, twelve out of twenty-two features are selected and forwarded to a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier to identify k-complexes in EEG signals. A set of various classification techniques of K-means and extreme learning machine classifiers are used to compare the obtained results and to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.The experimental results showed that the proposed method, based on multi-domain features, achieved better recognition results than other methods and classifiers. An average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 97.7 %, 97 %, and 94.2 % were obtained, respectively, with the CZ-A1 channel according to the R&K standard. The experimental results with high classification performance demonstrated that the technique can help doctors optimize the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.

Therefore there is a need for objective measures of speech intelligibility. Recently, it has been shown that speech intelligibility can be measured by letting a person listen to natural speech, recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) and decoding the speech envelope from the EEG signal. Linear decoders are used, which is sub-optimal, as the human brain is a complex non-linear system and cannot easily be modeled by a linear decoder. We therefore propose an approach based on deep learning which can model complex non-linear relationships. Our approach is based on dilated convolutions as used in WaveNet to maximize the receptive field with regard to the number of tunable parameters. Comparison with a model based on a state of the art linear decoder and a convolutional baseline model shows that our proposed model significantly improves on both models (from 62.3% to 90.6% (p <0.001) and from 78.8% to 90.6% (p <0.001) respectively). Best results are achieved with a receptive field size between 250-500ms, which is longer than the optimal integration window for a linear decoder.

Thus, in the current study, we investigated the neural processing of ignored speech in a two-competing-speaker paradigm. For this, we recorded the participant's brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) to track the neural representation of the attended and ignored speech envelope. To provoke distraction, we occasionally embedded the participant's first name in the ignored speech stream. Retrospective reports as well as the presence of a P3 component in response to the name indicate that participants noticed the occurrence of their name. As predicted, the neural representation of the ignored speech envelope increased after the name was presented therein, suggesting that the name had attracted the participant's attention. Interestingly, in contrast to our hypothesis, the neural tracking of the attended speech envelope also increased after the name occurrence. On this account, we conclude that the name might not have primarily distracted the participants, at most for a brief duration, but that it alerted them to focus to their actual task. These observations remained robust even when the sound intensity of the ignored speech stream, and thus the sound intensity of the name, was attenuated.

Methods: Retrospective study of adult (>18 years) cardiac arrest patients who underwent multimodal monitoring; UO was defined as cerebral performance category 3-5 at 3 months. Predictors of UO were neurological pupillary index (NPi) <= 2 at 24 h; highly malignant patterns on EEG (HMp) within 48 h; bilateral absence of N20 waves on somato-sensory evoked potentials; and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) > 75 mu g/L. Time-dependent decisional tree (i.e., NPi on day 1; HMp on day 1-2; absent N20 on day 2-3; highest NSE) and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis were used to assess the prediction of UO. Results: Of 137 patients, 104 (73%) had UO. Abnormal NPi, HMp on day 1 or 2, the bilateral absence of N20 or NSE >75 mcg/L had a specificity of 100% to predict UO. The presence of abnormal NPi was highly concordant with HMp and high NSE, and absence of N20 or high NSE with HMp. However, HMp had weak to moderate concordance with other predictors. The time-dependent decisional tree approach identified 73/103 patients (70%) with UO, showing a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 100%. Using the CART approach, HMp on EEG was the only variable significantly associated with UO. Conclusions: This study suggests that patients with UO had often at least two predictors of UO, except for HMp. A multimodal time-dependent approach may be helpful in the prediction of UO after CA. EEG should be included in all multimodal prognostic models.

Rajendra			SPWVD-CNN for Automated Detection of Schizophrenia Patients Using EEG Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); electroencephalogram (EEG) signals; scalogram; schizophrenia (SZ) detection; spectrogram; time-frequency representation (TFR)	CLASSIFICATION; COMPLEXITY; FEATURES	Schizophrenia (SZ) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunctions, hallucinations, and delusions, which may lead to lifetime disability. Detection and diagnosis of SZ by visual inspection is subjective, difficult, and timeconsuming. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used to detect the SZ as they reflect the conditions of the brain. Conventional machine learning methods involve many lengthy manual steps, such as decomposition, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In this article, automated identification of SZ is proposed using a combination of time-frequency analysis and convolutional neural network (CNN) to overcome the limitations of feature extraction-based methods. Three press button tasks are analyzed to segregate normal subjects and SZ patients. The EEG signals are subjected to continuous wavelet transform, short-time Fourier transform, and smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) techniques to obtain scalogram, spectrogram, and SPWVD-based time-frequency representation (TFR) plots, respectively. These 2-D plots are fed to pretrained AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and CNN. We have obtained an accuracy of 93.36% using the SPWVD-based TFR and CNN model. In comparison to the benchmark AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 networks, the developed CNN model with four convolutional layers not only requires fewer learnable parameters but also is computationally efficient and fast. This clearly indicates that our proposed method combining the SPWVD-CNN model has performed better than the state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques. Our developed model is ready to be tested with more EEG data and can aid psychiatrists in their diagnosis.

In many classification scenarios, the data can be naturally represented by symmetric positive definite matrices, which are inherently points that live on a curved Riemannian manifold. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of Riemannian manifolds, traditional Euclidean machine learning algorithms yield poor results on such data. In this paper, we generalize the probabilistic learning vector quantization algorithm for data points living on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices equipped with Riemannian natural metric (affine-invariant metric). By exploiting the induced Riemannian distance, we derive the probabilistic learning Riemannian space quantization algorithm, obtaining the learning rule through Riemannian gradient descent. Empirical investigations on synthetic data, image data , and motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

There are several different signals that can be used for the interface. Among them, one finds the P300 signal. The P300 signal is a potential signal that is passively produced when a user observes, hears or pays attention to a desired stimulus. This signal has been used in conjunction with a graphical user interface (GUI) to allow a person to choose commands from a list of possible actions. Traditionally, the visual stimuli are repeated and averaged to increase classification accuracy, which, in turn, reduces the maximum possible command rate. In order to improve command rate, this paper describes a system wherein feature extraction and classifier training could be tested offline. Then, live testing in a mobile robot steering simulation was carried out. Finally, a live experiment is reported. The features to be used in classification are selected using a genetic algorithm (GA). Using the chosen features, 78.3% signal detection accuracy was achieved for single epochs. Using multiple-epochs to improve classifier performance in simulated and real-world steering experiments we were able to successfully navigate a simple maze while maintaining classifier accuracy (Sim: 79.9 +/- 5.3%, Real: 88.8 +/- 10.1%).

Though the accuracy of Motor Imagery (MI) BCI systems based on the deep learning have been greatly improved compared with some traditional algorithms, it is still a big problem to clearly interpret the deep learning models. To address the issues, this work first introduces a popular deep learning model EEGNet and compares it with the traditional algorithm Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP). After that, this work considers that the 1-D convolution of EEGNet can be explained by a special Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and the depthwise convolution of EEGNet is similar to the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm. Therefore, this work improves the EEGNet by using the algorithm Temporary Constrained Sparse Group Lasso (TCSGL) to enhance its performance. The proposed model TSGL-EEGNet is tested on the BCI Competition IV 2a and BCI Competition III IIIa datasets that both are 4-classes classification MI tasks. The testing results show that the proposed model has achieved 78.96% (0.7194) average classification accuracy (kappa) on the dataset BCI Competition IV 2a, which are greater than EEGNet, C2CM, MB3DCNN, SS-MEMDBF and FBCSP, especially on insensitive subjects. The proposed model has also achieved 85.30% (0.8040) average classification accuracy (kappa) on the dataset BCI Competition III IIIa, which are greater than the EEGNet, MFTFS et al. At last, this work uses average-validation and stacking to further enhance the effect of the model. The 4-classes classification average accuracy rates reach 81.34% and 88.89%, and the kappas reach 0.7511 and 0.8519 on dataset BCI Competition IV 2a and BCI Competition III IIIa, respectively. Additionally, this work also uses the Grad-CAM to visualize the frequency and spatial features that are learned by the neural network.

Over the last decade, Riemannian geometry has shown promising results for motor imagery classification. However, extracting the underlying spatial features is not as straightforward as for applying common spatial pattern (CSP) filtering prior to classification. In this article, we propose a simple way to extract the spatial patterns obtained from Riemannian classification: the Riemannian spatial pattern (RSP) method, which is based on the backward channel selection procedure. Approach. The RSP method was compared to the CSP approach on ECoG data obtained from a quadriplegic patient while performing imagined movements of arm articulations and fingers. Main results. Similar results were found between the RSP and CSP methods for mapping each motor imagery task with activations following the classical somatotopic organization. Clustering obtained by pairwise comparisons of imagined motor movements however, revealed higher differentiation for the RSP method compared to the CSP approach. Importantly, the RSP approach could provide a precise comparison of the imagined finger flexions which added supplementary information to the mapping results. Significance. Our new RSP method illustrates the interest of the Riemannian framework in the spatial domain and as such offers new avenues for the neuroimaging community. This study is part of an ongoing clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02550522.

We then shift our focus to the periphery using tremor and Tourette's syndrome to illustrate the utility of peripheral biomarkers and interventions.

Due to the rareness and the pathophysiology of the disease, there is no test to confirm the diagnosis of task-specific dystonia, except comprehensive observations by the experts. Evidence from neural electrophysiological data suggests that enhanced low frequency (4-12 Hz) oscillations in the subcortical structure of the globus pallidus were associated with the pathological abnormalities concerning 13 and gamma rhythms in motor areas and motor cortical network in patients with task-specific dystonia. However, whether patients with task-specific dystonia have any low-frequency abnormalities in motor cortical areas remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that low-frequency abnormalities are present in core motor areas and motor cortical networks in patients with task-specific dystonia during performing the non-symptomatic movements and those low-frequency abnormalities can help the diagnosis of this disease. We tested this hypothesis by using EEG, effective connectivity analysis, and a machine learning method. Fifteen patients with task-specific dystonia and 15 healthy controls were recruited. The machine learning method identified 8 aberrant movement-related network connections concerning low frequency, 13 and gamma frequencies, which enabled the separation of the data of patients from those of controls with an accuracy of 90%. Importantly, 7 of the 8 aberrant connections engaged the premotor area contralateral to the affected hand, suggesting an important role of the premotor area in the pathological abnormities. The patients exhibited significantly lower low frequency activities during the movement preparation and significantly lower 13 rhythms during movements compared with healthy controls in the core motor areas. Our findings of low frequency- and 13-related abnormalities at the cortical level and aberrant motor network could help diagnose task-specific dystonia in the clinical setting, and the importance of the contralesional premotor area suggests its diagnostic potential for task-specific dystonia.

Cloud is being a popular platform for storing a large volume of biosignals such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and photoplethysmogram (PPG). However, outsourcing biosignals to the cloud may introduce authenticity issues. For instance, patient data can be altered, or fake patient data can be inserted by the dishonest cloud service provider or attacker for giving benefits to business organizations such as insurance service providers. Steganography approaches can be used to hide data sources identification data before outsourcing to the cloud for maintaining authenticity. Existing biosignal steganography approaches fail to reconstruct original biosignal after applying a reverse data hiding technique. In other words, current biosignal steganography approaches are irreversible. Reversible biosignal steganography method is required for protecting biosignal data from deterioration and efficient use by its stakeholders. In this work, we develop a reversible biosignal steganography approach using the Extended Binary Golay Code based error correction method. Our proposed method embeds secret authentication message as an error within different types of biosignals such as ECG, PPG, and EEG. Extended Binary Golay Code based error correction method is used to extract the secret message, and reconstruct original biosignal. We conduct a set of experiments for evaluating the performance of our proposed method.

J	Mezzina, G; Annese, VF; De Venuto, D				Mezzina, Giovanni; Annese, Valerio F.; De Venuto, Daniela			A Cybersecure P300-Based Brain-to-Computer Interface against Noise-Based and Fake P300 Cyberattacks	SENSORS			English	Article						P300; brain-to-computer interface; BCI; EEG; machine learning; classification; cybersecurity; hacking; brainjacking	BCI	In a progressively interconnected world where the Internet of Things (IoT), ubiquitous computing, and artificial intelligence are leading to groundbreaking technology, cybersecurity remains an underdeveloped aspect. This is particularly alarming for brain-to-computer interfaces (BCIs), where hackers can threaten the user's physical and psychological safety. In fact, standard algorithms currently employed in BCI systems are inadequate to deal with cyberattacks. In this paper, we propose a solution to improve the cybersecurity of BCI systems. As a case study, we focus on P300-based BCI systems using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms and EEG data. First, we verified that SVM algorithms are incapable of identifying hacking by simulating a set of cyberattacks using fake P300 signals and noise-based attacks. This was achieved by comparing the performance of several models when validated using real and hacked P300 datasets. Then, we implemented our solution to improve the cybersecurity of the system. The proposed solution is based on an EEG channel mixing approach to identify anomalies in the transmission channel due to hacking. Our study demonstrates that the proposed architecture can successfully identify 99.996% of simulated cyberattacks, implementing a dedicated counteraction that preserves most of BCI functions.

One of the critical operations used in CSP is taking the average of trial covariance matrices for each class. In this regard, the arithmetic mean, which minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances to the data points, is conventionally used; however, this operation ignores the Riemannian geometry in the manifold of covariance matrices. To alleviate this problem, Frechet mean determined using different Riemannian distances have been used. In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the following question: Does using the Frechet mean with Riemannian distances instead of arithmetic mean in averaging CSP covariance matrices improve the subject-independent classification of motor imagery (MI)? To answer this question we conduct a comparative study using the largest MI dataset to date, with 54 subjects and a total of 21,600 trials of left-and right-hand MI. The results indicate a general trend of having a statistically significant better performance when the Riemannian geometry is used.

The advantage of MI-BCI is that the recognition of brain ideas does not depend on task prompts, but it is difficult to accurately recognize the unilateral limb motor imagery tasks because of the difficulty of EEG decoding algorithm. In this paper, the asynchronous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG motor imagery data of unilateral limb hand grasping and hand handling tasks are creatively collected, and the brain activation features of each task are obtained by fMRI statistical analysis. The activation difference of the fMRI cerebral cortex is mapped to the corresponding channel position of the corresponding EEG and compared with the average power spectrum density (PSD) of each channel of each EEG trail. According to the comparison results, the more consistent EEG data are selected for training. The experimental results show that the screened EEG data training model shows a predict accuracy of 69.3%, which is a better classification result. The results proved that screening high-quality EEG by fMRI data has a certain effect, and the model is more consistent with the characteristics of brain motor imagery. This method can improve the prediction accuracy and guide the subjects to imagine correctly.

J	Almarri, B; Rajasekaran, S; Huang, CH				Almarri, Badar; Rajasekaran, Sanguthevar; Huang, Chun-Hsi			Automatic subject-specific spatiotemporal feature selection for subject-independent affective BCI	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EMOTION RECOGNITION; EEG	The dimensionality of the spatially distributed channels and the temporal resolution of electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) undermine emotion recognition models. Thus, prior to modeling such data, as the final stage of the learning pipeline, adequate preprocessing, transforming, and extracting temporal (i.e., time-series signals) and spatial (i.e., electrode channels) features are essential phases to recognize underlying human emotions. Conventionally, inter-subject variations are dealt with by avoiding the sources of variation (e.g., outliers) or turning the problem into a subject-deponent. We address this issue by preserving and learning from individual particularities in response to affective stimuli. This paper investigates and proposes a subject-independent emotion recognition framework that mitigates the subject-to-subject variability in such systems. Using an unsupervised feature selection algorithm, we reduce the feature space that is extracted from time-series signals. For the spatial features, we propose a subject-specific unsupervised learning algorithm that learns from inter-channel co-activation online. We tested this framework on real EEG benchmarks, namely DEAP, MAHNOB-HCI, and DREAMER. We train and test the selection outcomes using nested cross-validation and a support vector machine (SVM). We compared our results with the state-of-the-art subject-independent algorithms. Our results show an enhanced performance by accurately classifying human affection (i.e., based on valence and arousal) by 16%-27% compared to other studies. This work not only outperforms other subject-independent studies reported in the literature but also proposes an online analysis solution to affection recognition.

J	Ross, K; Hungler, P; Etemad, A				Ross, Kyle; Hungler, Paul; Etemad, Ali			Unsupervised multi-modal representation learning for affective computing with multi-corpus wearable data	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article; Early Access						Affective computing; Autoencoder; Arousal classification; Biosignals; Wearables	EMOTION RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; AROUSAL; FEATURES; EEG; STRESS; DOMAIN; MODEL; STYLE	There has been a growing focus on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for affective computing to further enhance user experience through emotion recognition. Typically, machine learning models used for affective computing are trained using manually extracted features from biological signals. Such features may not generalize well for large datasets. One approach to address this issue is to use fully supervised deep learning methods to learn latent representations. However, this method requires human supervision to label the data, which may be unavailable. In this work we propose an unsupervised framework for representation learning. The proposed framework utilizes two stacked convolutional autoencoders to learn latent representations from wearable electrocardiogram and electrodermal activity signals. The representations learned from this unsupervised framework are subsequently utilized within a random forest model to classify arousal. To validate this framework, an aggregation of the AMIGOS, ASCERTAIN, CLEAS, and MAHNOB-HCI datasets is created. The results of our proposed method are compared with other methods including convolutional neural networks, as well as methods that employ manual extraction of features. We show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art results. The results show the wide-spread applicability for stacked convolutional autoencoders to be used for affective computing.

Machine learning algorithms to predict seizure due to acute tramadol poisoning	HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Machine learning; prediction; seizure; tramadol	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RISK; CLASSIFICATION; ABILITY; USERS; EEG	Introduction: This study was designed to develop and evaluate machine learning algorithms for predicting seizure due to acute tramadol poisoning, identifying high-risk patients and facilitating appropriate clinical decision-making. Methods: Several characteristics of acute tramadol poisoning cases were collected in the Emergency Department (ED) (2013-2019). After selecting important variables in random forest method, prediction models were developed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithms. Area Under the Curve (AUC) and other diagnostic criteria were used to assess performance of models. Results: In 909 patients, 544 (59.8%) experienced seizures. The important predictors of seizure were sex, pulse rate, arterial blood oxygen pressure, blood bicarbonate level and pH. SVM (AUC = 0.68), NB (AUC = 0.71) and ANN (AUC = 0.70) models outperformed k-NN model (AUC = 0.58). NB model had a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value and k-NN model had higher specificity and positive predictive values than other models. Conclusion: A perfect prediction model may help improve clinicians' decision-making and clinical care at EDs in hospitals and medical settings. SVM, ANN and NB models had no significant differences in the performance and accuracy; however, validated logistic regression (LR) was the superior model for predicting seizure due to acute tramadol poisoning.

Three pieces of music were selected according to the difference in the fractal exponent and sample entropy of embedded noises in them. We calculated the fractal dimension and sample entropy of EEG and GSR signals for 11 subjects in rest and response to these music pieces. The correlation coefficients of 0.9525 and 0.9822 in the case of fractal dimension and sample entropy demonstrated a strong correlation between the complexities of the GSR and EEG signals. Therefore, we can state that the skin and brain responses are coupled. This method can be applied to evaluate the relationship between the human brain and other organs.

Recognizing emotion from Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been globally accepted in many applications such as intelligent thinking, decision-making, social communication, feeling detection, affective computing, etc. Nevertheless, due to having too low amplitude variation related to time on EEG signal, the proper recognition of emotion from this signal has become too challenging. Usually, considerable effort is required to identify the proper feature or feature set for an effective feature-based emotion recognition system. To extenuate the manual human effort of feature extraction, we proposed a deep machine-learning-based model with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). At first, the one-dimensional EEG data were converted to Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) featured images of channel correlation of EEG sub-bands. Then the images were fed into the CNN model to recognize emotion. Two protocols were conducted, namely, protocol-1 to identify two levels and protocol-2 to recognize three levels of valence and arousal that demonstrate emotion. We investigated that only the upper triangular portion of the PCC featured images reduced the computational complexity and size of memory without hampering the model accuracy. The maximum accuracy of 78.22% on valence and 74.92% on arousal were obtained using the internationally authorized DEAP dataset.

In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for subject-independent drowsiness recognition from single-channel EEG signals. Different from existing deep learning models that are mostly treated as black-box classifiers, the proposed model can "explain" its decisions for each input sample by revealing which parts of the sample contain important features identified by the model for classification. This is achieved by a visualization technique by taking advantage of the hidden states output by the LSTM layer. Results show that the model achieves an average accuracy of 72.97% on 11 subjects for leave-one-out subject-independent drowsiness recognition on a public dataset, which is higher than the conventional baseline methods of 55.42%-69.27%, and state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Visualization results show that the model has discovered meaningful patterns of EEG signals related to different mental states across different subjects.

Epilepsy can attack someone when there is damage or changes in the brain. This study researchers tried to use sampling techniques as a feature of extracting epilepsy signal features and the K-NN method to identify epilepsy signal patterns. The data of this study took epilepsy signal data from the University of Bonn's Epileptologie clinic which consisted of data set A, open eye normal signal, set B normal closed eye signal, set C in epilepsy zone, set D enter epilepsy, set E seizure epilepsy. In this study, researchers tried to classify data set A, data for normal people and data set E, data for people who have epilepsy. Data set A consists of 100 EEG signals and data set E consists of 100 EEG signal data. The data used are data for the training process as much as 50 Epilepsy signal data and data for the trial process as many as 50 Epilepsy signal data. In the trial process the classification results reach 100% accuracy. The trial process uses the value of K = 1 to the value of K = 9.

This is particularly important in the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), where feed forward systems gather data from imagined brain activity and then send that information to an effector. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a computational approach that enables an accurate mapping of spatial brain activity (fMRI) in relation to the temporal receptors (EEG electrodes) associated with imagined lower limb movement. New method: EEG and fMRI data from 16 healthy, male participants while imagining lower limb movement were used for this purpose. A combined analysis of fMRI data and EEG electrode locations was developed to identify EEG electrodes with a high likelihood of capturing imagined lower limb movement originating from various clusters of brain activity. This novel feature selection tool was used to develop an artificial neural network model to classify right and left lower limb movement. Results: Results showed that left versus right lower limb imagined movement could be classified with 66.5% accuracy using this approach. Comparison with existing methods: Adopting a purely data-driven approach for feature selection to use in the right/left classification task resulted in the same accuracy (66.6%) but with reduced interpretability. Conclusions: The developed fMRI-informed EEG approach could pave the way towards improved brain computer interfaces for lower limb movement while also being applicable to other systems where fMRI could be helpful to inform EEG acquisition and processing.

Quantitative [(18)]FDG PET asymmetry features predict long-term seizure recurrence in refractory epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						3D-SSP; Asymmetry; PET; Drug-resistant epilepsy; Surgical outcome; Imaging features; Machine learning; Open source	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; FDG-PET; EXTRATEMPORAL HYPOMETABOLISM; THALAMIC HYPOMETABOLISM; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; SURGERY OUTCOMES; MRI; PATTERNS	Objective: Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is an established, independent, strong predictor of surgical outcome in refractory epilepsy. In this study, we explored the added value of quantitative [18F]FDG-PET features combined with clinical variables, including electroencephalography (EEG), [18F]FDG-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) qualitative interpretations, to predict long-term seizure recurrence (mean post-op follow-up of 5.85 +/- 3.77 years). Methods: Machine learning predictive models of surgical outcome were created using a random forest classifier trained on quantitative features in 89 patients with drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy evaluated at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania epilepsy surgery program (2003-2016). Quantitative features were calculated from asymmetry features derived from image processing using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). Results: The best-performing model used quantification and had an out-of-bag accuracy of 0.71 in identifying patients with seizure recurrence (Engel IB or worse) which outperformed that using qualitative clinical data by 10%. This model is shared through open-source software for research use. In addition, several asymmetry features in temporal and extratemporal regions that were significantly associated with seizure freedom are identified for future study. Significance: Complex quantitative [18F]FDG-PET imaging features can predict seizure recurrence in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. These initial retrospective results in a cohort with long-term follow-up suggest that using quantitative imaging features from regions in the epileptogenic network can inform the clinical decision-making process.

J	Daly, I				Daly, Ian			Neural component analysis: A spatial filter for electroencephalogram analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Source localisation; EEG; Blind source separation; Source modelling	EEG; BRAIN; ARTIFACTS; P3A; CONDUCTIVITY; ALGORITHMS; SEPARATION; MOVEMENT; REMOVAL	Background: Spatial filtering and source separation are valuable tools in the analysis of EEG data. However, despite the well-known spatial localisation of individual cognitive processes within the brain, the available methods for source separation, such as the widely used blind source separation technique, do not take into account the spatial distributions and locations of sources. This can result in sub-optimal source identification. New method: We present a new method for deriving a spatial filter for EEG data that attempts to identify sources that are maximally spatially distinct from one another in terms of the spatial distributions of their projections. Results: We first evaluate our method with simulated EEG and show that it is able to separate EEG signals into components with distinct spatial distributions that closely resemble the original simulated sources. We also evaluate our method with real EEG and show it is able to identify a spatial filter that can be used to significantly improve classification accuracy of the P300 event-related potential (ERP). Comparison with existing methods: We compare our method to a state of the art blind source separation methods, fast independent component analysis (ICA) and common spatial patterns (CSP). We evaluate the methods suitability for a common source separation application, analysis of ERPs. Conclusions: Our results show that our method is well suited to identifying spatial filters for EEG analysis. This has potential applications in a wide range of EEG signal processing applications.

Here, we analyzed two different datasets where fine hand movements (touch, grasp, palmar, and lateral grasp) were performed in a self-paced modality. We trained and tested a newly proposed CNN, and we compared its classification performance with two well-established machine learning models, namely, shrinkage-linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Random Forest (RF). Compared to previous literature, we included neuroscientific evidence, and we trained our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on the so-called movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs). They are EEG amplitude modulations at low frequencies, i.e., (0.3,3) Hz that have been proved to encode several properties of the movements, e.g., type of grasp, force level, and speed. We showed that CNN achieved good performance in both datasets (accuracy of 0.70 +/- 0.11 and 0.64 +/- 0.10, for the two datasets, respectively), and they were similar or superior to the baseline models (accuracy of 0.68 +/- 0.10 and 0.62 +/- 0.07 with sLDA; accuracy of 0.70 +/- 0.15 and 0.61 +/- 0.07 with RF, with comparable performance in precision and recall). In addition, compared to the baseline, our CNN requires a faster pre-processing procedure, paving the way for its possible use in online BCI applications.

J	Naser, DS; Saha, G				Naser, Daimi Syed; Saha, Goutam			Influence of music liking on EEG based emotion recognition	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform (DT-CWPT); Functional connectivity; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Music liking; Emotion recognition	FRONTAL BRAIN ASYMMETRY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORE AFFECT; MUTUAL INFORMATION; WAVELET PACKET; TIME-COURSE; GAMMA-BAND; RESPONSES; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS	In studies of emotions, music is usually used to induce the emotions that are measured on the arousal-valence/arousal-valence-dominance scales. However, the influence of music liking (that depends on individual preference and appraisal) on the induced emotions is often ignored. This work presents a novel study on the influence of liking on arousal, valence, and dominance using a signal processing and pattern recognition framework. Emotion recognition was performed using a feature-level fusion of three features together with feature selection method and a classifier. The features were derived from wavelet decomposition of EEG, pairwise functional connectivity, and graph-theoretic measures that reflect characteristics of an individual electrode, pair of electrodes, and topological properties of the brain networks, respectively. Here, classification is done between the high/low categories of each of the arousal, valence, and dominance scales under three different cases of music liking. The study shows that the classification performances of arousal, valence, and dominance were 22.50%, 14.87%, and 19.44% above the empirical chance-level, respectively. The fusion framework gave up to 5% relative improvement over individual features. The study indicates that liking influences classification performance and also the temporal dynamics of emotional experience across these scales. We observe an inverted U relationship between the level of liking and arousal and dominance classification performance. We also analyzed the feature and electrode usage and specific aspects of brain activity at different levels of liking. This reveals the importance of high-frequency bands and hemispheric features in emotion recognition.

There are mainly three stages (steps) in the brain wave classification:(i) pre-processing, ii) feature extraction, and iii) classification. This work provides a review of interpretation methods of Brain signals (Electroencephalogram (EEG)) EEG during yoga and meditation. Past research has revealed significant mental and physical advantages with yoga and meditation. Methods: The research topic reviewed focused on the machine learning strategies applied for the interpretation of brain waves. In addressing the research questions highlighted earlier in the general introduction, we conducted a systematic search of articles from targeted scientific and journal online databases that included PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library (IEEE), and Arxiv databases based on their relevance to the research questions and domain topic. The survey topic is relatively nascent, and therefore, the scope of the search period was limited to the 20-year timeline that was deemed representative of the research topic under investigation. The literature search was based on the keywords "EEG", "yoga*" and "meditation*". The key phrases were concatenated using Boolean expressions and applied to search through the selected online databases yielding a total of 120 articles. The online databases were selected based on the relevancy of content with the research title, research questions, and the domain application. The literature review search, process, and classification were carefully conducted guided by two defined measures; 1.) Inclusion criteria; and 2.) Exclusion criteria. These measures define the criteria for searching and extracting relevant articles relating to the research title and domain of interest. Results: Our literature search and review indicate a broad spectrum of neural mechanics under a variety of meditation styles have been investigated. A detailed analysis of various mental states using Zen, CHAN, mindfulness, TM, Rajayoga, Kundalini, Yoga, and other meditation styles have been described by means of EEG bands. Classification of mental states using KNN, SVM, Random forest, Fuzzy logic, neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks has been described. Superior research is still required to classify the EEG signatures corresponding to different mental states. Conclusions: Yoga practice may be an effective adjunctive treatment for a clinical and aging population. Advanced research can examine the effects of specific branches of yoga on a designated clinical grouping. Yoga and meditation increased overall healthy brain activity.

The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered an effective means to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). Doctors diagnose MCI based on various clinical examinations, which are expensive and the diagnosis results rely on the knowledge of doctors. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a robot diagnostic system to eliminate the influence of human factors and obtain a higher accuracy rate. In this paper, we propose a novel Group Feature Domain Adversarial Neural Network (GF-DANN) for amnestic MCI (aMCI) diagnosis, which involves two important modules. A Group Feature Extraction (GFE) module is proposed to reduce individual differences by learning group-level features through adversarial learning. A Dual Branch Domain Adaptation (DBDA) module is carefully designed to reduce the distribution difference between the source and target domain in a domain adaption way. On three types of data set, GF-DANN achieves the best accuracy compared with classic machine learning and deep learning methods. On the DMS data set, GF-DANN has obtained an accuracy rate of 89.47%, and the sensitivity and specificity are 90% and 89%. In addition, by comparing three EEG data collection paradigms, our results demonstrate that the DMS paradigm has the potential to build an aMCI diagnose robot system.

Recently, neuroelectrophysiological studies incorporating evidence-based medicine has provided an important approach and achieved abundant results to achieve this goal. However, there are still many controversies among current evidences, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. This article comprehensively summarized the results of psychiatric studies on mental disorders which combined the method of evidence-based medicine represented by meta-analysis and the neuroelectrophysiological technique represented by electroencephalography (EEG). To systematically analyze and summarize the neurocognitive dysfunction of mental disorders and high-risk groups, event-related potential (ERP) components are divided into early and late components including different cognitive activities such as perception processing, cognitive control, emotional response, and social cognition. Evidence based on quantitative EEG analysis are also discussed. We found that schizophrenia has defects in most of cognitive processes including perception, emotion and sociality, which indexed by amplitude reduction in most of the early and late components including P50, MMN, P300 and LPP. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has defects in cognitive control indexed by amplitude reduction in the early and late components including the ERN and Pe. Anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder have defects in early cognitive control, while autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has defects in early perceptual processing and social cognition indexed by amplitude reduction of N170 and FN. In addition, abnormal P300 reflexing the impaired cognitive processing speed and attention resource allocation were found across multiple diagnosis types, which indicate that this ERP component may reflect the general cognitive deficits of mental disorders. The neuroelectrophysiological studies on evidence-based medicine for mental disorders has discovered a series of valuable ERPs or EEG objective marker features, but these features still cannot be directly used in the diagnosis of personalized medicine, until these features have been identified as objective biomarkers with high accuracy and specificity in further research and clinical practice. Future research can use multi-center database to seek the electrophysiological objective markers for mental disorders, and the integrated research combining advanced technologies including multi-modal psychoradiology and artificial intelligence methods including machine learning can further enhance the reliability and validity of biological markers of mental disorders.

We present an experimental design for fatigue identification in a language understanding task. The EEG signals of 14 channels from 15 healthy participants were collected via a wireless brain computer interface device to indicate instantaneous fatigue level. By extracting EEG features as temporal statistics, power spectral density and entropy indicators, we build four different spatial feature maps that restructure feature vectors. Further, a bootstrapaggregating ensemble convolutional neural network of multi-domain features (ensCNN-MD) is proposed to improve the fatigue recognition accuracy. By examining seven different feature combinations, ensCNN-MD is significantly superior to classical shallow and deep classifiers. The highest classification accuracy under participant-specific training and testing paradigm is achieved at 87.69%. The results demonstrate both the effectiveness of experimental design and the ensCNN-MD of learning high-level spatial feature abstractions related to mental fatigue variations.

Our sample (N=1376) included individuals of European (EA) and African (AA) ancestry from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) who were initially assessed as having AUD (DSM-5) and reassessed years later as either having AUD or in remission. To predict this difference in AUD recovery status, we analyzed the initial data using multimodal, multi-features machine learning applications including EEG source-level functional brain connectivity, Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), medications, and demographic information. Sex and ancestry age-matched stratified analyses were performed with supervised linear Support Vector Machine application and were calculated twice, once when the ancestry was defined by self-report and once defined by genetic data. Multifeatured prediction models achieved higher accuracy scores than models based on a single domain and higher scores in male models when the ancestry was based on genetic data. The AA male group model with PRS, EEG functional connectivity, marital and employment status features achieved the highest accuracy of 86.04%. Several discriminative features were identified, including collections of PRS related to neuroticism, depression, aggression, years of education, and alcohol consumption phenotypes. Other discriminated features included being married, employed, medication, lower default mode network and fusiform connectivity, and higher insula connectivity. Results highlight the importance of increasing genetic homogeneity of analyzed groups, identifying sex, and ancestry-specific features to increase prediction scores revealing biomarkers related to AUD remission.

However, this method has some drawbacks, especially when a few labeled samples are available. The local activities estimation (LAE) method works well with small training sets, but it is more sensitive to the position of the electrodes. Here, we suggest a combination of the LAE and CSP, namely LAE-CSP, which performs better than both methods. Methods: In LAE-CSP, the EEG signal passes through regularized CSP and LAE spatial filters after band-pass filtering and then the data dimension are reduced based on the physiological data. Afterwards, the features are extracted using fast Fourier transform (FFT). In this work, CSP, FBRCSP, EA-CSP, LAE and LAE-CSP, methods were evaluated and compared. Three sets of motor imagery data from BCI competition III and IV along with Cho et al. dataset, including EEG signals from 28 subjects were used in this study. For each dataset, the training set were selected in 21 different sizes. Results: LAE-CSP performs better than all tested methods. Particularly it has good performance using only ten labeled samples per class, with an average accuracy of almost 80 %. Conclusions: LAE-CSP reliably enhances the performance of the motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces. Significance: The LAE-CSP takes advantage of the LAE and CSP and compensates for the drawbacks of both methods.

For example, early diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) requires a wide variety of tests to distinguish MCI symptoms and normal consequences of aging. In this article, we use the wavelet-skeleton approach to find some characteristic patterns in the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of healthy adult patients and patients with cognitive dysfunctions. We analyze the EEG activity recorded during natural sleep of 11 elderly patients aged between 60 and 75, six of whom have mild cognitive impairment, and apply a nonlinear analysis method based on continuous wavelet transformskeletons. Our studies show that a comprehensive analysis of EEG signals of the entire sleep state allows us to identify a significant decrease in the average duration of oscillatory patterns in the frequency band [12; 14] Hz in the presence of mild cognitive impairment. Thus, the changes in this frequency range can be interpreted as related to the activity in the motor cortex, as a candidate for developing the criteria for early objective MCI.

Over the past decade, advances in artificial intelligence have expanded and reshaped many industries. It also affected neuroscience, where machine learning made possible to find practical use for electroencephalogram signals in the brain in various fields of engineering. As a result, popularity of brain-computer interface devices used for recording brain signals at low-cost has increased dramatically. In recent years, several companies started manufacturing devices capable of recording EEG signals using non-invasive electrodes at low cost. Even then, the cost of these devices often exceeds 1000USD. In this paper, we aim for yet further cost reduction by proposing a Raspberry PI -based device for reading EEG signal. According to its characteristics, the device is compared to the signal-to-noise level of the ADS1299 device produced by Texas instruments and used for comparison in this paper. The proposed device, on top of satisfying noise level and accuracy of detected artifacts in the signal, was also tested and confirmed to successfully resist the effect of electromagnetic interference, successfully detect the alpha brain wave, and detect the P300 paradigm.

Prior researchers used biosignal time-series data to reflect the variation in factors associated with depression. In addition, machine learning algorithms were applied to determine the underlying relationships between depressive symptoms and these factors. In this study, we introduce a classification framework for depression levels using actigraphy data based on machine learning algorithms. Fourteen circadian rhythm features (minimum, amplitude, alpha, beta, acrotime, upmesor, downmesor, mesor, f_pseudo, interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV), relative amplitude (RA), M10, and L5) extracted from accelerometer-based actigraphy data were used to model depression status with survey variables. Six evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve) were applied to validate the performance of the proposed framework. Among the four candidate classifiers (XGBoost classifier, support vector classifier, multilayer perceptron, and logistic regression), the XGBoost classifier was the best at classifying depression levels. Moreover, we confirmed that the actigraphy data of two days were optimal for feature extraction and classification. The results of this study provide novel insights into the relationship between depression and physical activity in terms of both identification of depression and application of actigraphy data.

Despite the advances in the field, BCIs are still far from the subject-independent decoding of brain activities, primarily due to substantial inter-subject variability. In this study, we examine the potential application of an ensemble CNN classifier to integrate the capabilities of CNN architectures and ensemble learning for decoding EEG signals collected in motor imagery experiments. The results prove the superiority of the proposed ensemble CNN in comparison with the average base CNN classifiers, with an improvement up to 9% in classification accuracy depending on the test subject. The results also show improvement with respect to the performance of a number of state-of-the-art methods that have been previously used for subject-independent classification in the same datasets used here (i.e., BCI Competition IV 2A and 2B datasets).

Deep participation of patients with stroke in active rehabilitation training using motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can greatly improve the rehabilitation efficiency. At present, the brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery is mostly in the laboratory research stage, and the participants are mostly healthy people. Understanding EEG differences between healthy people and stroke patients is important. A Novel EEG decoding algorithm is proposed based on this present situation, which adopt the strategy of multi-domain feature complementary fusion in feature extraction, and the ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model. Multi-scale features were extracted from time domain, frequency domain, space domain and time-frequency domain for fusion, to effectively utilize them to improve the classification accuracy. The ensemble linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier based on Boosting algorithm is proposed to make boosting in the multidomain feature level, and extract and optimize the most discriminative features from the high-dimensional feature combination space, which maximizes the ratio of the discreteness between inter-class and intra-class. Then, the public dataset and the collected EEG dataset of healthy subjects and stroke patients are used to validated the effective of proposed algorithm, and neural activation characteristics of participants during motor imagery processing are analyzed. Compared with the single feature classification algorithm, the proposed method has better positive effects on classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa, which opens up new possibilities for the usage of brain-controlled active rehabilitation devices.

Magnetic-resonance-based measurement of electromagnetic fields and conductivity in vivo using single current administration-A machine learning approach	PLOS ONE			English	Article							IMPEDANCE TOMOGRAPHY MREIT; PROJECTED CURRENT-DENSITY; ONE-COMPONENT; FLUX DENSITY; RECONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION; ALGORITHM; HEAD; EEG	Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (DT-MREIT) is a newly developed technique that combines MR-based measurements of magnetic flux density with diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) data to reconstruct electrical conductivity tensor distributions. DT-MREIT techniques normally require injection of two independent current patterns for unique reconstruction of conductivity characteristics. In this paper, we demonstrate an algorithm that can be used to reconstruct the position dependent scale factor relating conductivity and diffusion tensors, using flux density data measured from only one current injection. We demonstrate how these images can also be used to reconstruct electric field and current density distributions. Reconstructions were performed using a mimetic algorithm and simulations of magnetic flux density from complementary electrode montages, combined with a small-scale machine learning approach. In a biological tissue phantom, we found that the method reduced relative errors between single-current and two-current DT-MREIT results to around 10%. For in vivo human experimental data the error was about 15%. These results suggest that incorporation of machine learning may make it easier to recover electrical conductivity tensors and electric field images during neuromodulation therapy without the need for multiple current administrations.

The characteristics of high immersion and interactivity enhance virtual reality (VR) application in psychological therapy. Many studies have verified the effectiveness of VR relaxation therapy, although a few have performed a quantitative study on relaxation state (R-state). To confirm the effectiveness of VR relaxation and quantitatively assess relaxation, this study confirmed the effectiveness of the VR sightseeing relaxation scenes using subjective emotion scale and objective electroencephalogram (EEG) data from college students. Moreover, some EEG features with significant consistent differences after they watched the VR scenes were detected including the energy ratio of the alpha wave, gamma wave, and differential asymmetry. An R-state regression model was then built using the model stacking method for optimization, of which random forest regression, AdaBoost, gradient boosting (GB), and light GB were adopted as the first level, while linear regression and support vector machine were applied at the second level. The leave-one-subject-out method for cross-validation was used to evaluate the results, where the mean accuracy of the framework achieved 81.46%. The significantly changed features and the R-state model with over 80% accuracy have laid a foundation for further research on relaxation interaction systems. Moreover, the VR relaxation therapy was applied to the clinical treatment of patients with depression and achieved preliminary good results, which might provide a possible method for non-drug treatment of patients with depression.</p>	[Zhang, Yue; Hua, Haoqiang; Jin, Jianxiu; Zhu, Lingqing; Shu, Lin; Xu, Xiangmin; Kuang, Feng; Liu, Yunhe] South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lulu] South China Univ Technol, Affiliated Hosp 2, Guangzhou Peoples Hosp 1, Dept Psychiat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiangmin] South China Univ Technol, Zhongshan Inst Modern Ind Technol, Zhongshan, Peoples R China		Shu, L (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.	shul@scut.edu.cn		Hua, Haoqiang/0000-0001-5436-4457	Major Science and Technology Projects in Guangdong Province [2016B010108008]; Technology Program of Guangzhou [202002030354, 202002030262]; Science and Technology Project of Zhongshan [2019AG024, 2020B2053]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310407]; Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Body Data Science [201605030011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61972163, 61806210]	Major Science and Technology Projects in Guangdong Province; Technology Program of Guangzhou; Science and Technology Project of Zhongshan; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Body Data Science; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This work was supported in part by the Major Science and Technology Projects in Guangdong Province under Grant 2016B010108008, in part by the Technology Program of Guangzhou under Grants 202002030354 and 202002030262, in part by the Science and Technology Project of Zhongshan under Grants 2019AG024 and 2020B2053, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province under Grant 2018A030310407, in part by the Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Body Data Science under Grant 201605030011, and in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants 61972163 and 61806210.		56	0	0	9	26	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		1662-453X		FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ	Front.

This disorder can affect human life considerably. Early detection of OSA can protect human health from different diseases including cardiovascular diseases which may lead to sudden death. OSA is examined by physicians using Electrocardiography (ECG) signals, Electromyogram (EMG), Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrooculography (EOG) and oxygen saturation. Previous studies of detecting OSA are focused on using feature engineering where a specific number of features from ECG signals are selected as an input to the machine learning model. In this study, we focus on detecting OSA from ECG signals where our proposed machine learning methods automatically extract the input as features from ECG signals. We proposed three architectures of deep learning approaches in this study: CNN, CNN with LSTM and CNN with GRU. These architectures utilized consecutive R interval and QRS complex amplitudes as inputs. Thirty-five recordings from PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database have been used to evaluate our models. Experimental results show that our architecture of CNN with LSTM performed best for OSA detection. The average classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity achieved in this study are 89.11%, 89.91% and 87.78% respectively.

Subjects must learn to modulate their brain activities to ensure a successful BCI. Feedback training is a practical approach to this learning process; however, the commonly used classifier-dependent approaches have inherent limitations such as the need for calibration and a lack of continuous feedback over long periods of time. This paper proposes an online data visualization feedback protocol that intuitively reflects the EEG distribution in Riemannian geometry in real time. Rather than learning a hyperplane, the Riemannian geometry formulation allows iterative learning of prototypical covariance matrices that are translated into visualized feedback through diffusion map process. Ten subjects were recruited for MI-BCI (motor imagery-BCI) training experiments. The subjects learned to modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to centralize the points within one category and to separate points belonging to different categories. The results show favorable overall training effects in terms of the class distinctiveness and EEG feature discriminancy over a 3-day training with 30% learners. A steadily increased class distinctiveness in the last three sessions suggests that the advanced training protocol is effective. The optimal frequency band was consistent during the 3-day training, and the difference between subjects with good or low MI-BCI performance could be clearly observed. We believe that the proposed feedback protocol has promising application prospect.

This interacting relationship, known as the Functional Connectivity Network (FCN), is critical for brain functions. To learn the FCN, machine learning algorithms can be built based on brain signals captured by sensing technologies such as EEG and fMRI. In neurological diseases, past research has revealed that the FCN is altered. Also, focusing on a specific disease, some part of the FCN, i.e., a sub-network can be more susceptible than other parts. However, the current knowledge about disease-specific sub-networks is limited. We propose a novel Discriminant Subgraph Learner (DSL) to identify a functional sub-network that best differentiates patients with a specific disease from healthy controls based on brain sensory data. We develop an integrated optimization framework for DSL to simultaneously learn the FCN of each class and identify the discriminant sub-network. Further, we develop tractable and converging algorithms to solve the optimization. We apply DSL to identify a functional sub-network that best differentiates patients with episodic migraine from healthy controls based on a fMRI dataset. DSL achieved the best accuracy compared to five stateof-the-art competing algorithms.

Choosing the right dimensional reduction method can lead to a reduction in the data processing time. Evolutionary algorithms are one of the methods used to reduce the dimensions in the field of EEG brain signals, which have shown better performance than other common methods. In this article, (1) a new Bond Graph algorithm (BGA) is introduced that has demonstrated better performance on eight benchmark functions compared to genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. Our algorithm has fast convergence and does not get stuck in local optimums. (2) Reductions of features, electrodes, and the frequency range have been evaluated simultaneously for brain signals (left-handed and right-handed). BGA and other algorithms are used to reduce features. (3) Feature extraction and feature selection (with algorithms) for time domain, frequency domain, wavelet coefficients, and autoregression have been studied as well as electrode reduction and frequency interval reduction. (4) First, the features/properties (algorithms) are reduced, the electrodes are reduced, and the frequency range is reduced, which is followed by the construction of new signals based on the proposed formulas. Then, a Common Spatial Pattern is used to remove noise and feature extraction and is classified by a classifier. (5) A separate study with a deep sampling method has been implemented as feature selection in several layers with functions and different window sizes. This part is also associated with reducing the feature and reducing the frequency range. All items expressed in data set IIa from BCI competition IV (the left hand and right hand) have been evaluated between one and three channels, with better results for similar cases (in close proximity). Our method demonstrated an increased accuracy by 5 to 8% and an increased kappa by 5%.

Most mental arithmetic recognition systems rely on features of a single channel of EEG; however, the relationships between EEG channels in the form of effective brain connectivity analysis can contain valuable information. This study aims to find distinctive, effective brain connectivity features and create a hierarchical feature selection for effectively classifying mental arithmetic and baseline tasks. Methods: We estimated effective connectivity using Directed Transfer Function (DTF), direct DTF (dDTF) and Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (GPDC) methods. These measures determine the causal relationship between different brain areas. A hierarchical feature subset selection method selects the most significant effective connectivity features Initially, Kruskal- Wallis tent was performed. Consequently, five feature selection algorithms, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) method based on Recursive Feature Elimination, Fisher score, mutual information, minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (RMR), and concave minimization and SVM are used to select the bent discriminative features. Finally, the SVM method was used for classification. Results: The obtained results indicated that the best EEG classification performance in 29 participants and 60 trials is obtained using GPDC and feature selection via concave minimization method in Beta2 (15-22Hz) frequency band with 89% accuracy. Conclusions: This new hierarchical automated system could be helpful in the discrimination of mental arithmetic and baseline tasks from EEG signals effectively.

In this context, a level-crossing sampling and adaptive-rate processing based innovative method is suggested for an effective and automated epileptic seizures diagnosis. The suggested solution can achieve a significant real-time compression in computational complexity and transmission activity reduction. The proposed method acquires the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal by using the level-crossing analog-to-digital converter (LCADC) and selects its active segments by using the activity selection algorithm (ASA). This effectively pilots the post adaptive-rate modules such as denoising, wavelet based sub bands decomposition, and dimension reduction. The University of Bonn and Hauz Khas epilepsy-detection databases are used to evaluate the proposed approach. Experiments show that the proposed system achieves a 4.1-fold and 3.7-fold decline, respectively, for University of Bonn and Hauz Khas datasets, in the number of samples obtained as opposed to traditional counterparts. This results in a reduction of the computational complexity of the proposed adaptive-rate processing approach by more than 14-fold. It promises a noticeable reduction in transmitter power, the use of bandwidth, and cloud-based classifier computational load. The overall accuracy of the method is also quantified in terms of the epilepsy classification performance. The proposed system achieves100% classification accuracy for most of the studied cases. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While current aerospace systems and interfaces are limited in their adaptability, a Cognitive Human Machine System (CHMS) aims to perform dynamic, real-time system adaptation by estimating the cognitive states of the human operator. Nevertheless, to reliably drive system adaptation of current and emerging aerospace systems, there is a need to accurately and repeatably estimate cognitive states, particularly for Mental Workload (MWL), in real-time. As part of this study, two sessions were performed during a Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) scenario, including a session for offline calibration and validation and a session for online validation of eleven multimodal inference models of MWL. The multimodal inference model implemented included an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), which was used in different configurations to fuse data from an Electroencephalogram (EEG) model's output, four eye activity features and a control input feature. The online validation of the ANFIS models produced good results, while the best performing model (containing all four eye activity features and the control input feature) showed an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 0.67 +/- 0.18 and Correlation Coefficient (CC) = 0.71 +/- 0.15. The remaining six ANFIS models included data from the EEG model's output, which had an offset discrepancy. This resulted in an equivalent offset for the online multimodal fusion. Nonetheless, the efficacy of these ANFIS models could be confirmed by the pairwise correlation with the task level, where one model demonstrated a CC = 0.77 +/- 0.06, which was the highest among all of the ANFIS models tested. Hence, this study demonstrates the suitability for online multimodal fusion of features extracted from EEG signals, eye activity and control inputs to produce an accurate and repeatable inference of MWL.

Using interictal seizure-free EEG data to recognise patients with epilepsy based on machine learning of brain functional connectivity	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						qEEG; Classification; Brain connectivity; Correlation; Coherence	SCALP EEG; COMMON; SYNCHRONIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; WAKEFULNESS; ALGORITHMS; DIAGNOSIS; NETWORK; MODEL	Most seizures in adults with epilepsy occur rather infrequently and as a result, the interictal EEG plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and classification of epilepsy. However, empirical interpretation, of a first EEG in adult patients, has a very low sensitivity ranging between 29?55 %. Useful EEG information remains buried within the signals in seizure-free EEG epochs, far beyond the observational capabilities of any specialised physician in this field. Unlike most of the existing works focusing on either seizure data or single-variate method, we introduce a multi-variate method to characterise sensor level brain functional connectivity from interictal EEG data to identify patients with generalised epilepsy. A total of 9 connectivity features based on 5 different measures in time, frequency and time-frequency domains have been tested. The solution has been validated by the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, classifying an epilepsy group (EG) vs healthy controls (HC) and subsequently with another cohort of patients characterised by non-epileptic attacks (NEAD), a psychogenic type of disorder. A high classification accuracy (97 %) was achieved for EG vs HC while revealing significant spatio-temporal deficits in the frontocentral areas in the beta frequency band. For EG vs NEAD, the classification accuracy was only about 73 %, which might be a reflection of the well-described coexistence of NEAD with epileptic attacks. Our work demonstrates that seizure-free interictal EEG data can be used to accurately classify patients with generalised epilepsy from HC and that more systematic work is required in this direction aiming to produce a clinically useful diagnostic method.

In this paper, we pioneer this idea by directly applying natural images to stimulate human brains and then collect the corresponding electroencephalogram (EEG) sequences to drive a deep framework to learn and visualize the corresponding brain activities. By examining the relevance between the visualized image and the stimulation image, we are able to assess the performance of our proposed deep framework in terms of not only the quality of such visualization but also the feasibility of introducing the new concept of "brain-media". To ensure that our explorative research is meaningful, we introduce a dually conditioned learning mechanism in the proposed deep framework. One condition is analyzing EEG sequences through deep learning to extract a more compact and class-dependent brain features via exploiting those unique characteristics of human brains such as hemispheric lateralization and biological neurons myelination (neurons importance), and the other is to analyze the content of images via computing approaches and extract representative visual features to exploit artificial intelligence in assisting our automated analysis of brain activities and their visualizations. By combining the brain feature space with the associated visual feature space of those images that are candidates of the stimuli, we are able to generate a combined-conditional space to support the proposed dual-conditioned and lateralization-supported GAN framework. Extensive experiments carried out illustrate that our proposed deep framework significantly outperforms the existing relevant work, indicating that our proposed does provide a good potential for further research upon the introduced concept of "brain-media", a new member for the big family of multimedia.

An automated seizure detector that requires a short period of normal EEG would shorten the seizure monitoring durations, decrease the need for manual assessment of large amount of recorded EEG data, and accordingly assist the neurologists focus on improving quality of care. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on the extended cumulative sum test to detect seizures using intracranial EEG. Different than the existing machine learning approaches, this method requires only a short period of normal EEG for training. In addition to a new proposed feature based on partial directed coherence and random graph theory, in this work, previously developed features used to characterize seizures are used as features in cumulative sum test for seizure detection. A total of 33 intracranial EEG recordings collected from a total of 9 patients corresponding to three different datasets have been used for the analysis purposes: (i) the first dataset includes 11 recorded EEG files (-12.5 min) from 4 patients; (ii) the second dataset includes 20 recorded EEG files (-30 min) from 4 patients; and (iii) two 24-hour long EEG files from a single patient. The proposed detector achieved a mean sensitivity and mean specificity for the first (0.77, 0.86), second (0.88, 0.9) and third datasets (0.92, 0.94) respectively. Statistical detection of seizures has shown success in detecting seizures without the need for highly customizable parameters or previously labelled EEG data. The proposed method could be used in real-time at hospital settings with a minimum requirement of training data.

Here, we investigated how this learning process changes the neural encoding of natural speech by assessing the encoding of the linguistic feature hierarchy in second-language listeners. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from native Mandarin speakers with varied English proficiency and from native English speakers while they listened to audio-stories in English. We measured the temporal response functions (TRFs) for acoustic, phonemic, phonotactic, and semantic features in individual participants and found a main effect of proficiency on linguistic encoding. This effect of second-language proficiency was particularly prominent on the neural encoding of phonemes, showing stronger encoding of "new" phonemic contrasts (i.e., English contrasts that do not exist in Mandarin) with increasing proficiency. Overall, we found that the nonnative listeners with higher proficiency levels had a linguistic feature representation more similar to that of native listeners, which enabled the accurate decoding of language proficiency. This result advances our understanding of the cortical processing of linguistic information in second-language learners and provides an objective measure of language proficiency.

J	Montoya-Martinez, J; Vanthornhout, J; Bertrand, A; Francart, T				Montoya-Martinez, Jair; Vanthornhout, Jonas; Bertrand, Alexander; Francart, Tom			Effect of number and placement of EEG electrodes on measurement of neural tracking of speech	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RESPONSES; SELECTION; BRAIN	Measurement of neural tracking of natural running speech from the electroencephalogram (EEG) is an increasingly popular method in auditory neuroscience and has applications in audiology. The method involves decoding the envelope of the speech signal from the EEG signal, and calculating the correlation with the envelope of the audio stream that was presented to the subject. Typically EEG systems with 64 or more electrodes are used. However, in practical applications, set-ups with fewer electrodes are required. Here, we determine the optimal number of electrodes, and the best position to place a limited number of electrodes on the scalp. We propose a channel selection strategy based on an utility metric, which allows a quick quantitative assessment of the influence of a channel (or a group of channels) on the reconstruction error. We consider two use cases: a subject-specific case, where the optimal number and position of the electrodes is determined for each subject individually, and a subject-independent case, where the electrodes are placed at the same positions (in the 10-20 system) for all the subjects. We evaluated our approach using 64-channel EEG data from 90 subjects. In the subject-specific case we found that the correlation between actual and reconstructed envelope first increased with decreasing number of electrodes, with an optimum at around 20 electrodes, yielding 29% higher correlations using the optimal number of electrodes compared to all electrodes. This means that our strategy of removing electrodes can be used to improve the correlation metric in high-density EEG recordings. In the subject-independent case, we obtained a stable decoding performance when decreasing from 64 to 22 channels. When the number of channels was further decreased, the correlation decreased. For a maximal decrease in correlation of 10%, 32 well-placed electrodes were sufficient in 91% of the subjects.

The literature shows values of accuracies ranging from 60x0025; to 99x0025; while using similar classifiers when tested on the same data set. The study included a literature review of 65 articles testing their algorithms on the DEAP data set up until 2019. Moreover, the study involved the reimplementation of a neural network classifier in both nested and nonnested cross-validation methods. The results show accuracies up to 90x0025; when using nonnested cross validation, while nested cross-validation achieves accuracies around 60x0025;. This article aims to motivate researchers to clearly describe their cross-validation method to avoid confusing other researchers when benchmarking their algorithms.

Cross-subject MW analysis based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an important way. In this paper, a fine-grained and multi-scale motif (FGMSM) features extraction method is proposed, and the proposed features together with original EEG data are used as the input of bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) to evaluate the cross-subject mental workload. First, the EEG signal of each channel is decomposed based on improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) algorithm. Second, for the motif structure consisting of three nodes, multi-scale detection is carried out in each intrinsic mode function, and the proportion of each motif structure is extracted as the newly extracted features. Then, the statistical differences of the extracted features between different MW levels are analyzed by using the t-test, and the features with statistical differences are selected for the cross-subject MW assessment. Finally, based on the public dataset with 26 subjects, Bi-LSTM and a variety of machine learning algorithms are used to classify the levels of cross-subject MW. The results show that the Bi-LSTM classification method with the original EEG data and the proposed features show the most positive results. Therefore, the FGMSM features proposed in this paper with Bi-LSTM provide a new technique for the assessment of cross-subject MW based on EEG signals.

J	Ansari, S; Naghdy, F; Du, HP; Pahnwar, YN				Ansari, Shahzeb; Naghdy, Fazel; Du, Haiping; Pahnwar, Yasmeen Naz			Driver Mental Fatigue Detection Based on Head Posture Using New Modified reLU-BiLSTM Deep Neural Network	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						Vehicles; Fatigue; Magnetic heads; Monitoring; Biomedical monitoring; Tools; Vehicle dynamics; Driver behaviour; mental fatigue detection; head posture; deep learning model; reLU-BiLSTM	REAL-TIME SYSTEM; ALERTNESS; BEHAVIOR; EEG	Early detection of driver mental fatigue is one of the active areas of research in smart and intelligent vehicles. There are various methods, based on measuring the physiological characteristics of the driver utilising sensors and computer vision, proposed in the literature. In general, driver behaviour is unpredictable that can suddenly change the nature of driving and dynamics under mental fatigue. This results in sudden variations in driver body posture and head movement, with consequent inattentive behaviour that can end in fatal accidents and crashes. In the process of delineating the different driving patterns of driver states while active or influenced by mental fatigue, this paper contributes to advancing direct measurement approaches. In the novel approach proposed in this paper, driver mental fatigue and drowsiness are measured by monitoring driver's head posture motions using XSENS motion capture system. The experiments were conducted on 15 healthy subjects on a MATHWORKS driver-in-loop (DIL) simulator, interfaced with Unreal Engine 4 studio. A new modified bidirectional long short-term memory deep neural network, based on a rectified linear unit layer, was designed, trained and tested on 3D time-series head angular acceleration data for sequence-to-sequence classification. The results showed that the proposed classifier outperformed state-of-art approaches and conventional machine learning tools, and successfully recognised driver's active, fatigue and transition states, with overall training accuracy of 99.2%, sensitivity of 97.54%, precision and F1 scores of 97.38% and 97.46%, respectively. The limitations of the current work and directions for future work are also explored.

Their main characteristic is a slowing in frequency in the electroencephalogram (EEG), similar to stage N1 sleep according to standard criteria. The maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) is often used in a clinical setting to assess vigilance. Scoring of the MWT in most sleep-wake centers is limited to classical definition of sleep (30 s epochs), and MSEs are mostly not considered in the absence of established scoring criteria defining MSEs but also because of the laborious work. We aimed for automatic detection of MSEs with machine learning, i.e., with deep learning based on raw EEG and EOG data as input. We analyzed MWT data of 76 patients. Experts visually scored wakefulness, and according to recently developed scoring criteria MSEs, microsleep episode candidates (MSEc), and episodes of drowsiness (ED). We implemented segmentation algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a combination of a CNN with a long-short term memory (LSTM) network. A LSTM network is a type of a recurrent neural network which has a memory for past events and takes them into account. Data of 53 patients were used for training of the classifiers, 12 for validation and 11 for testing. Our algorithms showed a good performance close to human experts. The detection was very good for wakefulness and MSEs and poor for MSEc and ED, similar to the low inter-expert reliability for these borderline segments. We performed a visualization of the internal representation of the data by the artificial neuronal network performing best using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Visualization revealed that MSEs and wakefulness were mostly separable, though not entirely, and MSEc and ED largely intersected with the two main classes. We provide a proof of principle that it is feasible to reliably detect MSEs with deep neuronal networks based on raw EEG and EOG data with a performance close to that of human experts. The code of the algorithms (https://github.com/alexander-malafeev/microsleep- detection) and data (https://zenodo.org/record/3251716) are available.

Our automatic sleep stage classification method contained preprocessing based on independent component analysis, feature extraction including spectral features, spectral edge frequency features, absolute spectral power, statistical features, Hjorth features, maximum-minimum distance and energy features, and a modified ReliefF feature selection. Finally, a support vector machine was employed to classify four states (awake, light sleep [LS], slow-wave sleep [SWS] and rapid eye movement [REM]). The overall accuracy of the Sleep-EDF database reached 90.10 ? 2.68% with a kappa coefficient of 0.87 ? 0.04. Furthermore, a depression recognition method was developed to distinguish the patients with depression from healthy subjects. Specifically, according to the differences in sleep patterns between the two groups, REM latency, sleep latency, LS proportion, SWS proportion, sleep maintenance and arousal times were employed in this study.

Practical use cases require a wearable solution where the classification of the brain signals is done locally near the sensor using machine learning models embedded on energy-efficient microcontroller units (MCUs), for assured privacy, user comfort, and long-term usage. In this work, we provide practical insights on the accuracy-cost trade-off for embedded BMI solutions. Our multispectral Riemannian classifier reaches 75.1% accuracy on a 4-class MI task. The accuracy is further improved by tuning different types of classifiers to each subject, achieving 76.4%. We further scale down the model by quantizing it to mixed-precision representations with a minimal accuracy loss of 1% and 1.4%, respectively, which is still up to 4.1% more accurate than the state-of-the-art embedded convolutional neural network. We implement the model on a low-power MCU within an energy budget of merely 198 $\mu$J and taking only 16.9 ms per classification. Classifying samples continuously, overlapping the 3.5 s samples by 50% to avoid missing user inputs allows for operation at just 85 $\mu$W. Compared to related works in embedded MI-BMIs, our solution sets the new state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy-energy trade-off for near-sensor classification.

The PSG records must be taken by a technician in a hospital environment, this may suggest a drawback. This study aims to develop a new method based on hybrid machine learning with single-channel ECG for sleep-wake detection, which is an alternative to the sleep staging procedure used in hospitals today. For this purpose, the heart rate variability signal was derived using electrocardiography (ECG) signals of 10 OSA patients. Then, QRS components in different frequency bands were obtained from the ECG signal by digital filtering. In this way, nine more signals were obtained in total. 25 features from each of the 9 signals, a total of 225 features have been extracted. Fisher feature selection algorithm and principal component analysis were used to reduce the number of features. Finally, features were classified with decision tree, support vector machines, k-nearest neighborhood algorithm and ensemble classifiers. In addition, the proposed model has been checked with the leave one out method. At the end of the study, it was shown that sleep-wake detection can be performed with 81.35% accuracy with only three features and 87.12% accuracy with 10 features. The sensitivity and specificity values for the 3 features were 0.85 and 0.77, and for 10 features the sensitivity and specificity values were 0.90 and 0.85 respectively. These results suggested that the proposed model could be used to detect sleep-wake stages during the OSA diagnostic process.

The Music of Silence: Part II: Music Listening Induces Imagery Responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; expectation; omission; predictive processing; TRF	BRAIN POTENTIALS; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; PREDICTION; MODEL; EXPECTATION; SOUND	During music listening, humans routinely acquire the regularities of the acoustic sequences and use them to anticipate and interpret the ongoing melody. Specifically, in line with this predictive framework, it is thought that brain responses during such listening reflect a comparison between the bottom-up sensory responses and top-down prediction signals generated by an internal model that embodies the music exposure and expectations of the listener. To attain a clear view of these predictive responses, previous work has eliminated the sensory inputs by inserting artificial silences (or sound omissions) that leave behind only the corresponding predictions of the thwarted expectations. Here, we demonstrate a new alternate approach in which we decode the predictive electroencephalography (EEG) responses to the silent intervals that are naturally interspersed within the music. We did this as participants (experiment 1, 20 participants, 10 female; experiment 2, 21 participants, 6 female) listened or imagined Bach piano melodies. Prediction signals were quantified and assessed via a computational model of the melodic structure of the music and were shown to exhibit the same response characteristics when measured during listening or imagining. These include an inverted polarity for both silence and imagined responses relative to listening, as well as response magnitude modulations that precisely reflect the expectations of notes and silences in both listening and imagery conditions. These findings therefore provide a unifying view that links results from many previous paradigms, including omission reactions and the expectation modulation of sensory responses, all in the context of naturalistic music listening.

Electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based detection of SI could assist in understanding SI neuroscientific causes that, as a result, could explain the SI role in student's learning. In this study, 26 participants were selected based on questionnaires to participate in the mathematics classroom experiment. SI and personal interest (PI) questionnaires along with knowledge tests were undertaken to measure student's interest and knowledge levels. A hybrid method combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform was developed and employed for feature extraction. The proposed method showed significant difference using the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test and consistently outperformed other methods in the classification performance using weighted k-nearest neighbours (wkNN). The high classification accuracy of 85.7% with the sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 90% revealed that brain oscillation patterns of high SI students are somewhat different than students with low or no SI. In addition, the result suggests that the delta rhythm could have a significant effect on cognitive processing.

Several applications have been developed with this principle, and BCIs are constantly growing due to their broad applicability. One of the brain signals acquisition methods is the electroencephalogram (EEG). On EEG-BCI, the signal commonly passes through the stages of temporal and spatial filtering, feature extraction, and classification. The Clinical BCI Challenge 2020 occurred to encourage new techniques and assess the state-of-the-art for motor classification of hemiparetic stroke patients. This work presents how we won the competition and the new approach single electrode energy (SEE) developed for this competition. The model proposed here took first place overall in the competition with a score equal to 15.500, which is 7.5% better than the score reached by the second-place team. This result shows that SEE is the best technique to classify the clinical data from the BCI Challenge among the methods presented in this competition and indicates a new way to classify the movements imagined by hemiparetic patients with stroke.

However, with the use of advanced features and machine learning approaches, EEG signals may be processed in an effective way, allowing fatigue to be detected promptly and efficiently. An optimal channel selection approach and a competent classification algorithm might be viewed as a critical aspect of efficient fatigue detection by the driver. In the present framework, a new channel selection algorithm based on correlation coefficients and an ensemble classifier based on random subspace k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) has been presented to enhance the classification performance of EEG data for driver fatigue detection. Moreover, power spectral density (PSD) was used to extract the feature, confirming the presented method's robustness. Additionally, to make the fatigue detection system faster, we conducted the experiment in three different time windows, including 0.5s, 0.75s, and 1s. It was found that the proposed method attained classification accuracy of 99.99% in a 0.5 second time window to identify driver fatigue by means of EEG. The outstanding performance of the presented framework can be used effectively in EEGbased driver fatigue detection.

With the development of clinical applications of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs), a single-channel MI-BCI system that can be easily assembled is an attractive goal. However, due to the low quality of the spectral power features in the traditional MI-BCI paradigm, the recognition performance of current single-channel systems is far lower than that of multi-channel systems, impeding their use in clinical applications. Approach. In this study, the subjects' right and left hands were stimulated simultaneously at different frequencies to induce steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEP). Subjects then performed motor imagery (MI) tasks. A new electroencephalography (EEG) index, inter-stimulus phase coherence (ISPC), was built to measure phase desynchronization of SSSEP caused by MI. Then, ISPC is introduced as a feature into left-hand and right-hand MI recognition. Main results. ISPC analysis found that left-handed MI can cause a significant decrease in phase synchronization in contralateral sensorimotor SSSEP, while right-handed MI has little effect on it, and vice versa. Combining ISPC features with traditional spectral power features, the single-channel left-hand versus right-hand MI recognition accuracy reaches 81.0%, which is much higher than that observed with traditional MI paradigms (about 60%). Significance. This work shows that the hybrid MI-SSSEP paradigm can provide more sensitive EEG features to decode motor intentions, demonstrating its potential for clinical applications.

Without decreasing accuracy rate of the valence/arousal recognition, the informative component extraction with low computational cost will be examined using multivariate ridge estimation. The advanced TF representation technique called multivariate synchrosqueezing transform (MSST) is used to obtain well-localized components of multi-channel EEG signals. Maximum-energy components in the 2D TF distribution are determined using TF-ridges estimation to extract instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude, respectively. The statistical values of the estimated ridges are used as a feature vector to the inputs of machine learning algorithms. Thus, component information in multi-channel EEG signals can be captured and compressed into low dimensional space for emotion recognition. Mean and variance values of the five maximum-energy ridges in the MSST based TF distribution are adopted as feature vector. Properties of five TF-ridges in frequency and energy plane (e.g., mean frequency, frequency deviation, mean energy, and energy deviation over time) are computed to obtain 20-dimensional feature space. The proposed method is performed on the DEAP emotional EEG recordings for benchmarking, and the recognition rates are yielded up to 71.55, and 70.02% for high/low arousal, and high/low valence, respectively.

To develop an efficient, embedded electroencephalogram (EEG) channel selection approach for deep neural networks, allowing us to match the channel selection to the target model, while avoiding the large computational burdens of wrapper approaches in conjunction with neural networks. Approach. We employ a concrete selector layer to jointly optimize the EEG channel selection and network parameters. This layer uses a Gumbel-softmax trick to build continuous relaxations of the discrete parameters involved in the selection process, allowing them be learned in an end-to-end manner with traditional backpropagation. As the selection layer was often observed to include the same channel twice in a certain selection, we propose a regularization function to mitigate this behavior. We validate this method on two different EEG tasks: motor execution and auditory attention decoding. For each task, we compare the performance of the Gumbel-softmax method with a baseline EEG channel selection approach tailored towards this specific task: mutual information and greedy forward selection with the utility metric respectively. Main results. Our experiments show that the proposed framework is generally applicable, while performing at least as well as (and often better than) these state-of-the-art, task-specific approaches. Significance. The proposed method offers an efficient, task- and model-independent approach to jointly learn the optimal EEG channels along with the neural network weights.

Since all parts of the human body are controlled by the brain, a relationship should exist among brain and skin activities. This study evaluates the relation among skin and brain activities. As such, we benefited from the information-based analysis. We collected GSR and EEG signals of eight participants in various olfactory stimulations. Accordingly, we ran Shannon entropy-based analysis to evaluate the correlation between the information contents of these two signals. The results showed that the alterations in the complexity of stimulus and the information of GSR and EEG signals are strongly correlated. We also verified the results of the analysis of Shannon entropy of signals by calculating their Hurst exponent to quantify their memory. According to the results, the alterations of the memory of EEG and GSR signals are similar to the alterations of the information of these signals.

The scalp or intracranial Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the clinic usually have the character-istics of chaos, nonlinearity, etc. On the one hand, to effectively identify the epileptic signals with these characteristics, two indicators, namely, Sample Entropy (SampEn) and Higuchi's Fractal Dimension (HFD) are selected as features, the most EEG signal segments were classified automatically by using the Sup-port Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and by this method, the recognition accuracy reached 89.8%. On the other hand, because the complexity of some EEG signals is not obvious, it is difficult to identify them by this method, to improve the recognition accuracy of this kind of signals, the method of combining phase space reconstruction (PSR) with Poincare section(PS) is used, and both the epileptic and non-epileptic signals were distinguished to a certain extent, the recognition rate reached more than 90%. The above re-sults can provide theoretical guidance for the recognition or prediction of epileptic EEG signals in clinical practice. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, decoding PAC is still challenging. This contribution presents REPAC, a reliable and robust algorithm for modeling and detecting PAC events in EEG signals. First, we explain the synthesis of PAC-like EEG signals, with special attention to the most critical parameters that characterize PAC, i.e., SNR, modulation index, duration of coupling. Second, REPAC is introduced in detail. We use computer simulations to generate a set of random PAC-like EEG signals and test the performance of REPAC with regard to a baseline method. REPAC is shown to outperform the baseline method even with realistic values of SNR, e.g., dB. They both reach accuracy levels around 99%, but REPAC leads to a significant improvement of sensitivity, from 20.11% to 65.21%, with comparable specificity (around 99%). REPAC is also applied to a real EEG signal showing preliminary encouraging results.

We played six videos in the 2D and 3D modes for nine subjects and calculated the Shannon entropy of recorded EEG signals to investigate how much their embedded information changes between these modes. We also calculated the Hurst exponent of EEG signals to compare the changes in the memory of signals. The analysis results showed that watching the videos in a VR condition causes greater information and memory in EEG signals. A strong correlation was obtained between the increment of information and memory of EEG signals. These increments also have been verified based on the answers that subjects gave to the questions about the content of videos. Therefore, we can say that when subjects watch a video in a VR condition, more information is transferred to their brains that cause increments in their memory.

BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						motor imagery; sensorimotor; EEG rhythm; brain-computer interface; desynchronization; neurorehabilitation; vividness; linear mixed effects; generalized eigendecomposition; open loop	CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; MENTAL PRACTICE; STROKE; RECOVERY	Background. Motor imagery engages much of the same neural circuits as an overt movement. Therefore, the mental rehearsal of movements is often used to supplement physical training and might aid motor neurorehabilitation after stroke. One attempt to capture the brain's involvement in imagery involves the use, as a marker, of the depression or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of thalamocortical sensorimotor rhythms found in a human electroencephalogram (EEG). Using fast real-time processing, it is possible to make the subject aware of their own brain reactions or-even better-to turn them into actions through a technology called the brain-computer interface (BCI). However, it remains unclear whether BCI-enabled imagery facilitates a stronger or qualitatively different brain response compared to the open-loop training. Methods. Seven healthy volunteers who were experienced in both closed and open-loop motor imagery took part in six experimental sessions over a period of 4.5 months, in which they performed kinesthetic imagery of a previously known set of finger and arm movements with simultaneous 30-channel EEG acquisition. The first and the last session mostly consisted of feedback trials in which the subjects were presented with the classification results of the EEG patterns in real time; during the other sessions, no feedback was provided. Spatiotemporal and amplitude features of the ERD patterns concomitant with imagery were compared across experimental days and between feedback conditions using linear mixed-effects modeling. Results. The main spatial sources of ERD appeared to be highly stable across the six experimental days, remaining nearly identical in five of seven subjects (Pearson's rho > 0.94). Only in one subject did the spatial pattern of activation statistically significantly differ (p = 0.009) between the feedback and no-feedback conditions. Real-time visual feedback delivered through the BCI did not significantly increase the ERD strength. Conclusion. The results imply that the potential benefits of MI could be yielded by well-habituated subjects with a simplified open-loop setup, e.g., through at-home self-practice.

There is increasing evidence that abnormal respiratory patterns might contribute to the development and progression of CVD. Consequently, a method that would support a physician in respiratory pattern evaluation should be developed. Group decision-making, tri-way reasoning, and rough set-based analysis were applied to granular computing. Signal attributes and anthropomorphic parameters were explored to develop prediction models to determine the percentage contribution of periodic-like, intermediate, and normal breathing patterns in the analyzed signals. The proposed methodology was validated employing k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and UMAP (uniform manifold approximation and projection). The presented approach applied to respiratory pattern evaluation shows that median accuracies in a considerable number of cases exceeded 0.75. Overall, parameters related to signal analysis are indicated as more important than anthropomorphic features. It was also found that obesity characterized by a high WHR (waist-to-hip ratio) and male sex were predisposing factors for the occurrence of periodic-like or intermediate patterns of respiration.

The ultimate goal is to endow the robot with action recognition capabilities for a more natural social interaction. Summarizing, we apply the CSP algorithm to a set of signals obtained for each video by extracting skeleton joints of the person performing the action. From the transformed signals a summary image is obtained for each video, and these images are then classified using two different approaches; global visual descriptors and convolutional neural networks. The presented approach has been tested on two data sets that represent two scenarios with common characteristics. The first one is a data set with 46 individuals performing 6 different actions. In order to create the group of signals of each video, OpenPose has been used to extract the skeleton joints of the person performing the actions. The second data set is an Argentinian Sign Language data set (LSA64) from which the signs performed using just the right hand have been used. In this case the joint signals have been obtained using MediaPipe. The results obtained with the presented method have been compared with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method, achieving promising results.

Applications of Convolutional Neural Networks in neurodegeneration and physiological aging	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Age group classification; Brain health classification; Convolutional Neural Networks; Functional connectivity; Synchronization Likelihood; Relative Wavelet Entropy	BRAIN AGE; MATURATION; PREDICTION; REGRESSION	The process of aging is linked with significant changes in a human's physiological organization and structure. This is more evident in the case of the brain whose functions generally vary between young and old individuals. Detecting such patterns can be of significant importance especially during the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage which is a transition state before the clinical onset of dementia. Intervening in that stage may delay or eventually prevent dementia onset. In this paper we propose a new methodology based in electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, aiming to classify individuals into healthy, pathological (patients diagnosed with MCI or Mild Dementia) and young, old groups (healthy individuals over and under 50 years of age) through functional connectivity and macro-architecture features. These features are calculated on the estimated brain region activations through the inverse problem solution, enabling us to transform the sensor level EEG recordings through an appropriate transformation matrix. Afterwards, Synchronization Likelihood and Relative Wavelet Entropy values were calculated along with the graph metrics corresponding to the functional connectivity values, as well as the relative energy contributions of five EEG bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma). These features were organized in Red, Green, Blue (RGB) image-like data structures. Therefore, it was possible to classify each individual into one of the two groups per experiment employing Convolutional Neural Networks. From the maximum classification accuracy achieved on the test set, 90.48% for the pathological aging group and 91.19% for the physiological aging, it is evident that the proposed approach is capable of providing adequate health and age group classification.

Automatic estimation of continuous elbow flexion-extension movement based on electromyographic and electroencephalographic signals	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; EMG; LSTM; Elbow joint angle estimation	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; EMG; SIMULATION	The aim of this study was to estimate the elbow joint angle based on EMG and EEG signals using signal processing and machine learning techniques. 21 subjects (ten females, eleven males) performed synchronous flexion-extension movements while EMG, EEG, and elbow kinematic signals were recorded. The EMG and EEG signals were used to estimate the elbow angle employing a long short-term memory neural network. The best results were obtained by training one network per subject (intra subject). The lowest error was reached using the EMG signal, RMSE = 8.59 degrees +/- 2.17 degrees and R-2 = 0.95 with a 95% CI (0.93-0.96). Employing EEG signals generated an RMSE = 9.27 degrees +/- 1.85 degrees and R-2 = 0.95 with a 95% CI (0.94-0.95). When both signals, EMG/EEG, were used, the results were RMSE = 9.53 degrees +/- 2.13 degrees and R-2 = 0.95 with a 95% CI (0.94-0.95). Statistically, for intra-subject data, there is no significant difference in RMSE on using a particular type of signal. In the case of inter-subject data, we obtained the lowest RMSE values considering the combination of EMG/EEG signals, for both, women and men, RMSE = 10.96 degrees +/- 5.28 degrees and RMSE = 9.92 degrees +/- 4.62 degrees, respectively. On the other hand, using subject-wise cross validation, errors increased as expected; however, men's EMG/EEG signals proved to be robust increasing the RMSE only in 3.47 degrees. A new methodology is proposed for estimating elbow angles based on EMG and EEG bio-signals. This can be useful for generating control signals for prostheses and/or exoskeletons designed to provide the support that people with motor disabilities require.

We have approached this issue in the context of online detection of epileptic seizures by developing a DL model from EEG signals, and associating certain properties of the model behavior with the expert medical knowledge. This has conditioned the preparation of the input signals, the network architecture, and the post-processing of the output in line with the domain knowledge. Specifically, we focused the discussion on three main aspects: (1) how to aggregate the classification results on signal segments provided by the DL model into a larger time scale, at the seizure-level; (2) what are the relevant frequency patterns learned in the first convolutional layer of different models, and their relation with the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands on which the visual interpretation of EEG is based; and (3) the identification of the signal waveforms with larger contribution towards the ictal class, according to the activation differences highlighted using the DeepLIFT method. Results show that the kernel size in the first layer determines the interpretability of the extracted features and the sensitivity of the trained models, even though the final performance is very similar after post-processing. Also, we found that amplitude is the main feature leading to an ictal prediction, suggesting that a larger patient population would be required to learn more complex frequency patterns. Still, our methodology was successfully able to generalize patient inter-variability for the majority of the studied population with a classification F1-score of 0.873 and detecting 90% of the seizures.

EEG-based multi-level stress classification with and without smoothing filter	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Stress; Classification; EEG; Signal smoothing; Data leakage	PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; FRAMEWORK; SIGNALS	Recently, multi-level stress assessment has become an active research subject. In this context, researchers typically develop models based on machine learning classifiers and features extracted from biosignals like electrocardiogram (ECG) or electroencephalogram (EEG). For that purpose, EEG power spectral density (PSD) is a recurrent feature owing to its high responsiveness and remarkable performance. However, PSD is usually smoothed to cope with its bursty nature, what may cause data leakage and hence call into question classification performance. In this study, our aim was twofold: first, to examine the effect of EEG-PSD smoothing in three-level stress classification, and second, to evaluate the practical viability of a two-level stress detector without smoothing. To this end, we conducted participants through a stress-relax session while recording their EEG. Then, we estimated the EEG-PSD and used the stress reported by the participants as labels for classification. Initially, we developed a three-level stress classifier and examined the effect of smoothing on its performance. We found that classification performance was directly proportional to smoothing intensity (F1-score 0.61-0.94), and also that when smoothing was not applied to features, classification performance was insufficient for practical applicability (AUC < 0.7). We link this behavior to train-test contamination due to smoothing. Subsequently, we attempted two-level stress classification without smoothing. In this case, performance met the criteria for practical applicability (AUC = 0.76). This suggest that performance enhancement in three-level stress classification was caused by data leakage produced by smoothing, and hence, to render realistic stress classifiers each epoch should be processed individually.

Due to the shortcomings of the conventional polysomnographic acquisition, an automatic sleep scoring method based on a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) is vital in sleep medicine practice. In this study, we proposed a data-driven and robust automatic sleep staging scheme based on a single-channel EEG. With the decomposition of the EEG epochs using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), we extracted various features using statistical, time-domain and nonlinear dynamics characteristics from not only the original EEG signal but also the decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A classification model with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was trained and tested using 5-fold cross-validation on three different databases, i.e., the Sleep-EDF database available at Physionet, the DREAMS Subjects database and the database of Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). The results demonstrated that the analysis of IMFs derived from EEMD could provide substantial supplement to the classification of EEG sleep stages. In the tasks of 4-class and 5-class sleep staging, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 93.1% and 91.9% for the Sleep-EDF database, 86.4% and 83.4% for the DREAMS Subjects database, and 87.5% and 85.8% for the SHHS database, respectively. Furthermore, our observation that prefrontal EEG derivations should be optimal choices might evoke promising application of wearable EEG devices on sleep monitoring because EEG signals can be easily obtained using dry electrodes on the forehead. Additionally, the proposed method is computationally efficient and should be valuable in real-time sleep-scoring. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The underlying neurophysiology is often studied by having observers view pictures varying in affective content. It has been shown that viewing emotionally engaging, compared with neutral, pictures (1) heightens blood flow in limbic, frontoparietal, and anterior visual structures and (2) enhances the late positive event-related potential (LPP). The role of retinotopic visual cortex in this process has, however, been contentious, with competing theories predicting the presence versus absence of emotion-specific signals in retinotopic visual areas. Recording simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging while observers viewed pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral affective pictures, and applying multivariate pattern analysis, we found that (1) unpleasant versus neutral and pleasant versus neutral decoding accuracy were well above chance level in retinotopic visual areas, (2) decoding accuracy in ventral visual cortex (VVC), but not in early or dorsal visual cortex, was correlated with LPP, and (3) effective connectivity from amygdala to VVC predicted unpleasant versus neutral decoding accuracy, whereas effective connectivity from ventral frontal cortex to VVC predicted pleasant versus neutral decoding accuracy. These results suggest that affective scenes evoke valence-specific neural representations in retinotopic visual cortex and that these representations are influenced by reentry signals from anterior brain regions.

However, the nature of the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we therefore used multivariate pattern analyses to directly test the similarities in brain activity among different sleep stages (non-rapid eye movement stages N1-N3, as well as rapid-eye movement sleep REM, and wake). We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (own vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice) salience in 16 healthy sleepers during an 8-h sleep opportunity. Paralinguistic salience (i.e., familiar vs. unfamiliar voice) was reliably decoded from EEG response patterns during both N2 and N3 sleep. Importantly, the classifiers trained on N2 and N3 data generalized to N3 and N2, respectively, suggesting similar processing mode in these states. Moreover, projecting the classifiers' weights using a forward model revealed similar fronto-central topographical patterns in NREM stages N2 and N3. Finally, we found no generalization from wake to any sleep stage (and vice versa) suggesting that "processing modes" or the overall processing architecture with respect to relevant oscillations and/or networks substantially change from wake to sleep. However, the results point to a single and rather uniform NREM-specific mechanism that is involved in (auditory) salience detection during sleep.

Many theories explaining a probable cause for MS have been proposed but the most prominent is the sensory conflict theory, stating that a mismatch between vestibular and visual signals causes MS. Few measurements have been made to understand and quantify the interplay between muscle activation, brain activity, and heart behavior during this condition. We introduce here a novel multimetric system called BioVRSea based on virtual reality (VR), a mechanical platform and several biomedical sensors to study the physiology associated with MS and seasickness. This study reports the results from 28 individuals: the subjects stand on the platform wearing VR goggles, a 64-channel EEG dry-electrode cap, two EMG sensors on the gastrocnemius muscles, and a sensor on the chest that captures the heart rate (HR). The virtual environment shows a boat surrounded by waves whose frequency and amplitude are synchronized with the platform movement. Three measurement protocols are performed by each subject, after each of which they answer the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire. Nineteen parameters are extracted from the biomedical sensors (5 from EEG, 12 from EMG and, 2 from HR) and 13 from the questionnaire. Eight binary indexes are computed to quantify the symptoms combining all of them in the Motion Sickness Index (I-MS). These parameters create the MS database composed of 83 measurements. All indexes undergo univariate statistical analysis, with EMG parameters being most significant, in contrast to EEG parameters. Machine learning (ML) gives good results in the classification of the binary indexes, finding random forest to be the best algorithm (accuracy of 74.7 for I-MS). The feature importance analysis showed that muscle parameters are the most relevant, and for EEG analysis, beta wave results were the most important. The present work serves as the first step in identifying the key physiological factors that differentiate those who suffer from MS from those who do not using the novel BioVRSea system. Coupled with ML, BioVRSea is of value in the evaluation of PC disruptions, which are among the most disturbing and costly health conditions affecting humans.

In this work, we investigate how to extract rhythmic information embedded in the brain responses and to decode the original audio waveforms from the extracted information. A spatiotemporal convolutional neural network is adopted to extract compact rhythm-related representations from the noninvasively measured magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals evoked by listening to rhythmic sounds. These learned MEG representations are then used to condition an audio generator network for the synthesis of the original rhythmic sounds. In the experiments, we evaluated the proposed method by using the MEG signals recorded from eight participants and demonstrated that the generated rhythms are highly related to those evoking the MEG signals. Interestingly, we found that the auditory-related MEG channels reveal high importance in encoding rhythmic representations, the distribution of these representations relate to the timing of beats, and the behavior performance is consistent with the performance of neural decoding. These results suggest that the proposed method can synthesize rhythms by decoding neural representations from MEG.

These interfaces record a user's brain activity and translate it into control commands for external devices, thus providing the PNS with additional artificial outputs. In this framework, the BCIs based on the P300 Event-Related Potentials (ERP), which represent the electrical responses recorded from the brain after specific events or stimuli, have proven to be particularly successful and robust. The presence or the absence of a P300 evoked potential within the EEG features is determined through a classification algorithm. Linear classifiers such as stepwise linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine (SVM) are the most used discriminant algorithms for ERPs' classification. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG signals, multiple stimulation sequences (a.k.a. iterations) are carried out and then averaged before the signals being classified. However, while augmenting the number of iterations improves the Signal-to-Noise Ratio, it also slows down the process. In the early studies, the number of iterations was fixed (no stopping environment), but recently several early stopping strategies have been proposed in the literature to dynamically interrupt the stimulation sequence when a certain criterion is met in order to enhance the communication rate. In this work, we explore how to improve the classification performances in P300 based BCIs by combining optimization and machine learning. First, we propose a new decision function that aims at improving classification performances in terms of accuracy and Information Transfer Rate both in a no stopping and early stopping environment. Then, we propose a new SVM training problem that aims to facilitate the target-detection process. Our approach proves to be effective on several publicly available datasets.

Exploiting Feature Selection and Neural Network Techniques for Identification of Focal and Nonfocal EEG Signals in TQWT Domain	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article							Q WAVELET TRANSFORM; CARDIAC SOUND SIGNALS; FILTER-BANK; AUTOMATED DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; DISCRIMINATION; LOCALIZATION; INDEX	For drug resistance patients, removal of a portion of the brain as a cause of epileptic seizures is a surgical remedy. However, before surgery, the detailed analysis of the epilepsy localization area is an essential and logical step. The Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from these areas are distinct and are referred to as focal, while the EEG signals from other normal areas are known as nonfocal. The visual inspection of multiple channels for detecting the focal EEG signal is time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method based on differential operator and Tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to distinguish the focal and nonfocal signals. For this purpose, first, the EEG signal was differenced and then decomposed by TQWT. Second, several entropy-based features were derived from the TQWT subbands. Third, the efficacy of the six binary feature selection algorithms, binary bat algorithm (BBA), binary differential evolution (BDE) algorithm, firefly algorithm (FA), genetic algorithm (GA), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), was evaluated. In the end, the selected features were fed to several machine learning and neural network classifiers. We observed that the PSO with neural networks provides an effective solution for the application of focal EEG signal detection. The proposed framework resulted in an average classification accuracy of 97.68%, a sensitivity of 97.26%, and a specificity of 98.11% in a tenfold cross-validation strategy, which is higher than the state of the art used in the public Bern-Barcelona EEG database.

But utilization of biosignals that can enhance the overall driving experience is still limited. Microsleep is one such issue that needs intervention, owing to the difficulty in its detection and social acceptance of using wearable BCI devices during transit. Microsleep is a short duration of sleep that lasts from few to several seconds. It could occur unconsciously without the person in context realizing it. This, therefore, happens before the deep sleep and could also occur when performing critical tasks such as driving on a highway. By using modern-day advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning, we can provide efficient solutions to prevent accidents due to microsleep during vehicular transit. However, it is noteworthy that distinguishing microsleep using a single channel system is a challenge. We have explored this using datasets provided by International BCI Competition Committee. Given the fact that the participants' values might not match the exact scenario, approaches for exploiting transitory phases using ANN/CNN have been developed and discussed in this paper. Transitory phases could include Wakefulness <-> Non-Rapid Eye Movement-1 phase (NREM-1). Results show approximate to 95% increase in mean statistical agreements, which are represented by kappa values (CNN NREM1 -> CNN Transition) and approximate to 77% increase in mean kappa (ANN NREM1 -> ANN Transition). Hence, this work gives an initial indication whether classifiers trained on night sleep data can be used for microsleep detection in more real-world scenarios.

A feature depicts an identifiable measurement, a unique property and a functional factor achieved from a section of a pattern. The main features which are extracted are mainly intended to limit the damage of significant data embedded in the signal and are also used to reduce resources required to illustrate a vast set of data precisely. This is important to reduce the expense of data handling, to limit the intricacy of usage and to remove the necessity of compressing the data. Different methods are applied to extract the features from EEG signals; among these methods are Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT), Fuzzy C-means algorithm, Fuzzy Region of Interest Activity (FURIA). Studies have been made on EEG signals because of its capability to produce a method to calculate brain stimulation which is broadly used in brain-computer interface researches with uses in rehabilitation engineering and medical studies. The main objectives of this paper are to discuss some established methods of EEG feature extraction methods, comparing their performances for a particular task and suggesting the most appropriate method for feature extraction based on performance.

Therefore, once the emotional status can be correctly analyzed based on EEG signal, more healthcare-oriented applications can be furtherly carried out. Currently, in order to achieve efficiency and accuracy, diverse amounts of EEG-based emotions recognition methods generally extract features by analyzing the overall characteristics of signal, along with optimization strategy of channel selection to minimize the information redundancy. Those methods have been proved their effectiveness, however, there still remains a big challenge when applied with single channel information for emotion recognition task. Therefore, in order to recognize multidimensional emotions based on single channel information, an emotion quantification analysis (EQA) method is proposed to objectively analyze the semantically similarity between emotions in valence-arousal domains, and a multidimensional emotion recognition (EMER) model is proposed on recognizing multidimensional emotions according to the partial fluctuation pattern (PFP) features based on single channel information, and result shows that even though semantically similar emotions are proved to have similar change patterns in EEG signals, each single channel of 4 frequency bands can efficiently recognize 20 different emotions with an average accuracy above 93% separately.

Recently, some android games are producing negative impacts to the gamers; even in the worst cases the effect is becoming life-threatening too. Most of the existing research works are based on psychological view-point of exploring the impact (positive/negative) of playing android games for the child and adult age-group. However, the online recognition of emotional state changes of the android-gamers while playing video games may be relatively unexplored. To fill this void, the present study proposes a novel method of identifying the emotional state changes of android-gamers by decoding their brain signals and facial images simultaneously during playing video games. Besides above, the second novelty of the paper lies in designing a multimodal fusion method between brain signals and facial images for the said application. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a fused type-2 fuzzy deep neural network (FT2FDNN) which integrates the brain signal processing approach by a general type-2 fuzzy reasoning algorithm with the flavor of the image/video processing approach using a deep convolutional neural network. FT2FDNN uses multiple modalities to extract the similar information (here, emotional changes) simultaneously from the type-2 fuzzy and deep neural representations. The proposed fused type-2 fuzzy deep learning paradigm demonstrates promising results in classifying the emotional changes of gamers with high classification accuracy. Thus the proposed work explores a new era for future researchers.

It is responsible for most of all mental-brain diseases. It does not need any specific reason to happen. It can be experienced from a very little incident to a huge incident. The consequence of it depends on how people handle it. Depression and anxiety are the results of mental stress, and they are the major challenges in today's world. Depression and anxiety are the leading causes of suicide. Most of the time suicidal patients hide their true feelings and fail to communicate their psychiatric problems to physicians. The specific issues that need to be addressed are finding an easy, reliable and realistic way to diagnose mental stress to keep it from becoming a serious and irreversible condition. The primary prevention of mental stress utilizing machine learning algorithms based on reward and punishment processing is important to avoid mental diseases. Several techniques have been used to detect mental stress, and very few papers have tried to detect a patients' comorbidity condition. However, literature shows that there are still chances of further improvement in this field. The traditional methods of detecting mental stress involve a statistical questionnaire approach with some shortcomings as results based on the traditional approach can be biased, which is not possible if Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a method to evaluate the EEG signals on thirty-two individuals for identifying comorbid patients using nine machine learning classifiers based on reward and punishment processing. The performance of our method is also shown to be better than some existing methods.

We present a novel approach to the classification of visual ERPs collected from 6-month-old infants using intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) derived from empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Selected features were used as inputs to two machine learning methods (support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)) using nested cross validation. Different runs were executed for the modelling and classification of the participants in the control and high-risk (HR) groups and the classification of diagnosis outcome within the high-risk group: HR-ASD and HR-noASD. The highest accuracy in the classification of familial risk was 88.44%, achieved using a support vector machine (SVM). A maximum accuracy of 74.00% for classifying infants at risk who go on to develop ASD vs. those who do not was achieved through k-NN. IMF-based extracted features were highly effective in classifying infants by risk status, but less effective by diagnostic outcome. Advanced signal analysis of ERPs integrated with machine learning may be considered a first step toward the development of an early biomarker for ASD.

Therefore, accurate, reliable, and robust epilepsy diagnostic systems is of high importance. The design of such systems involves feature extraction and machine learning (ML) models. Thus, we introduce a novel Self-Similarity Index (SSI) feature based on Hjorth complexity and Katz fractal dimension. SSI is explored individually and in combination with other features extracted from both raw EEG signal and Wavelet Package Decomposition (WPD) coefficients. Several ML models are tested on the Bonn dataset to identify the most suitable model for classifying data into 3 classes - healthy, ictal, and inter-ictal. We show that the proposed SSI is superior to other features when used in a single-feature Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and yields 81.80% accuracy. This result is further improved to 99.00% when SSI is combined with 24 other commonly extracted features. Thus, SSI is a promising feature that allows for high classification accuracy with limited data and number of channels.

J	Liu, TJ; Yang, DL				Liu, Tianjun; Yang, Deling			A Densely Connected Multi-Branch 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Motor Imagery EEG Decoding	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						motor imagery (MI); electroencephalogram (EEG); dense connectivity; 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN)	COMPUTER; FILTER	Motor imagery (MI) is a classical method of brain-computer interaction (BCI), in which electroencephalogram (EEG) signal features evoked by imaginary body movements are recognized, and relevant information is extracted. Recently, various deep-learning methods are being focused on in finding an easy-to-use EEG representation method that can preserve both temporal information and spatial information. To further utilize the spatial and temporal features of EEG signals, an improved 3D representation of the EEG and a densely connected multi-branch 3D convolutional neural network (dense M3D CNN) for MI classification are introduced in this paper. Specifically, as compared to the original 3D representation, a new padding method is proposed to pad the points without electrodes with the mean of all the EEG signals. Based on this new 3D presentation, a densely connected multi-branch 3D CNN with a novel dense connectivity is proposed for extracting the EEG signal features. Experiments were carried out on the WAY-EEG-GAL and BCI competition IV 2a datasets to verify the performance of this proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a state-of-the-art performance that significantly outperforms the multi-branch 3D CNN framework, with a 6.208% improvement in the average accuracy for the BCI competition IV 2a datasets and 6.281% improvement in the average accuracy for the WAY-EEG-GAL datasets, with a smaller standard deviation. The results also prove the effectiveness and robustness of the method, along with validating its use in MI-classification tasks.

It detects P300 signals by combining the outputs from a temporal unit and a spatial unit. The temporal unit is a flexible framework consisting of several temporal modules designed for analyzing brain potential changes in the time domain. The spatial unit combines one-dimensional convolutions (Conv1Ds) and linear layers to generalize P300 features from the space domain, and it can decode EEG signals recorded using different numbers of electrodes. Both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and healthy subjects can benefit from this study. In the within-subject P300 detection and the cross-subject P300 detection, our approach gained higher performance with fewer repeated stimuli than other comparative approaches. Furthermore, we applied the proposed STNN in the P300 detection challenge of BCI Competition III. The accuracy score was 89% in the fifth round of repeated stimuli, outperforming the best result in the literature (accuracy = 80%) to the best of our knowledge. The results demonstrate that the proposed STNN performs well with limited stimuli and is robust enough for various P300 detections. Our model can be found at: https://github.com/Zhangzhenkut/STNN.

J	Jiang, DH; Ma, Y; Wang, YY				Jiang, Dihong; Ma, Yu; Wang, Yuanyuan			A robust two-stage sleep spindle detection approach using single-channel EEG	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						sleep spindle detection; electroencephalogram; Teager energy operator; adaptive parameters; machine learning		Objective. Sleep spindles in the electroencephalogram (EEG) are significant in sleep analysis related to cognitive functions and neurological diseases, and thus are of great clinical interests. An automatic sleep spindle detection algorithm could help decrease the workload of visual inspection by sleep clinicians. Approach. We propose a robust two-stage approach for sleep spindle detection using single-channel EEG. In the pre-detection stage, a stable number of sleep spindle candidates are discovered using the Teager energy operator with adaptive parameters, where the number of true sleep spindles are ensured as many as possible to maximize the detection sensitivity. In the refinement stage, representative features are designed and a bagging classifier is exploited to further recognize the true spindles from all candidates, in order to remove the false detection in the first stage. Main results. Using the union of all experts' annotations as the ground truth, its performance outperforms state-of-the-art works in terms of F1-score (F1) on two public databases (F1: 0.814 for Montreal archive of sleep studies dataset and 0.690 for DREAMS dataset). The annotation consistency between the proposed method and certain selected expert as the trainer could exceed the consistency between two human experts. Significance. The proposed sleep spindle detection method is based on single-channel EEG thus introduces as less interference to the subjects as possible. It is robust to subject variations between databases and is capable of learning certain annotation rules, which is expected to help facilitate the manual labeling of certain experts. In addition, this method is fast enough for real-time applications.

However, the internal dynamics of the two paradigms along with their intrinsic features haven't been revealed. In this paper, we investigated the functional connectivity of the two paradigms, considering various frequency ranges. The dataset of sixteen subjects performing thirteen-class imagined speech and visual imagery were used for the analysis. The phase-locking value of imagined speech and visual imagery was analyzed in seven cortical regions with four frequency ranges. We compared the functional connectivity of imagined speech and visual imagery with the resting state to investigate the brain alterations during the imagery. The phase-locking value in the whole brain region exhibited a significant decrease during both imagined speech and visual imagery. Broca and Wernicke's area along with the auditory cortex mainly exhibited a significant decrease in the imagined speech, and the prefrontal cortex and the auditory cortex have shown a significant decrease in the visual imagery paradigm. Further investigation on the brain connectivity along with the decoding performance of the two paradigms may play a crucial role as a performance predictor.

They have suffered from several limitations. Notably many of these are focused on center-head position to define an area of interest (often referred to as PERCLOS (percentage eye closure)) without considering the face occlusion problem, light illumination, and suffer poor response time. These HDx systems mostly depend on image processing, vision-based, and multisensor-based features. To address these problems, the author utilized vision, sensors, environmental, and vehicular-based features that integrated together by fusion to predict multistage of HDx. Lately, few studies have utilized the combination of multimodal features and deep learning (DL) architectures. Those multimodal-based features (M-HDx) were feasible to predict stages of driver fatigue (multi-stage). However, there is a need to critically measure the performance of these M-HDx by carrying out a comparative analysis to recognize multi-stage of fatigue in terms of hardware-based benchmarks. Moreover, it is important to evaluate the M-HDx systems using different features-set with respect to traditional and advanced machine learning techniques. Therefore, the primary aim of this work is in algorithm and feature modeling, then compare the advantages and differences with other work. In this paper, a different study is conducted compare to state-of-the-art survey articles by statistically measuring the performance. After experiments on M-HDx systems, this paper concludes that there is still a research gap to real-time development of multistage M-HDx systems. In the end, the paper summarizes the directions, challenges, and applications in the development of HDx systems to assist other researchers for further research.

At worst, chronic pain can lead to anxiety and depression. Cost-effective strategies are urgently needed to improve the treatment of pain, and thus we propose a novel home-based pain measurement system for the longitudinal monitoring of pain experience and variation in different patients with chronic low back pain. The autonomous nervous system and audio-visual features are analyzed from heart rate signals, voice characteristics and facial expressions using a unique measurement protocol. Self-reporting is utilized for the follow-up of changes in pain intensity, induced by well-designed physical maneuvers, and for studying the consecutive trends in pain. We describe the study protocol, including hospital measurements and questionnaires and the implementation of the home measurement devices. We also present different methods for analyzing the multimodal data: electroencephalography, audio, video and heart rate. Our intention is to provide new insights using technical methodologies that will be beneficial in the future not only for patients with low back pain but also patients suffering from any chronic pain.

Several deep learning models have been proposed to classify EEG signals in patients with various neurological diseases. However, no effective deep learning model for eventrelated potential (ERP) signal classification is yet available for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Method: This study proposed a single-scale multi-input convolutional neural network (SSMICNN) method to classify ERP signals between aMCI patients with T2DM and the control group. Firstly, the 18-electrode ERP signal on alpha, beta, and theta frequency bands was extracted by using the fast Fourier transform, and then the mean, sum of squares, and absolute value feature of each frequency band were calculated. Finally, these three features are converted into multispectral images respectively and used as the input of the SSMICNN network to realize the classification task. Results: The results show that the SSMICNN can fuse MSI formed by different features, SSMICNN enriches the feature quantity of the neural network input layer and has excellent robustness, and the errors of SSMICNN can be simultaneously transmitted to the three convolution channels in the back-propagation phase. Comparison with Existing Method(s): SSMICNN could more effectively identify ERP signals from aMCI with T2DM from the control group compared to existing classification methods, including convolution neural network, support vector machine, and logistic regression. Conclusions: The combination of SSMICNN and MSI can be used as an effective biological marker to distinguish aMCI patients with T2DM from the control group.

For examples, distracted students can be suggested to do a brief exercise to refresh their brains; or the teacher can be notified when too many students have difficulties on concentration so the class could take a short break. Traditionally, mental states like concentration levels can be analyzed using Electroencephalogram (EEG) or Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, methods that utilize these data require specialized equipment which is not feasible to deploy on a large scale. On the other hand, recent breakthroughs in deep learning provide possibilities of scalable solutions to detect concentration levels using only webcam. Leveraging this advancement, we investigate the task of tracking students' concentration levels during online learning using facial data coupled with deep learning based computer vision technologies. More specifically, we examine the performances of different representations of facial data integrated with various deep architectures to empirically determine a solution balanced between prediction accuracy and time efficiency that is suitable for real-time application. Our experimental study shows that the proposed solution achieves over 91% accuracy while keeping execution time low enough for real-time deployment.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) offer an intuitive means to control such assistive robotic manipulators. However, BCI performance may vary due to the non-stationary nature of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. It, hence, cannot be used safely for controlling tasks where errors may be detrimental to the user. Avoiding obstacles is one such task. As there exist many techniques to avoid obstacles in robotics, we propose to give the control to the robot to avoid obstacles and to leave to the user the choice of the robot behavior to do so a matter of personal preference as some users may be more daring while others more careful. We enable the users to train the robot controller to adapt its way to approach obstacles relying on BCI that detects error-related potentials (ErrP), indicative of the user's error expectation of the robot's current strategy to meet their preferences. Gaussian process-based inverse reinforcement learning, in combination with the ErrP-BCI, infers the user's preference and updates the obstacle avoidance controller so as to generate personalized robot trajectories. We validate the approach in experiments with thirteen able-bodied subjects using a robotic arm that picks up, places and avoids real-life objects. Results show that the algorithm can learn user's preference and adapt the robot behavior rapidly using less than five demonstrations not necessarily optimal. Teaching an assistive robotic manipulator to move objects in a cluttered table requires demonstrations from expert operators, but what if the experts are individuals with motor disabilities? Batzianoulis et al. propose a learning approach which combines robot autonomy and a brain-computer interfacing that decodes whether the generated trajectories meet the user's criteria, and show how their system enables the robot to learn individual user's preferred behaviors using less than five demonstrations that are not necessarily optimal.

Even in healthy individuals, taste perceptions often drive dietary decisions more strongly than healthiness. This study tested whether health and taste representations can be directly decoded from brain activity, both when explicitly considered, and when implicitly processed for decision-making. We used multivariate support vector regression for event-related potentials (as measured by the electroencephalogram) to estimate a regression model predicting ratings of tastiness and healthiness for each participant, based on their neural activity occurring in the first second of food cue processing. In Experiment 1, 37 healthy participants viewed images of various foods and explicitly rated their tastiness and healthiness. In Experiment 2, 89 healthy participants completed a similar rating task, followed by an additional experimental phase, in which they indicated their desire to consume snack foods with no explicit instruction to consider tastiness or healthiness. In Experiment 1 both attributes could be decoded, with taste information being available earlier than health. In Experiment 2, both dimensions were also decodable, and their significant decoding preceded the decoding of decisions (i.e., desire to consume the food). However, in Experiment 2, health representations were decodable earlier than taste representations. These results suggest that health information is activated in the brain during the early stages of dietary decisions, which is promising for designing obesity interventions aimed at quickly activating health awareness.

Passenger-driver behavior from psychological processes can provide insight into the trust levels of the dyad dynamic during an open-road drive. Measuring passenger trust can benefit in speeding up the adoption of self-driving cars. This area has not been fully explored from the passenger's point of view and can yield results that could potentially propel the progress of driver safety systems in autonomous driving. A novel approach to correlating the passenger-driver trust levels can be elicited from brain-based indicators that are extracted from time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that capture both sensory and cognitive processes. In this paper, we propose a trust identification technique utilizing evoked response potential (ERP) events such as P300 along with beta/alpha frequency ratios from specific passengers during braking, aggressive acceleration, and lane changing scenarios. The results obtained from the decomposition of these EEG signals into the frequency bands and application of machine learning techniques on data collected from frontal and parietal electrodes during these driving events prove the feasibility of this study. By examining additional passenger-driver pairs with varying social interaction and trust profiles in the future, we can strengthen the existence of a cognitive correlation between passenger-driver behavior and thus improve the efficiency of driver safety systems.

Sai-Nam-Phueng essential oil	BIOMEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Citrus reticulata; Sai-Nam-Phueng; Essential oil; GC/MS; EEG; REM sleep	RAT EEG; DIAZEPAM; INHALATION; BERGAMOT; RECEPTOR; POWER; CLASSIFICATION; ANTIOXIDANT; FLUOXETINE; EXTRACTS	Background: Citrus essential oil (EO) has been used for mood elevation and sedative hypnotic purposes. However, scientific proofs of its central nervous system (CNS) action remained largely unexplored. This study investigated chemotypes, electrical brain waves and sleep-wake effects of the essential oil from Citrus reticulata in rat model. Methods: Chemical contents of citrus EO were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Male Wistar rats implanted with electrodes on the frontal and parietal skulls were used for electroencephalographic (EEG) recording while inhaling the citrus EO (200 ml on cotton wool). Diazepam (10 mg/kg, p.o.) was used as a standard anxiolytic drug. EEG frequency analyses were performed by using Fast Fourier transform. All data were statistical analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results: GC-MS analysis revealed D-limonene (95.7%) as a major constituent of citrus EO. The EEG results showed that overall EEG patterns of citrus EO effects were relatively similar to that of diazepam. However, significant differences between treatments were seen from sleep-wake analyses. Diazepam significantly increased episode numbers of awake and non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduced averaged episode duration. On the other hand, the citrus EO significantly decreased REM sleep latency and increased total time and episode numbers of REM sleep. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated unique CNS effects of C. reticulata EO with EEG fingerprints and sleep-wake profiles. The data might be useful for citrus essential oil subclassification and clinical application.

The aim of our study was to characterize epilepsy phenotypes and electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns in AGS and look for possible correlations with clinical, genetic and neuroradiological features. Methods: We selected patients with an established AGS diagnosis followed at three Italian reference centers. Medical records, EEGs and MRI/CT findings were reviewed. EEGs were independently and blindly reviewed by three board-certified pediatric epileptologists. Chi square and Fisher?s exact tests were used to test associations between epilepsy and EEG feature categories and clinical, radiological and genetic variables. Results: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. We reviewed 63 EEGs and at least one brain MRI scan per patient. Epilepsy, mainly in the form of epileptic spasms and focal seizures, was present in 37 % of the cohort; mean age at epilepsy onset was 9.5 months (range 1?36). The presence of epilepsy was associated with calcification severity (p = 0.016) and startle reactions (p = 0.05). Organization of EEG electrical activity appeared to be disrupted or markedly disrupted in 73 % of cases. Severe EEG disorganization correlated with microcephaly (p < 0.001) and highly abnormal MRI T2-weighted signal intensity in white matter (p = 0.022). Physiological organization of the EEG was found to be better preserved during sleep (87 %) than wakefulness (38 %). Focal slow activity was recorded in more than one third of cases. Fast activity, either diffuse or with frontal location, was more frequent in the awake state (78 %) than in sleep (50 %). Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were present in 33 % of awake and 45 % of sleep recordings. IEDs during sleep were associated with a higher risk of a epileptic seizures (p = 0.008). Significance: The hallmarks of EEG recordings in AGS were found to be: disruption of electrical organization, the presence of focal slow and fast activity, and the presence of IEDs, both in patients with and in those without epilepsy. The associations between epilepsy and calcification and between EEG pattern and the finding of a highly abnormal white matter T2 signal intensity suggest a common anatomical correlate. However, the complex anatomical-electroclinical basis of AGS-related epilepsy still requires further elucidation.

Electroencephalogram is often used clinically to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. The spikes and sharps contain a large amount of epilepsy-related pathological information, so the detection of spikes and sharps among the abnormal epileptic waveforms has more clinical diagnostic value. There are two problems in using machine learning to achieve automatic recognition of spike and sharp waves. One is that most of the EEG data are unlabeled data, and it is difficult to obtain a large number of labeled training sets; the other is that spikes and sharps are mixed with plenty of background waves, which lead to a data imbalance trouble.Based on the above backdrop, this paper implements a detection framework of epileptiform spikes using active learning in order to achieve better recognition results with as little cost as possible, and its major contributions are as follows: (1)The KNN attention layer is introduced in the learning engine to improve the generalization ability of the model in the case of few samples; (2)In terms of the sampling engine, MPGR (Manifold Preserving Graph Reduction) pre-processing is first performed to initially reduce the imbalance rate of the data and remove redundant points, then density-weighted uncertainty based on GAN is used to accelerate the efficiency of active learning, and finally boundary distance-based clustering sampling is used, which is to ensure diversity while taking balanced samples as much as possible. Results of experiments conducted on a hospital-supplied dataset show that the proposed framework is effective.

By incorporating ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)-based "keyword spotting" or "wake up commands", we provide techniques for assessing when a BCI should start decoding, improving accuracy and efficiency for end users. Here, we use high density scalp EEG collected while participants listened to continuous speech in an audio-only, clear context, or while they watched highly noisy, naturalistic audiovisual movie clips. We designed three speech processing deep learning models: A sentence spotter (SS) model, Phoneme vs. Silence (PS) classifier and finally, Audio vs. Audio-visual (AV) stimuli induced EEG response classifier. The overall goal of this study is to design and examine the performance of these techniques for various speech processing applications. We use Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) neural network architectures and evaluated them on 16 participants' EEG data. We show 98.15% accuracy for our AV classifier, 98.56 F1 score on SS model and 70.33 F1 score on the PS model.(1)	[Sakthi, Madhumitha; Tewfik, Ahmed] Univ Texas Austin, Dept ECE, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Desai, Maansi; Hamilton, Liberty] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Speech Language & Hearing Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hamilton, Liberty] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Neurol, Austin, TX 78712 USA		Sakthi, M (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept ECE, Austin, TX 78712 USA.	madhumithasakthi.iyer@utexas.edu; maansi.desai@utexas.edu; liberty.hamilton@austin.utexas.edu; tewfik@austin.utexas.edu			Texas Speech-Language Hearing Foundation Elizabeth Wiig doctoral fellowship; Tina E.

Though the brain plasticity across modalities during deafness is associated with individual CI outcomes, longitudinal observations in multiple patients are scarce. Therefore, we sought a prediction system based on cross-modal plasticity in a longitudinal study with multiple patients. METHODS: Classification of CI outcomes between excellent or poor was tested based on the features of brain cross-modal plasticity, measured using event-related responses and their corresponding electromagnetic sources. A machine learning estimation model was applied to 13 datasets from 3 patients based on linear supervised training. Classification efficiency was evaluated comparing prediction accuracy, sensitivity/specificity, total mis- classification cost, and training time among feature set conditions. RESULTS: Combined feature sets with the sensor and source levels dramatically improved classification accuracy between excellent and poor outcomes. Specifically, the tactile feature set best explained CI outcome (accuracy, 98.83 +/- 2.57%; sensitivity, 98.00 +/- 0.01%; specificity, 98.15 +/- 4.26%; total misclassification cost, 0.17 +/- 0.38; training time, 0.51 +/- 0.09 sec), followed by the visual feature (accuracy, 93.50 +/- 4.89%; sensitivity, 89.17 +/- 8.16%; specificity, 98.00 +/- 0.01%; total misclassification cost, 0.65 +/- 0.49; training time, 0.38 +/- 0.50 sec). CONCLUSION: Individual tactile and visual processing in the brain best classified the current status when classified by combined sensor-source level features. Our results suggest that cross-modal brain plasticity due to deafness may provide a basis for classifying the status. We expect this novel method to contribute to the evaluation and prediction of CI outcomes.

Recent research indicates that gender, age and identity of faces can be decoded from EEG/MEG data within 100 ms. Yet, the time course and neural circuitry involved in representing the personal relevance of faces remain unknown. We applied simultaneous EEG-fMRI to examine neural responses to emotional faces of female participants' romantic partners, friends, and a stranger. Combining EEG and fMRI in cross-modal representational similarity analyses, we provide evidence that representations of personal relevance start prior to structural encoding at 100 ms, with correlated representations in visual cortex, but also in prefrontal and midline regions involved in value representation, and monitoring and recall of self-relevant information. Our results add to an emerging body of research that suggests that models of face perception need to be updated to account for rapid detection of personal relevance in cortical circuitry beyond the core face processing network.

The subsequent evaluation of the obtained records is very time-consuming. The goal of this study was to create an automatic system for evaluation of the airflow and SpO(2) channels of polysomnography records, through the use of machine learning techniques and a large database, for apnea and desaturation detection (which is unusual in other studies). To that end, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed using hyperparameter optimization. It was then trained and tested for apnea and desaturation. The proposed CNN was compared with the commonly used k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method. The classifiers were designed based on nasal airflow and blood oxygen saturation signals. The final neural network accuracy for apnea detection reached 84%, and that for desaturation detection was 74%, while the k-NN classifier reached accuracies of 83% and 64% for apnea detection and desaturation detection, respectively.

Methods Three hundred sixty-six patients visiting our memory clinic underwent MEG recording. Source-reconstructed MEG data were visually assessed and evaluated in the context of clinical findings and other diagnostic markers. We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of MEG spectral measures in the discrimination of individual AD dementia patients (n = 40) from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) patients (n = 40) using random forest models. Results Best discrimination was obtained using a combination of relative theta and delta power (accuracy 0.846, sensitivity 0.855, specificity 0.837). The results were validated in an independent cohort. Hippocampal and thalamic regions, besides temporal-occipital lobes, contributed considerably to the model. Discussion MEG has been implemented successfully in the workup of memory clinic patients and has value in diagnostic decision-making.

However, extraction of the features from non-linear and non-stationary EEG signals is still a challenging task in current algorithms. With the development of artificial intelligence, various advanced algorithms have been proposed for signal classification in recent years. Among them, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the most attractive type of method due to their end-to-end structure and powerful ability of automatic feature extraction. However, it is difficult to collect large-scale datasets in practical applications of BCIs, which may lead to overfitting or weak generalizability of the classifier. To address these issues, a promising technique has been proposed to improve the performance of the decoding model based on data augmentation (DA). In this article, we investigate recent studies and development of various DA strategies for EEG classification based on DNNs. The review consists of three parts: what kind of paradigms of EEG-based on BCIs are used, what types of DA methods are adopted to improve the DNN models, and what kind of accuracy can be obtained. Our survey summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes that aim to promote or guide the deployment of DA to EEG classification in future research and development.

In order to correctly implement these types of BCI, we must be able to detect from a continuous signal, when the subject starts to imagine words. In this work, five methods of feature extraction based on wavelet decomposition, empirical mode decomposition, frequency energies, fractal dimension and chaos theory features are presented to solve the task of detecting imagined words segments from continuous EEG signals as a preliminary study for a latter implementation of an asynchronous BCI based on imagined speech. These methods are tested in three datasets using four different classifiers and the higher F(1)scores obtained are 0.73, 0.79, and 0.68 for each dataset, respectively. This results are promising to build a system that automatizes the segmentation of imagined words segments for latter classification.

The N2pc is a small amplitude transient interhemispheric voltage asymmetry used in cognitive neuroscience to investigate subject's allocation of selective visuo-spatial attention. N2pc is typically estimated by averaging the sweeps of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal but, in absence of explicit normative indications, the number of sweeps is often based on arbitrariness or personal experience. With the final aim of reducing duration and cost of experimental protocols, here we developed a new approach to reliably predict N2pc amplitude from a minimal EEG dataset. Approach. First, features predictive of N2pc amplitude were identified in the time-frequency domain. Then, an artificial neural network (NN) was trained to predict N2pc mean amplitude at the individual level. By resorting to simulated data, accuracy of the NN was assessed by computing the mean squared error (MSE) and the amplitude discretization error (ADE) and compared to the standard time averaging (TA) technique. The NN was then tested against two real datasets consisting of 14 and 12 subjects, respectively. Main result. In simulated scenarios entailing different number of sweeps (between 10 and 100), the MSE obtained with the proposed method resulted, on average, 1/5 of that obtained with the TA technique. Implementation on real EEG datasets showed that N2pc amplitude could be reliably predicted with as few as 40 EEG sweeps per cell of the experimental design. Significance. The developed approach allows to reduce duration and cost of experiments involving the N2pc, for instance in studies investigating attention deficits in pathological subjects.

This study aims to establish a generalized transfer-learning framework for boosting the performance of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) by leveraging cross-domain data transferring. Approach. We enhanced the state-of-the-art template-based SSVEP decoding through incorporating a least-squares transformation (LST)-based transfer learning to leverage calibration data across multiple domains (sessions, subjects, and electroencephalogram montages). Main results. Study results verified the efficacy of LST in obviating the variability of SSVEPs when transferring existing data across domains. Furthermore, the LST-based method achieved significantly higher SSVEP-decoding accuracy than the standard task-related component analysis (TRCA)-based method and the non-LST naive transfer-learning method. Significance. This study demonstrated the capability of the LST-based transfer learning to leverage existing data across subjects and/or devices with an in-depth investigation of its rationale and behavior in various circumstances. The proposed framework significantly improved the SSVEP decoding accuracy over the standard TRCA approach when calibration data are limited. Its performance in calibration reduction could facilitate plug-and-play SSVEP-based BCIs and further practical applications.

The journal of Economic and Environmental Geology (EEG) has a long history of over 52 years and published interdisciplinary articles based on geology. In this study, we performed a literature review using topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine learning model, to identify geological topics, historical trends (classic topics and emerging topics), and association by analyzing titles, keywords, and abstracts of 2,571 publications in EEG during 1968-2020. The results showed that 8 topics ('petrology and geochemistry', 'hydrology and hydrogeology', 'economic geology', 'volcanology', 'soil contaminant and remediation', 'general and structural geology', 'geophysics and geophysical exploration', and 'clay mineral') were identified in the EEG. Before 1994, classic topics ('economic geology', 'volcanology', and 'general and structure geology') were dominant research trends. After 1994, emerging topics ('hydrology and hydrogeology', 'soil contaminant and remediation', 'clay mineral') have arisen, and its portion has gradually increased. The result of association analysis showed that EEG tends to be more comprehensive based on 'economic geology'. Our results provide understanding of how geological research topics branch out and merge with other fields using a useful literature review tool for geological research in South Korea.

J	Phan, TDT; Kim, SH; Yang, HJ; Lee, GS				Phan, Tran-Dac-Thinh; Kim, Soo-Hyung; Yang, Hyung-Jeong; Lee, Guee-Sang			EEG-Based Emotion Recognition by Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Scale Kernels	SENSORS			English	Article						emotion recognition; electroencephalogram; EEG signals; channel correlation; frequency band correlation; multiscale kernel	FUSION	Besides facial or gesture-based emotion recognition, Electroencephalogram (EEG) data have been drawing attention thanks to their capability in countering the effect of deceptive external expressions of humans, like faces or speeches. Emotion recognition based on EEG signals heavily relies on the features and their delineation, which requires the selection of feature categories converted from the raw signals and types of expressions that could display the intrinsic properties of an individual signal or a group of them. Moreover, the correlation or interaction among channels and frequency bands also contain crucial information for emotional state prediction, and it is commonly disregarded in conventional approaches. Therefore, in our method, the correlation between 32 channels and frequency bands were put into use to enhance the emotion prediction performance. The extracted features chosen from the time domain were arranged into feature-homogeneous matrices, with their positions following the corresponding electrodes placed on the scalp. Based on this 3D representation of EEG signals, the model must have the ability to learn the local and global patterns that describe the short and long-range relations of EEG channels, along with the embedded features. To deal with this problem, we proposed the 2D CNN with different kernel-size of convolutional layers assembled into a convolution block, combining features that were distributed in small and large regions.

Recurrence quantification analysis provides the link between age-related decline in motor brain response and complexity of the baseline EEG	IZVESTIYA VYSSHIKH UCHEBNYKH ZAVEDENIY-PRIKLADNAYA NELINEYNAYA DINAMIKA			English	Article						complexity; recurrence quantification analysis; EEG; age-related changes; event-related desynchronization	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SAMPLE ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; DIMENSION; PATTERNS; MEG	The goal of the present study is to investigate the effect of healthy aging on the neuronal mechanisms supporting human brain activity during motor task performance. Such biomarkers of the age-related changes can be detected using mathematical methods of time-series analysis and complexity analysis. Methods. In the present paper, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) measures are employed to explore the complexity of the pre-movement EEG in young and elderly adult groups. To evaluate the neural brain response during motor execution, we applied the traditional methods of time-frequency analysis. Results. The proposed approach demonstrated that (i) the RQA measures show a significant increase of complexity in elderly adults; (ii) increased pre-movement EEG complexity comes with the reduced motor-related brain response in the a/m-band (p < 0.01), estimated via the traditional methods of time-frequency analysis. It allows to conclude that the increased pre-movement EEG complexity indicates the weak neuronal plasticity degenerated under the factor of age. Conclusion. The complexity of the pre-movement a/m-band neuronal oscillations could be considered as a relevant measure for the detection of age-related cognitive or motor impairments. Besides, applied RQA method demonstrated a good ability to assess the complexity features of pre-stimulus EEG and provided a clear interpretation of age-related changes in electrical activity of the brain cortex.

Critical and Ictal Phases in Simulated EEG Signals on a Small-World Network	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						epilepsy; epileptic seizures; epileptogensis; small-world networks; simulation-computers; neuron; criticality; phase transition	EPILEPSY	Healthy brain function is marked by neuronal network dynamics at or near the critical phase, which separates regimes of instability and stasis. A failure to remain at this critical point can lead to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, which is associated with pathological synchronization of neuronal oscillations. Using full Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) simulations on a Small-World Network, we are able to generate synthetic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with intervals corresponding to seizure (ictal) or non-seizure (interictal) states that can occur based on the hyperexcitability of the artificial neurons and the strength and topology of the synaptic connections between them. These interictal simulations can be further classified into scale-free critical phases and disjoint subcritical exponential phases. By changing the HH parameters, we can model seizures due to a variety of causes, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), congenital channelopathies, and idiopathic etiologies, as well as the effects of anticonvulsant drugs. The results of this work may be used to help identify parameters from actual patient EEG or electrocorticographic (ECoG) data associated with ictogenesis, as well as generating simulated data for training machine-learning seizure prediction algorithms.

This present work classifies six emotions (anger, sadness, happiness, fear, disgust, and surprise) of two types of stroke (left brain damage and right brain-damage) using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG signals are collected from 19 each subject of LBD, RBD, and normal control (NC) at a sampling rate of 128 Hz. The IIR Bandpass filter and amplitude thresholding methods are used to reduce noise and artifacts' effects, respectively. Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform is used to extract five EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta, gamma, alpha to gamma, and beta to gamma). A set of nonlinear features are extracted from five different EEG frequency ranges using recurrent quantification analysis. Finally, the extracted features are mapped to six corresponding emotions using three nonlinear classifiers (K nearest neighbor, probabilistic neural network, and random forest). The experimental results indicate that LBD subjects have severe emotional impairment than RBD. The mean of diagonal line length (< L >), recurrence rate, and maximum mean diagonal length (L-max) feature give maximum classification rate of 85.24% NC, 79.54%, and 79.09% using RF classifier compared to other features. The alpha to gamma (13-49 Hz) band helps identify Stroke emotional state changes compared to other frequency bands.

By analyzing and exploring these signals, we can identify which state the system is in and understand the underlying dynamics of that system. Numerous linear and nonlinear methods have been developed for analyzing physiological signals, but they either rely on certain assumptions or are easily affected by various factors, which limits their applications. In this paper, we propose a novel dissimilarity measure between two signals, which is based on the ordinal pattern representation of signals. Therefore, it naturally inherits the advantages of ordinal pattern analysis, namely simplicity, robustness, and low complexity in computation without further prior assumptions. Finally, we apply this new measure to analyze several physiological signals derived from different physiological and pathological conditions to assess the effectiveness of the proposed measure. Experimental results from heart rate analysis, EEG signals analysis of healthy subjects and patients with epilepsy, and analysis of EEG signals at different sleep stages in healthy subjects demonstrate that the new measure is capable of distinguishing signals from different conditions and is therefore a useful tool for analyzing various physiological signals.

It is characterized by the integration of massive digital information through the interconnection of machines and processes in order to make decisions in real-time. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is having and will have a great impact on different aspects, such as business, governments, and people. The impact on education is our main concern in this work because global challenges are leading us to prepare our students for jobs that have yet to be invented. For this purpose, several competencies are required to be developed in our students. One of them is critical thinking (CT). The development of this competency has been present in the educational agenda of many countries. In this paper, we proposed that CT as a construct can be measured using brainwaves from a portable electroencephalograph (EEG) during a problem-based learning (PBL) exercise. In this work, a method was designed to acquire, process, and analyze EEG brain waves in order to identify CT occurrence. Some results are shown from these analyses, and a discussion is provided about significant differences within the critical thinking of undergraduate students taking a course in Integral Calculus.

J	Li, MA; Han, JF; Yang, JF				Li, Ming-ai; Han, Jian-fu; Yang, Jin-fu			Automatic feature extraction and fusion recognition of motor imagery EEG using multilevel multiscale CNN	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Convolutional neural network; Wavelet transform; MI-EEG imaging method; Machine learning	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS; TASKS	A motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) signal is often selected as the driving signal in an active brain computer interface (BCI) system, and it has been a popular field to recognize MI-EEG images via convolutional neural network (CNN), which poses a potential problem for maintaining the integrity of the time-frequency-space information in MI-EEG images and exploring the feature fusion mechanism in the CNN. However, information is excessively compressed in the present MI-EEG image, and the sequential CNN is unfavorable for the comprehensive utilization of local features. In this paper, a multidimensional MI-EEG imaging method is proposed, which is based on time-frequency analysis and the Clough-Tocher (CT) interpolation algorithm. The time-frequency matrix of each electrode is generated via continuous wavelet transform (WT), and the relevant section of frequency is extracted and divided into nine submatrices, the longitudinal sums and lengths of which are calculated along the directions of frequency and time successively to produce a 3 x 3 feature matrix for each electrode. Then, feature matrix of each electrode is interpolated to coincide with their corresponding coordinates, thereby yielding a WT-based multidimensional image, called WTMI. Meanwhile, a multilevel and multiscale feature fusion convolutional neural network (MLMSFFCNN) is designed for WTMI, which has dense information, low signal-to-noise ratio, and strong spatial distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, and accuracies of 92.95% and 97.03% are yielded based on 10-fold cross-validation, respectively, which exceed those of the state-of-the-art imaging methods. The kappa values and p values demonstrate that our method has lower class skew and error costs. The experimental results demonstrate that WTMI can fully represent the time-frequency-space features of MI-EEG and that MLMSFFCNN is beneficial for improving the collection of multiscale features and the fusion recognition of general and abstract features for WTMI.

This article presents the development of a real-time locomotion system of a hexapod robot with bio-inspired movement dynamics inspired in the stick insect and tele-operated by cognitive activities of motor imagination. Brain signals are acquired using only four electrodes from a BCI device and sent to computer equipment for processing and classification by the iQSA method based on quaternion algebra. A structure consisting of three main stages are proposed: (1) signal acquisition, (2) data analysis and processing by the iQSA method, and (3) bio-inspired locomotion system using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) with twelve neurons. An off-line training stage was carried out with data from 120 users to create the necessary decision rules for the iQSA method, obtaining an average performance of 97.72%. Finally, the experiment was implemented in real-time to evaluate the performance of the entire system. The recognition rate to achieve the corresponding gait pattern is greater than 90% for BCI, and the time delay is approximately from 1 to 1.5 seconds. The results show that all the subjects could generate their desired mental activities, and the robotic system could replicate the gait pattern in line with a slight delay.

Methods: We analyzed long-term EEGs from 76 patients with at least one recorded epileptic seizure during monitoring. IEDs were detected with an AI-based algorithm and validated by visual inspection. We then used unsupervised clustering to characterize patient sub-cohorts with similar IED activation patterns regarding circadian rhythms, deep sleep activation, and seizure occurrence. Results: Five sub-cohorts with similar IED activation patterns were found: "Sporadic" (14%, n = 10) without or few IEDs, "Continuous" (32%, n = 23) with weak circadian/deep sleep or seizure modulation, "Nighttime & seizure activation" (23%, n = 17) with high IED rates during normal sleep times and after seizures but without deep sleep modulation, "Deep sleep" (19%, n = 14) with strong IED modulation during deep sleep, and "Seizure deactivation" (12%, n = 9) with deactivation of IEDs after seizures. Patients showing "Deep sleep" IED pattern were diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy in 86%, while 80% of the "Sporadic" cluster were extratemporal. Conclusions: Patients with epilepsy can be characterized by using temporal relationships between rates of IEDs, circadian rhythms, deep sleep and seizures.

J	Lekova, A; Chavdarov, I				Lekova, Anna; Chavdarov, Ivan			A Fuzzy Shell for Developing an Interpretable BCI Based on the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Evoked Oscillations	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; WORKING-MEMORY LOAD; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; ALPHA BAND; ATTENTION; THETA; CORRELATE	Researchers in neuroscience computing experience difficulties when they try to carry out neuroanalysis in practice or when they need to design an explainable brain-computer interface (BCI) with quick setup and minimal training phase. There is a need of interpretable computational intelligence techniques and new brain states decoding for more understandable interpretation of the sensory, cognitive, and motor brain processing. We propose a general-purpose fuzzy software system shell for developing a custom EEG BCI system. It relies on the bursts of the ongoing EEG frequency power synchronization/desynchronization at scalp level and supports quick BCI setup by linguistic features, ad hoc fuzzy membership construction, explainable IF-THEN rules, and the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), which makes the BCI system device and service independent. It has a potential for designing both passive and event-related BCIs with options for visual representation at scalp-source level in response to time. The feasibility of the proposed system has been proven by real experiments and bursts for beta and gamma frequency power have been detected in real time in response to evoked visuospatial selective attention. The presence of the proposed new brain state decoding can be used as a feasible metric for interpretation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the passive or evoked neural oscillations.

J	Lun, XM; Yu, ZL; Wang, F; Chen, T; Hou, YM				Lun, Xiangmin; Yu, Zhenglin; Wang, Fang; Chen, Tao; Hou, Yimin			A novel approach of CNN for human motor imagery recognition using the virtual electrode pairs	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; motor imagery; convolutional neural network	CLASSIFICATION	In order to develop an efficient brain-computer interface system, the brain activity measured by electroencephalography needs to be accurately decoded. In this paper, a motor imagery classification approach is proposed, combining virtual electrodes on the cortex layer with a convolutional neural network; this can effectively improve the decoding performance of the brain-computer interface system. A three layer (cortex, skull, and scalp) head volume conduction model was established by using the symmetric boundary element method to map the scalp signal to the cortex area. Nine pairs of virtual electrodes were created on the cortex layer, and the features of the time and frequency sequence from the virtual electrodes were extracted by performing time-frequency analysis. Finally, the convolutional neural network was used to classify motor imagery tasks. The results show that the proposed approach is convergent in both the training model and the test model. Based on the Physionet motor imagery database, the averaged accuracy can reach 98.32% for a single subject, while the averaged values of accuracy, Kappa, precision, recall, and F1-score on the group-wise are 96.23%, 94.83%, 96.21%, 96.13%, and 96.14%, respectively. Based on the High Gamma database, the averaged accuracy has achieved 96.37% and 91.21% at the subject and group levels, respectively. Moreover, this approach is superior to those of other studies on the same database, which suggests robustness and adaptability to individual variability.

Methods Retrospective analysis of patients with PD identified 36 PD-MCI and 35 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC). QEEG features of power spectrum and structural MR features of cortex based on surface-based morphometry (SBM) were extracted. Support vector machine (SVM) was established using combined features of structural MR and qEEG to identify PD-MCI. Feature importance evaluation algorithm of mean impact value (MIV) was established to sort the vital characteristics of qEEG and structural MR. Results Compared with PD-NC, PD-MCI showed a statistically significant difference in 5 leads and waves of qEEG and 7 cortical region features of structural MR. The SVM model based on these qEEG and structural MR features yielded an accuracy of 0.80 in the training set and had a high prediction accuracy of 0.80 in the test set (sensitivity was 0.78, specificity was 0.83, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.77), which was higher than the model built by the feature separately. QEEG features of theta wave in C3 had a marked impact on the model for classification according to the MIV algorithm. Conclusions PD-MCI is characterized by widespread structural and EEG abnormality. "Composite markers" could be valuable for the individualized diagnosis of PD-MCI by machine learning.

Motor Imagery (MI) electroencephalogram plays a critical role in BCI applications. To address the problem of lack of control instruction sets for brain-computer interfaces based on motor imagery, this paper proposes the use of a variable-length coding strategy to control the movement of a KUKA robotic arm with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). The motor imagery EEG signals are classified into four categories by using common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The classification results of the left-hand and right-hand motor imagery are encoded with binary Huffman Coding, and the codewords are mapped to 7 degrees of freedom of the robotic arm. The number of occurrences of each Huffman codeword is used to control the rotation angle of the corresponding degree of freedom. The classification results of tongue and feet motor imagery are used to enter and exit the selection of the degrees of freedom of the robotic arm, respectively. In the designed object grasping and placing scene, the instruction control using Huffman variable-length coding strategy reduces the time by 19 and 18 times, and the efficiency increases by 23.4% and 20.2%, respectively, compared with the use of binary fixed-length coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of Huffman coding enables the control of multiple degrees of freedom of a robotic arm using finite motor imagery classification categories. The method can improve the information transfer efficiency and expand the set of control instructions for brain-computer interfaces, which provides new ideas for the application scenarios of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces.

Early diagnosis of MCI can allow for treatment to improve cognitive function and reduce modifiable risk factors. Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of individual MCI detection from healthy control (HC) using a minimum duration of resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. Methods: In this study, nine different measurement durations (i.e., 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, and 270 s) were evaluated for MCI detection via the graph theory analysis and traditional machine learning approach, such as linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor algorithms. Moreover, feature representation- and classification-based transfer learning (TL) methods were applied to identify MCI from HC through the input of connectivity maps with 30 and 90 s duration. Results: There was no significant difference among the nine various time windows in the machine learning and graph theory analysis. The feature representation-based TL showed improved accuracy in both 30 and 90 s cases (i.e., 30 s: 81.27% and 90 s: 76.73%). Notably, the classification-based TL method achieved the highest accuracy of 95.81% using the pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model with the 30 s interval functional connectivity map input. Conclusion: The results indicate that a 30 s measurement of the resting-state with fNIRS could be used to detect MCI. Moreover, the combination of neuroimaging (e.g., functional connectivity maps) and deep learning methods (e.g., CNN and TL) can be considered as novel biomarkers for clinical computer-assisted MCI diagnosis.

Electroencephalograph (EEG) based human emotion detection is a challenging process due to the diversity, and complexity of human emotions. For recognizing diverse emotions, a novel model is presented in this paper. Initially, an average mean reference technique is used to eliminate the environmental artifacts, instrumentation artifacts, and biological artifacts from the EEG signals, which are collected from DEAP dataset. Next, feature extraction is carried out using Fast Fourier transform (FFT) with Power Spectral Density (PSD) to extract feature vectors from the denoised EEG signals. Further, feature dimensionality reduction is performed utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to diminish the dimensions of the extracted features. A total of 230 EEG feature vectors are given as the input to Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classifying valence and arousal emotion states. The proposed PCA-ANN model performance is validated in terms of average classification accuracy and f-score. The experimental outcome demonstrates that the proposed PCA-ANN model achieved an improved accuracy in emotion classification, which is effective compared to the existing models such as ensemble learning algorithm, a convolutional neural network with the statistical method, and sparse autoencoder with logistic regression. The proposed PCA-ANN model achieved 87.14% and 86.31% of accuracy in valence and arousal states, and obtained 90.45% and 92.03% of f-score value in valence and arousal emotion states.

The goal is to investigate the measurement accuracy of smartwatches when used as thermal comfort sensors to be integrated into Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control loops. Ten participants were exposed to various environmental conditions as well as warm - induced and cold-induced discomfort tests and 13 participants were exposed to a transient-condition while a network of sensors and a smartwatch collected both environmental parameters and heart rate variability (HRV). HRV features were used as input to Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms to establish whether a user was in discomfort, providing an average accuracy of 92.2 %. ML and Deep Learning regression algorithms were trained to predict the thermal sensation vote (TSV) in a transient environment and the results show that the aggregation of environmental and physiological quantities provide a better TSV prediction in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), 1.2 and 20% respectively, than just the HRV features used for the prediction. In conclusion, this experiment supports the assumption that physiological quantities related to thermal comfort can improve TSV prediction when combined with environmental quantities.

With the development in the field of neural networks, explainable AI (XAI), is being studied to ensure that artificial intelligence models can be explained. There are some attempts to apply neural networks to neuroscientific studies to explain neurophysiological information with high machine learning performances. However, most of those studies have simply visualized features extracted from XAI and seem to lack an active neuroscientific interpretation of those features. In this study, we have tried to actively explain the high-dimensional learning features contained in the neurophysiological information extracted from XAI, compared with the previously reported neuroscientific results. Approach. We designed a deep neural network classifier using 3D information (3D DNN) and a 3D class activation map (3D CAM) to visualize high-dimensional classification features. We used those tools to classify monkey electrocorticogram (ECoG) data obtained from the unimanual and bimanual movement experiment. Main results. The 3D DNN showed better classification accuracy than other machine learning techniques, such as 2D DNN. Unexpectedly, the activation weight in the 3D CAM analysis was high in the ipsilateral motor and somatosensory cortex regions, whereas the gamma-band power was activated in the contralateral areas during unimanual movement, which suggests that the brain signal acquired from the motor cortex contains information about both contralateral movement and ipsilateral movement. Moreover, the hand-movement classification system used critical temporal information at movement onset and offset when classifying bimanual movements. Significance. As far as we know, this is the first study to use high-dimensional neurophysiological information (spatial, spectral, and temporal) with the deep learning method, reconstruct those features, and explain how the neural network works. We expect that our methods can be widely applied and used in neuroscience and electrophysiology research from the point of view of the explainability of XAI as well as its performance.

The objective of this study was to determine if data from more easily applied non-invasive devices assessing neck muscle activity and heart rate (HR) alone could be used to differentiate between sleep stages. We developed, trained, and compared two machine learning models using neural networks and random forest algorithms to predict sleep stages from 15 variables (features) of the muscle activity and HR data collected from 12 cows in two environments. Using k-fold cross validation we compared the success of the models to the gold standard, Polysomnography (PSG). Overall, both models learned from the data and were able to accurately predict sleep stages from HR and muscle activity alone with classification accuracy in the range of similar human models. Further research is required to validate the models with a larger sample size, but the proposed methodology appears to give an accurate representation of sleep stages in cattle and could consequentially enable future sleep research into conditions affecting cow sleep and welfare.

CNN inference, on the other hand, is computationally costly. Traditional CPU and GPU-based neural network platforms have disadvantages of large size and high energy consumption, which make it difficult to deploy in industrial production sites. This work proposes a Software design automation CNN inference hardware accelerator. The aim is to speedup inference calculation and easy-to-use for light weight CNN. The design is implemented in the PYNQ-Z2 development board, which is based on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 System on Chip (SoC). The Proposed Framework consumes fewer logical resources on the FPGA while performing network functions rapidly and accurately. In addition, the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of resource consumption and performance against that of other researchers.

Methods: We developed an automated system using only EEG and EOG signals. First, automatic macro(30-s epochs) and micro-sleep (5-s mini-epochs) staging was performed. Features describing micro-sleep structure, EEG spectral content, EEG coherence, EEG complexity, and EOG energy were derived. All features were input to an ensemble of random forests, giving as outputs the probabilities of having RBD or not (P (RBD) and P (nonRBD), respectively). A patient was classified as having RBD if P (RBD)>P (nonRBD). The system was applied to 107 de novo PD patients: 54 had normal REM sleep (PDnonRBD), 26 had RBD (PD + RBD), and 27 had at least two RBEs without meeting electromyographic RBD cut-off (PD + RBE). Sleep diagnoses were made with video-polysomnography (v-PSG). Results: Considering PDnonRBD and PD + RBD patients only, the system identified RBD with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity over 80%. Among the features, micro-sleep instability had the highest importance for RBD identification. Considering PD + RBE patients, the ones who developed definite RBD after two years had significantly higher values of P (RBD) at baseline compared to the ones who did not. The former were distinguished from the latter with sensitivity and specificity over 75%. Conclusions: Our method identifies RBD in PD patients using only EEG and EOG signals. Micro-sleep instability could be a biomarker for RBD and for proximity of conversion from RBEs, as prodromal RBD, to definite RBD in PD patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, current approaches typically train a unique classifier for each subject. This subject-specific training scheme requires long labeled recordings from each patient, thus failing to detect symptoms in new patients with limited recordings. This paper introduces an unsupervised domain adaptation approach based on adversarial networks to enable few-shot, cross-subject epileptic seizure detection. Using adversarial learning, features from multiple patients were encoded into a subject-invariant space and a discriminative model was trained on subject-invariant features to make predictions. We evaluated this approach on the intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from 9 patients with epilepsy. Our approach enabled cross-subject seizure detection with a 9.4% improvement in 1-shot classification accuracy compared to the conventional subject-specific scheme.

Recent evidence suggests that the physiological states may explain this performance variation in BCI, however, the underlying neurophysiological mechanism is unclear. In this study, we conducted a seven-session motor-imagery (MI) experiment on 20 healthy subjects to investigate the neurophysiological mechanism on the performance variation. The classification accuracy was calculated offline by common spatial pattern (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to measure the MI performance of each subject and session. Relative Power (RP) values from different rhythms and task stages were used to reflect the physiological states and their correlation with the BCI performance was investigated. Results showed that the alpha band RP from the supplementary motor area (SMA) within a few seconds before MI was positively correlated with performance. Besides, the changes of RP between task and pre-task stage from theta, alpha, and gamma band were also found to be correlated with performance both across time and subjects. These findings reveal a neurophysiological manifestation of the performance variations, and would further provide a way to improve the BCI performance.

Statistical analyzes are performed to lacstral distances between conventional EEG subbands to find measures capable of discriminating AD in all stages and characterizing the AD activity in each electrode. Cepstral distances are used for comparison. Comparing all AD stages and Controls (C), the most important significances are the lacstral distances between subbands theta and alpha (p = 0.0014 < 0.05). The topographic maps show significant differences in parietal, temporal and frontal regions as AD progresses. Machine learning models with a leave-one-out cross-validation process are applied to lacstral/cepstral distances to develop an automatic method for diagnosing AD. The following classification accuracies are obtained with an artificial neural network: 95.55% for All vs All, 98.06% for C vs MCI, 95.99% for C vs ADM, 93.85% for MCI vs ADM-ADA. In C vs MCI, C vs ADM and MCI vs ADM-ADA, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art methods by 5%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. In All vs All, it outperforms the state-of-art EEG and non-EEG methods by 6% and 2%, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method represents an improvement in diagnosing AD.

However, adaptability of such technologies to the user is still an unmet goal. Despite important technological advances, these robotic systems still lack the fine tuning necessary to adapt to the physiological modification of the user and are not yet capable of a proper human-machine interaction. Interfaces based on physiological signals, e.g., recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) and/or electromyography (EMG), could contribute to solving this technological challenge. This protocol aims to: (1) quantify neuro-muscular plasticity induced by a single training session with a robotic exoskeleton on post-stroke people and on a group of age and sex-matched controls; (2) test the feasibility of predicting lower limb motor trajectory from physiological signals for future use as control signal for the robot. An active exoskeleton that can be set in full mode (i.e., the robot fully replaces and drives the user motion), adaptive mode (i.e., assistance to the user can be tuned according to his/her needs), and free mode (i.e., the robot completely follows the user movements) will be used. Participants will undergo a preparation session, i.e., EMG sensors and EEG cap placement and inertial sensors attachment to measure, respectively, muscular and cortical activity, and motion. They will then be asked to walk in a 15 m corridor: (i) self-paced without the exoskeleton (pre-training session); (ii) wearing the exoskeleton and walking with the three modes of use; (iii) self-paced without the exoskeleton (post-training session). From this dataset, we will: (1) quantitatively estimate short-term neuroplasticity of brain connectivity in chronic stroke survivors after a single session of gait training; (2) compare muscle activation patterns during exoskeleton-gait between stroke survivors and age and sex-matched controls; and (3) perform a feasibility analysis on the use of physiological signals to decode gait intentions.

Early identification of epilepsy surgery candidates: A multicenter, machine learning study	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						artificial intelligence; electronic health record; epilepsy; machine learning; medical informatics; neurology		Objectives Epilepsy surgery is underutilized. Automating the identification of potential surgical candidates may facilitate earlier intervention. Our objective was to develop site-specific machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify candidates before they undergo surgery. Materials & Methods In this multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study, ML algorithms were trained on n-grams extracted from free-text neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, visit codes, medications, procedures, laboratories, and demographic information. Site-specific algorithms were developed at two epilepsy centers: one pediatric and one adult. Cases were defined as patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery, and controls were patients with epilepsy with no history of surgery. The output of the ML algorithms was the estimated likelihood of candidacy for resective epilepsy surgery. Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. Results There were 5880 children (n = 137 had surgery [2.3%]) and 7604 adults with epilepsy (n = 56 had surgery [0.7%]) included in the study. Pediatric surgical patients could be identified 2.0 years (range: 0-8.6 years) before beginning their presurgical evaluation with AUC =0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82) and PR-AUC =0.13 (95% CI: 0.07-0.18). Adult surgical patients could be identified 1.0 year (range: 0-5.4 years) before beginning their presurgical evaluation with AUC =0.85 (95% CI: 0.78-0.93) and PR-AUC =0.31 (95% CI: 0.14-0.48). By the time patients began their presurgical evaluation, the ML algorithms identified pediatric and adult surgical patients with AUC =0.93 and 0.95, respectively. The mean squared error of the predicted probability of surgical candidacy (Brier scores) was 0.018 in pediatrics and 0.006 in adults. Conclusions Site-specific machine learning algorithms can identify candidates for epilepsy surgery early in the disease course in diverse practice settings.

Epileptic seizure detection using novel Multilayer LSTM Discriminant Network and dynamic mode Koopman decomposition	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Seizure detection; Common spatial pattern (CSP); Dynamic Mode Koopman Decomposition; (DMKD); Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD); Multilayer LSTM Discriminant Network	WAVELET TRANSFORM; AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; DESIGN	Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes abnormality in brain function and leads to unusual behavior, awareness loss and other defects. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrophysiological screening method used for diagnosing epileptic seizure and further brain activities. Usually, physicians inspect the brain abnormalities. But this technique is highly time-consuming, has poor consistency, and has faced difficulty in detecting the seizure due to the imbalanced distribution of data. To overcome these issues a novel seizure predicting algorithm has been proposed. Initially, data is pre-processed using modified common spatial pattern (CSP) which will convert various channels into alternate channels. This in turn results in a maximized signal to noise ratio. For feature extraction, Dynamic Mode Koopman Decomposition (DMKD) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been utilized by obtaining multiple IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions). A scheme called Novel Multilayer LSTM Discriminant Network is used for the classification process and is used for efficiently classifying featured vectors. The classification process is used for classifying ictal and non-ictal regions. To avoid misinterpretations and to reduce false alarm rate, post-processing is done. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed using various parameters such as accuracy, specification, sensitivity, Jaccard and other parameters. The proposed is compared with existing methods namely LMS (Least Mean Square) and Wiener in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal-toNoise Ratio), LMSE (Least Mean Square Error), Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) and error rates. From performance analysis, it is clear that the proposed framework with an efficient algorithm will provide effective detection for seizure and non-seizure patients.	[Saichand, N.

The objective of this work is to develop a 4D (3D+T) statistical anatomical atlas of the electrical properties of the upper part of the human head for cerebral electrophysiology and bioimpedance applications. Approach. The atlas was constructed based on 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 107 human individuals and comprises the electrical properties of the main internal structures and can be adjusted for specific electrical frequencies. T1w+T2w MRI images were used to segment the main structures of the head while angiography MRI was used to segment the main arteries. The proposed atlas also comprises a time-varying model of arterial brain circulation, based on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in the main arteries and their vascular territories. Main results. High-resolution, multi-frequency and time-varying anatomical atlases of resistivity, conductivity and relative permittivity were created and evaluated using a forward problem solver for EIT. The atlas was successfully used to simulate electrical impedance tomography measurements indicating the necessity of signal-to-noise between 100 and 125 dB to identify vascular changes due to the cardiac cycle, corroborating previous studies. The source code of the atlas and solver are freely available to download. Significance. Volume conductor problems in cerebral electrophysiology and bioimpedance do not have analytical solutions for nontrivial geometries and require a 3D model of the head and its electrical properties for solving the associated PDEs numerically. Ideally, the model should be made with patient-specific information. In clinical practice, this is not always the case and an average head model is often used. Also, the electrical properties of the tissues might not be completely known due to natural variability. Anatomical atlases are important tools for in silico studies on cerebral circulation and electrophysiology that require statistically consistent data, e.g. machine learning, sensitivity analyses, and as a benchmark to test inverse problem solvers.

Long work hours, sleep loss, circadian rhythm disruption, and workload are well-known reasons, but there is a need to accurately detect pilot mental fatigue to improve aviation safety. However, due to the highly restricted cockpit environment and the complex nature of mental fatigue, feasible in-flight detection remains under-investigated. The objective of this study is to define a promising approach for mental fatigue detection based on psychophysiological measurements in flying-relevant environments. Eleven participants engaged in a simulated flight experiment, where several conventional heart rate variability (HRV) and ocular indices were examined to study their relevance to mental fatigue. Additionally, a Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (TICC) method was performed to determine the ground truth, after which supervised machine learning was adopted to enable automated mental fatigue detection using HRV and eye metrics. Results showed that HRV and eye metrics were sensitive to the mental fatigue induced by prolonged flight-relevant tasks. The TICC method helped determine the ground truth for mental fatigue and identify its three distinct levels. Furthermore, a supervised learning-based detection of mental fatigue was achieved using a support vector machine with the greatest detection accuracy of 91.8%. The findings and methodology of this study provide new insights into the fatigue countermeasures in restricted cockpit environment and lay the groundwork for further explorations into the mental fatigue induced by prolonged flight missions.

Detection of high-frequency oscillations in electroencephalography: A scoping review and an adaptable open-source framework	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Review						Epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; Automated detection; Electroencephalography	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; FAST RIPPLES; K-MEANS; EPILEPSY; HFOS; CLASSIFICATION; HZ; IDENTIFICATION; RECORDINGS; IMPROVE	Purpose: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are putative biomarkers of epileptogenicity. These electrophysiological phenomena can be effectively detected in electroencephalography using automated methods. Nonetheless, the implementation of these methods into clinical practice remains challenging as significant variability exists between algorithms and their characterizations of HFOs. Here, we perform a scoping review of the literature pertaining to automated HFO detection methods. In addition, we propose a framework for defining and detecting HFOs based on a simplified single-stage time-frequency based detection algorithm with clinically familiar parameters. Methods: Several databases (OVID Medline, Web of Science, PubMed) were searched for articles presenting novel, automated HFO detection methods. Details related to the algorithm and various stages of data acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis were abstracted from included studies. Results: From the 261 records screened, 57 articles presented novel, automated HFO detection methods and were included in the scoping review. These algorithms were categorized into 3 groups based on their most salient features: energy thresholding, time-frequency analysis, and data mining/machine learning. Algorithms were optimized for specific datasets and suffered from low specificity. A framework for user-constrained inputs is proposed to circumvent some of the weaknesses of highly performant detectors. Conclusions: Further efforts are required to optimize and validate existing automated HFO detection methods for clinical utility. The proposed framework may be applied to understand and standardize the variations in HFO definitions across institutions.

Researchers have developed different algorithms and techniques to automatically track the gaze position and direction, which are helpful in different applications. Research on eye tracking is increasing owing to its ability to facilitate many different tasks, particularly for the elderly or users with special needs. This study aims to explore and review eye tracking concepts, methods, and techniques by further elaborating on efficient and effective modern approaches such as machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing. These approaches have been in use for more than two decades and are heavily used in the development of recent eye tracking applications. The results of this study indicate that ML and IoT are important aspects in evolving eye tracking applications owing to their ability to learn from existing data, make better decisions, be flexible, and eliminate the need to manually re-calibrate the tracker during the eye tracking process. In addition, they show that eye tracking techniques have more accurate detection results compared with traditional event-detection methods. In addition, various motives and factors in the use of a specific eye tracking technique or application are explored and recommended. Finally, some future directions related to the use of eye tracking in several developed applications are described.

There has been a long-standing debate on whether attentional capture can be explained by goal-driven and/or stimulus-driven accounts. Here, we shed further light on this matter by using EEG activity (raw EEG and alpha power) to provide a time-resolved index of attentional orienting towards salient stimuli that either matched or did not match target-defining properties. A search display containing the target stimulus was preceded by a spatially uninformative singleton cue that either matched the color of the upcoming target (contingent cues), or that appeared in an irrelevant color (non-contingent cues). Multivariate analysis of raw EEG and alpha power revealed preferential tuning to the location of both contingent and non-contingent cues, with a stronger bias towards contingent than non-contingent cues. The time course of these effects, however, depended on the neural signal. Raw EEG data revealed attentional orienting towards the contingent cue early on in the trial (>156 ms), while alpha power revealed sustained spatial selection in the cued locations at a later moment in the trial (>250 ms). Moreover, while raw EEG showed stronger capture by contingent cues during this early time window, an advantage for contingent cues arose during a later time window in alpha band activity. Thus, our findings suggest that raw EEG activity and alpha-band power tap into distinct neural processes that index separate aspects of covert spatial attention.

Epileptic Seizure Prediction: A Semi-Dilated Convolutional Neural Network Architecture	2020 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION (ICPR)	International Conference on Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)	JAN 10-15, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, IEEE Comp Soc, Italian Assoc Comp Vis Pattern Recognit & Machine Learning			DRUG-RESISTANT EPILEPSY	Accurate prediction of epileptic seizures has remained elusive, despite the many advances in machine learning and time-series classification. In this work, we develop a convolutional network module that exploits Electroencephalogram (EEG) scalograms to distinguish between the pre-seizure and normal brain activities. Since these scalograms have rectangular image shapes with many more temporal bins than spectral bins, the presented module uses "semi-dilated convolutions" to create a proportional non-square receptive field. The proposed semi-dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field over the long dimension (image width, i.e. time) while maintaining high resolution over the short dimension (image height, i.e., frequency). The proposed architecture comprises a set of co-operative semi-dilated convolutional blocks, each block has a stack of parallel semi-dilated convolutional modules with different dilation rates. Results show that our proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving seizure prediction sensitivity scores of 88.45% and 89.52% for the American Epilepsy Society and Melbourne University EEG datasets, respectively.

Thus, seizure detection before its actual occurrence is quintessential to ensure that the right kind of preventive treatment is given to the patient. The predictive analysis is carried out in the preictal state of the Epileptic Seizure that corresponds to the state that commences a couple of minutes before the onset of the seizure. In this paper, the average value of prediction time is restricted to 23.4 minutes for a total of 23 subjects. This paper intends to compare the accuracy of three different predictive models, namely - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and XGBoost Classifier based on the study of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and determine which model has the highest rate of detection of Epileptic Seizure.

Many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems use a large amount of channels for higher performance, which is time-consuming to set up and inconvenient for practical applications. Finding an optimal subset of channels without compromising the performance is a necessary and challenging task. Approach. In this article, we proposed a cross-correlation based discriminant criterion (XCDC) which assesses the importance of a channel for discriminating the mental states of different motor imagery (MI) tasks. Channels are ranked and selected according to the proposed criterion. The efficacy of XCDC is evaluated on two MI EEG datasets. Main results. On the two datasets, the proposed method reduces the channel number from 71 and 15 to under 18 and 11 respectively without compromising the classification accuracy on unseen data. Under the same constraint of accuracy, the proposed method requires fewer channels than existing channel selection methods based on Pearson's correlation coefficient and common spatial pattern. Visualization of XCDC shows consistent results with neurophysiological principles. Significance. This work proposes a quantitative criterion for assessing and ranking the importance of EEG channels in MI tasks and provides a practical method for selecting the ranked channels in the calibration phase of MI BCI systems, which alleviates the computational complexity and configuration difficulty in the subsequent steps, leading to real-time and more convenient BCI systems.

One of the predominant tools in topological data analysis is persistent homology, which is used to create topological sum-maries of data called persistence diagrams. Persistent homology offers a novel method for signal analysis. Herein, we aid interpretation of the sublevel set persistence diagrams of signals by 1) showing the effect of frequency and in-stantaneous amplitude on the persistence diagrams for a family of deterministic signals, and 2) providing a general equation for the probability density of persis-tence diagrams of random signals via a pushforward measure. We also provide a topologically-motivated, efficiently computable statistical descriptor analo-gous to the power spectral density for signals based on a generalized Bayesian framework for persistence diagrams. This Bayesian descriptor is shown to be competitive with power spectral densities and continuous wavelet transforms at distinguishing signals with different dynamics in a classification problem with autoregressive signals.

EEG-Based Eye Movement Recognition Using Brain-Computer Interface and Random Forests	SENSORS			English	Article						brain&#8211; computer interface; electroencephalogram; electrooculogram; eye tracking; random forests; EEG; eye movement; EPOC Flex		Discrimination of eye movements and visual states is a flourishing field of research and there is an urgent need for non-manual EEG-based wheelchair control and navigation systems. This paper presents a novel system that utilizes a brain-computer interface (BCI) to capture electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from human subjects while eye movement and subsequently classify them into six categories by applying a random forests (RF) classification algorithm. RF is an ensemble learning method that constructs a series of decision trees where each tree gives a class prediction, and the class with the highest number of class predictions becomes the model's prediction. The categories of the proposed random forests brain-computer interface (RF-BCI) are defined according to the position of the subject's eyes: open, closed, left, right, up, and down. The purpose of RF-BCI is to be utilized as an EEG-based control system for driving an electromechanical wheelchair (rehabilitation device). The proposed approach has been tested using a dataset containing 219 records taken from 10 different patients. The BCI implemented the EPOC Flex head cap system, which includes 32 saline felt sensors for capturing the subjects' EEG signals. Each sensor caught four different brain waves (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) per second. Then, these signals were split in 4-second windows resulting in 512 samples per record and the band energy was extracted for each EEG rhythm. The proposed system was compared with naive Bayes, Bayes Network, k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), J48-C4.5 decision tree, and Bagging classification algorithms. The experimental results showed that the RF algorithm outperformed compared to the other approaches and high levels of accuracy (85.39%) for a 6-class classification are obtained. This method exploits high spatial information acquired from the Emotiv EPOC Flex wearable EEG recording device and examines successfully the potential of this device to be used for BCI wheelchair technology.

In this study, the slope sign change (SSC) and mean power frequency (MPF) features of EEG and sEMG were used to recognize the seven gait phases [loading response (LR), mid-stance (MST), terminal stance (TST), pre-swing (PSW), initial swing (ISW), mid-swing (MSW), and terminal swing (TSW)]. Previous researchers have found that the cortex is involved in the regulation of treadmill walking. However, corticomuscular interaction analysis in a high level of gait phase granularity remains lacking in the time-frequency domain, and the feasibility of gait phase recognition based on EEG combined with sEMG is unknown. Therefore, the time-frequency cross mutual information (TFCMI) method was applied to research the theoretical basis of gait control in seven gait phases using beta-band EEG and sEMG data. We firstly found that the feature set comprising SSC of EEG as well as SSC and MPF of sEMG was robust for the recognition of seven gait phases under three different walking speeds. Secondly, the distribution of TFCMI values in eight topographies (eight muscles) was different at PSW and TSW phases. Thirdly, the differences of corticomuscular interaction between LR and MST and between TST and PSW of eight muscles were not significant. These insights enrich previous findings of the authors who have carried out gait phase recognition and provide a theoretical basis for gait recognition based on EEG and sEMG.

J	Hundrieser, M; Mattes, A; Stahl, J				Hundrieser, Manuela; Mattes, Andre; Stahl, Jutta			Predicting participants' attitudes from patterns of event-related potentials during the reading of morally relevant statements - An MVPA investigation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Attitude; Evaluative conflict; Language processing; Moral decision; MPVA; ERP		Morality and language are hardly separable, given that morality-related aspects such as knowledge, emotions, or experiences are connected with language on different levels. One question that arises is: How rapidly do neural processes set in when processing statements that reflect moral value containing information? In the current study, participants read sentences about morally relevant statements (e.g., 'Wars are acceptable') and expressed their (dis)agreement with the statements while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Multivariate pattern classification (MVPA) was used during language processing to predict the individual's response. Our results show that (1) the response ('yes' vs. 'no') could be predicted from 180 ms following the decision-relevant word (here acceptable), and (2) the attitude (pro vs. contra the topic) could be predicted from 170 ms following the topic word (here wars). We suggest that the successful MVPA classification is due to different brain activity patterns evoked by differences in activated mental representations (e.g. valence, arousal, etc.) depending on whether the attitude towards the topic is positive or negative and whether it is in accordance with the presented decisive word or not.

Participants listened to 45 kinds of single-tone melodies produced by piano sounds set on the same tempo. Training labels (onset or not-onset) were given by 100 ms using the scores of the melodies. An EEG while listening music was divided into segments with a window width of 500 ms and an overlap of 100 ms. Then, we solve the classification problems using logistic regression (LR) or support vector machine (SVM). We report that five out of fourteen participants' areas under the curve (AUC) indicated more than 0.7. Furthermore, when the predicted onset sequence was used to predict the musical stimulus being listened to, the maximum classification accuracy was 91.7%. These results suggest that each note can be decoded from brain response. The proposed approach can measure brain responses to each note or adapted for brain-computer interface (BCI) using natural music.

Barriers to explainable processes include black-box classifiers, such as deep learning, and noisy datasets. Affect recognition involving neural networks attempts to map complex human emotions onto Arousal and Valence scales based on physiological signal measurements. Datasets collected for this purpose are inherently noisy and may contain outliers and imbalanced classes, hindering accurate classification. In our approach, these issues are addressed using Fuzzy ART (FA) for clustering data samples into more condensed memory templates, introducing stochastic resonant noise to amplify signal-to-noise ratio, and SMOTE sampling to generate synthetic minority samples. A genetic algorithm is developed for FA optimization and ensemble model selection. Clusters obtained from the resulting ensembles are then used to train an ensemble of boosted decision trees for classification and to visualize the decision-making processes. Individual features such as heart rate variability and EEG band power, as well as feature interactions between pairs of features, may contain critical information as human affect indicators. Contributions of individual features and feature interactions toward describing human affect are quantified and interpreted using Shapley additive explanation values. Three established affect recognition datasets were considered for mapping physiological features onto a binary classification of Low/High Arousal and Positive/Negative Valence. Our framework was able to achieve good generalization for both classification tasks as well as provide detailed insights into the contributions of physiological features towards describing Arousal and Valence affects.

However, the performance of the detection methods is still not satisfactory. One of the challenges is to find a proper representation for the electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which could preserve the temporal information and maintain the spatial topological characteristics. Inspired by the deep learning (DL) methods in the research of brain-computer interface (BCI) field, a 3D representation of EEG signal was introduced into attention detection task, and a 3D convolutional neural network model with cascade and parallel convolution operations was proposed. The model utilized three cascade blocks, each consisting of two parallel 3D convolution branches, to simultaneously extract the multi-scale features. Evaluated on a public dataset containing twenty-six subjects, the proposed model achieved better performance compared with the baseline methods under the intra-subject, inter-subject and subject-adaptive classification scenarios. This study demonstrated the promising potential of the 3D CNN model for detecting attentive mental state. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a novel Brain-Inspired Spiking Neural Network (BI-SNN) model for incremental learning of spike sequences. BI-SNN maps spiking activity from input channels into a high dimensional source-space which enhances the evolution of polychronising spiking neural populations. We applied the BI-SNN to predict muscle activity and kinematics from electroencephalography signals during upper limb functional movements. The BI-SNN extends our previously proposed eSPANNet computational model by integrating it with the 'NeuCube' brain-inspired SNN architecture. We show that BI-SNN can successfully predict continuous muscle activity and kinematics of upper-limb. The experimental results confirmed that the BI-SNN resulted in strongly correlated population activity and demonstrated the feasibility for real-time prediction. In contrast to the majority of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that constitute a 'black box', BI-SNN provide quantitative and visual feedback about the related brain activity. This study is one of the first attempts to examine the feasibility of finding neural correlates of muscle activity and kinematics from electroencephalography using a brain-inspired computational paradigm. The findings suggest that BI-SNN is a better neural decoder for non-invasive BCI.

In the area of physiological signal processing for prosthesis control, scenarios where a signal decomposition analysis are required: the wavelet decomposition (WD) has been seen to be the favoured time-frequency approach for the decomposition of non-stationary signals. From a research perspective, the WD in certain cases has allowed for a more accurate motion intent decoding process following feature extraction and classification. Despite this, there is yet to be a widespread adaptation of the WD in a practical setting due to perceived computational complexity. Here, for neuromuscular (electromyography) and brainwave (electroencephalography) signals acquired from a transhumeral amputee, a computationally efficient time domain signal decomposition method based on a series of heuristics was applied to process the acquired signals before feature extraction. The results showed an improvement in motion intent decoding prowess for the proposed time-domain-based signal decomposition across four different classifiers for both the neuromuscular and brain wave signals when compared to the WD and the raw signal.

In human brain cerebrum or cerebral hemispheres are the most commonly involved brain regions in epilepsy. In case of antiepileptic drugs failure, surgical treatment is the best cure possible for which correct localization of epileptogenic region is a challenging task for neurologists as well as for computer scientist for automatic localization. This research work's aim is to explore the functional activities of all brain regions in drug-resistant focal epileptic patients and achieve high accuracy for the classification of epileptogenic region (ER) with the high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) data. The proposed system includes frequency analysis for feature extractions followed by individual subject's registration of hdEEG signals with anatomical brain images for most precise localization of ER possible. The datasets attained from feature extraction process are then preprocessed for class imbalanced and then evaluated using different machine learning domains including the techniques under Bayesian networks, Lazy networks, Meta techniques, Rule based systems and Tree structured algorithms. Considering human brain both as stationary object as well as dynamic object, frequency-based and time frequency-based features are considered in 12 subjects respectively. Through this novel approach 99.70% accuracy is achieved to classify ER from healthy regions using KSTAR and IBK algorithm and 91.60% accuracy has been achieved to classify generator from propagator regions by applying IBK algorithm.

Recognizing motor intention is crucial for realizing BCI rehabilitation training. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a kind of electroencephalogram (EEG) inherent characteristics associated with motor intention. However, due to brain deficits poststroke, some patients are not able to generate ERD, which discourages them to be involved in BCI rehabilitation training. To boost ERD during motor imagery (MI), this paper investigates the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on BCI classification performance. Eleven subjects participated in this study. The experiment consisted of two conditions: rTMS + MI versus sham rTMS + MI, which were arranged on different days. MI tests with 64-channel EEG recording were arranged immediately before and after rTMS and sham rTMS. Time-frequency analysis were utilized to measure ERD changes. Common spatial pattern was used to extract features and linear discriminant analysis was used to calculate offline classification accuracies. Paired-sample West and Wilcoxon signed rank tests with post-hoc analysis were used to compare performance before and after stimulation. Statistically stronger ERD (-13.93 +/- 12.99%) was found after real rTMS compared with ERD (-5.71 +/- 21.25% before real rTMS (p<0.05). Classification accuracy after real rTMS (70.71 +/- 10.32%) tended to be higher than that before real rTMS (66.50 +/- 8.48%) (p<0.1). However, no statistical differences were found after sham stimulation. This research provides an effective method in improving BCI performance by utilizing neural modulation.

Studies on cortical effective connectivity (EC) during sleep may provide more direct and pathological information and shed new light on brain dysfunction due to SAHS. However, the EC is rarely explored in SAHS patients, especially during different sleep stages. Methods: To this end, six-channel EEG signals of 43 SAHS patients and 41 healthy participants were recorded by whole-night polysomnography (PSG). The symbolic transfer entropy (STE) was applied to measure the EC between cortical regions in different frequency bands. Posterior-anterior ratio (PA) was employed to evaluate the posterior-to-anterior pattern of information flow based on overall cortical EC. The statistical characteristics of the STE and PA and of the intra-individual normalized parameters (STE* and PA*) were served as different feature sets for classifying the severity of SAHS. Results: Although the patterns of STE across electrodes were similar, significant differences were found between the patient and the control groups. The variation trends across stages in the PA were also different in multiple frequency bands between groups. Important features extracted from the STE* and PA* were distributed in multiple rhythms, mainly in delta, alpha, and gamma. The PA* feature set gave the best results, with accuracies of 98.8% and 83.3% for SAHS diagnosis (binary) and severity classification (four-way). Conclusions: These results suggest that modifications in cortical EC were existed in SAHS patients during sleep, which may help characterize cortical abnormality in patients. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the information carried by their phases is fundamental for the coordination of anatomically distributed processing in the brain. The concept of phase transfer entropy refers to an information theory-based measure of directed connectivity among neural oscillations that allows studying such distributed processes. Phase TE is commonly obtained from probability estimations carried out over data from multiple trials, which bars its use as a characterization strategy in brain-computer interfaces. In this work, we propose a novel methodology to estimate TE between single pairs of instantaneous phase time series. Our approach combines a kernel-based TE estimator defined in terms of Renyi's alpha entropy, which sidesteps the need for probability distribution computation with phase time series obtained by complex filtering the neural signals. Besides, a kernel-alignment-based relevance analysis is added to highlight relevant features from effective connectivity-based representation supporting further classification stages in EEG-based brain-computer interface systems. Our proposal is tested on simulated coupled data and two publicly available databases containing EEG signals recorded under motor imagery and visual working memory paradigms. Attained results demonstrate how the introduced effective connectivity succeeds in detecting the interactions present in the data for the former, with statistically significant results around the frequencies of interest. It also reflects differences in coupling strength, is robust to realistic noise and signal mixing levels, and captures bidirectional interactions of localized frequency content. Obtained results for the motor imagery and working memory databases show that our approach, combined with the relevance analysis strategy, codes discriminant spatial and frequency-dependent patterns for the different conditions in each experimental paradigm, with classification performances that do well in comparison with those of alternative methods of similar nature.

With the recent development of artificial intelligence, there have been many developments in the drone control system. BCI characteristic that can reflect the users' intentions led to the BCI-based drone control system. When using drone swarm, we can have more advantages, such as mission diversity, than using a single drone. In particular, BCI-based drone swarm control could provide many advantages to various industries such as military service or industry disaster. BCI Paradigms consist of the exogenous and endogenous paradigms. The endogenous paradigms can operate with the users' intentions independently of any stimulus. In this study, we designed endogenous paradigms (i.e., motor imagery (MI), visual imagery (VI), and speech imagery (SI)) specialized in drone swarm control, and EEG-based various task classifications related to drone swarm control were conducted. Five subjects participated in the experiment and the performance was evaluated using the basic machine learning algorithm. The grand-averaged accuracies were 37.6% (+/- 6.78), 43.2% (+/- 3.44), and 31.6% (+/- 1.07) in MI, VI, and SI, respectively. Hence, we confirmed the feasibility of increasing the degree of freedom for drone swarm control using various endogenous paradigms.

Qualitative comparison between MI and ME reveals a significant difference in response time, activation magnitude, and cortical source distribution. Based on these differences, different frameworks of MI and ME have been developed for enhanced brain computer interface (BCI) applications by providing task specific information in time and cortical source space. Decoding of subject's intent using cortical source domain processing increases the accuracy in the MI and ME scenario by 5.18 and 3.68%, respectively, compared with the conventional sensor domain processing. The performance of the proposed methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques. The present study highlights the limitation of cross framework, i.e., utilization of MI framework in ME experimental paradigm or vice versa. In particular, the performance degradation of MI and ME tasks was observed in the cross framework scenario. The experimental results are expected to provide an evidence for researchers when designing an imagery or execution based online (or offline) BCI system.

In this study, we have quantitatively compared event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns during tasks of pure MI, MI with AO (O-MI), ME, and ME with AO (O-ME) of the leg to investigate the underlying neuronal mechanisms using EEG. Subjects were instructed to imagine or perform rhythmical actions while watching a video of leg movements during O-MI and O-ME tasks; In contrast, subjects imagined and performed the leg movements without observing any video during pure MI and ME tasks. We noticed that the amplitude of ERDs from MI, O-MI, ME and O-ME sequentially increases in central regions of the brain. These quantified ERD patterns in EEG were used to study the differences of brain oscillatory changes among the four tasks. We found that ERDs in motor area were more distinct in O-MI, compared with pure MI. These results suggest that O-MI produced stronger motor activations than MI. Plus, O-ME showed significantly greater activations than ME in the beta band. O-ME has produced stronger neurophysiological effects than MI, and stronger behavioral effects than ME. These empirical results do provide convincing evidence of the dual tasks such combined MI or ME with action observation on brain pattern changes. The video of the goal-directed leg movements is most likely able to improve the ability of performing or imagining movements. O-MI and O-ME may get better and closer therapeutic effects in leg rehabilitation and motor skill training. Furthermore, the extent analysis of ERD may provide the basis for evaluating the ability of O-MI and O-ME in leg rehabilitation and motor skill training.

Methods: This was an observational study evaluating SISCOM patterns in 40 children with TLE. We classified SISCOM patterns into 4 categories; (i) unilateral anteromesial and/or anterolateral temporal pattern; (ii) unilateral anteromesial and/or anterolateral temporal plus posterior extension pattern; (iii) bilateral anteromesial and/or anterolateral temporal pattern; and (iv) atypical pattern. Determinants of SISCOM pattern and correlation between postoperative outcomes and SISCOM patterns were evaluated. Results: Pattern (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) were identified in 10 (25%), 14 (35%), 0 (0%), and 16 (40%) patients, respectively. There was no significant correlation between patterns and postoperative outcomes. SISCOM patterns significantly associated with the presence of hippocampal sclerosis and type of focal cortical dysplasia (p-value = 0.048 and 0.036, respectively). Patients with HS had 5 times the odds of having unilateral temporal pattern, compared to patients with other neuropathology (OR = 5, 95% CI 0.92 to 27.08). Patients with FCD type 2 had 9.71 times the odds of having atypical pattern, compared to patients with other types of FCD (OR = 9.71, 95% CI 0.92 to 103.04). Lobar concordance of SISCOM and ictal and interictal scalp EEG significantly correlated with postoperative outcomes (p-value = 0.018 and 0.013, respectively) . Conclusion: Three SISCOM patterns were seen. Patients with HS had increased odds of having unilateral temporal pattern while patients with FCD type 2 had increased odds of having atypical pattern. However, there was no significant correlation between SISCOM patterns and postoperative outcomes. Lobar concordance of SISCOM and ictal and interictal scalp EEG significantly correlated with postoperative outcome. Significance: This study shows that the distribution of SISCOM patterns and their relationship with postoperative outcomes in children with TLE are different from adult population. Besides, SISCOM may add only limited diagnostic and prognostic information in children with drug-resistant TLE undergoing epilepsy surgery. Further evaluation to identify patient populations that may benefit from SISCOM is desirable. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

P300s are one of the most studied event-related potentials (ERPs), which have been widely used for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Thus, fast and accurate recognition of P300s is an important issue for BCI study. Recently, there emerges a lot of novel classification algorithms for P300-speller. Among them, discriminative canonical pattern matching (DCPM) has been proven to work effectively, in which discriminative spatial pattern (DSP) filter can significantly enhance the spatial features of P300s. However, the pattern of ERPs in space varies with time, which was not taken into consideration in the traditional DCPM algorithm. Approach. In this study, we developed an advanced version of DCPM, i.e. multi-window DCPM, which contained a series of time-dependent DSP filters to fine-tune the extraction of spatial ERP features. To verify its effectiveness, 25 subjects were recruited and they were asked to conduct the typical P300-speller experiment. Main results. As a result, multi-window DCPM achieved the character recognition accuracy of 91.84% with only five training characters, which was significantly better than the traditional DCPM algorithm. Furthermore, it was also compared with eight other popular methods, including SWLDA, SKLDA, STDA, BLDA, xDAWN, HDCA, sHDCA and EEGNet. The results showed multi-window DCPM preformed the best, especially using a small calibration dataset. The proposed algorithm was applied to the BCI Controlled Robot Contest of P300 paradigm in 2019 World Robot Conference, and won the first place. Significance. These results demonstrate that multi-window DCPM is a promising method for improving the performance and enhancing the practicability of P300-speller.

However, the recognition of MI relies on the event-related desynchronization (ERD) feature, which has poor task specificity. Further, there is the problem of false triggering (irrelevant mental activities recognized as the MI of the target limb). In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of reducing the false triggering rate using a novel paradigm, in which the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) is combined with the MI (MI-SSSEP). Data from the target (right hand MI) and nontarget task (rest) were used to establish the recognition model, and three kinds of interference tasks were used to test the false triggering performance. In the MI-SSSEP paradigm, ERD and SSSEP features modulated by MI could be used for recognition, while in the MI paradigm, only ERD features could be used. The results showed that the false triggering rate of interference tasks with SSSEP features was reduced to 29.3%, which was far lower than the 55.5% seen under the MI paradigm with ERD features. Moreover, in the MI-SSSEP paradigm, the recognition rate of the target and nontarget task was also significantly improved. Further analysis showed that the specificity of SSSEP was significantly higher than that of ERD (p < 0.05), but the sensitivity was not significantly different. These results indicated that SSSEP modulated by MI could more specifically decode the target task MI, and thereby may have potential in achieving more accurate rehabilitation training.

The models deployed at the back of the systems mostly analyse the correlations or dependencies between the input and output to uncover the important characteristics of the input features, but they lack explainability and interpretability that causing the acceptability issues of intelligent systems and raising the research domain of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this study, to overcome these shortcomings, a hybrid XAI approach is developed to explain an AI/ML model's inference mechanism as well as the final outcome. The overall approach comprises of 1) a convolutional encoder that extracts deep features from the data and computes their relevancy with features extracted using domain knowledge, 2) a model for classifying data points using the features from autoencoder, and 3) a process of explaining the model's working procedure and decisions using mutual information to provide global and local interpretability. To demonstrate and validate the proposed approach, experimentation was performed using an electroencephalography dataset from road safety to classify drivers' in-vehicle mental workload. The outcome of the experiment was found to be promising that produced a Support Vector Machine classifier for mental workload with approximately 89% performance accuracy. Moreover, the proposed approach can also provide an explanation for the classifier model's behaviour and decisions with the combined illustration of Shapely values and mutual information.

In a previous study, we designed a complex object coupling manipulation task that required tight performance and induced high cognitive workload. We hypothesize that strong-effort-related physiological reactivity during the dynamic manipulation task improves the user performance in an undesired task feedback situation. To test this hypothesis, using the motor intentions' discrimination from electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, we evaluate the effort expended by 20 participants in a controlling task with constraints involving complex coupling objects. Specifically, the finer motor decisions are obtained from the controlling information in EEG by using two fingers from the same hand rather than two hands. The motor intention is decoded from a task-dependent EEG through a regularized discriminant analysis, and the area under the curve is similar to 0.94. Furthermore, we compare the undesired and desired task feedback conditions along with the individual's effort dynamic adjustment, and investigate whether the undesired task feedback improved the discrimination of the motor activities. A stronger effort to attain the desired feedback state corresponds to improved motor activity discrimination from the EEG in the undesired task feedback scenario. The differences in the brain activities under the undesired and desired task feedback conditions are analyzed using brain-network-based topographical scalp maps. Our experiment provides preliminary evidence that inducing strong effort can improve discrimination performance during highly demanding tasks. This finding can advance our understanding of human attention, potentially improve the accuracy of intention recognition, and may inspire better EEG acquisition contexts.

Effect of stimulus direction on motion-onset visual evoked potentials decoded using spatiotemporal beamforming Abstract	2021 10TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International IEEE-EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAY 04-06, 2021	Prague, ELECTR NETWORK	Medtronic, Blackrock Microsystems, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Inst Italiano Tecnologia, Biorobot Inst, Sant Anna Sch Adv Studies, Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Wearable Robot, Frontiers Neuroscience, EPFL, Elsevier, CorTec, Abbott, Univ Pittsburgh, IEEE Transact Neural Syst & Rehabilitat Engn, IEEE Open Journal Engn Med & Biol		EEG; Spatiotemporal Beamformer; motion-onset VEP; BCI		Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) establish a direct communication channel between the brain and a computer bypassing the former's output pathways. A less explored yet less taxing visual BCI paradigm relies on a briefly moving stimulus, the onset of which elicits a lateralized potential over the parieto-occipital scalp area called motion-onset visual evoked potental (mVEP). In this study, the effect of stimulation direction on this potential is investigated both in terms of scalp activation and BCI performance. A novel regularized spatiotemporal beamforming algorithm for mVEP decoding is introduced, and its performance compared to that of traditional mVEP decoders. While a clear dependency in scalp activation for stimulus direction is observed, it does not affect BCI performance for any of the considered decoders.

J	Chang, L; Wang, RF; Zhang, Y				Chang, Liang; Wang, Raofen; Zhang, Yu			Decoding SSVEP patterns from EEG via multivariate variational mode decomposition-informed canonical correlation analysis	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); Sparrow search algorithm (SSA); Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); Inherent mode functions (IMFs); Multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FREQUENCY RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; BCI; TECHNOLOGY; SEIZURE; P300	Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is one of the most popular neural patterns used to develop braincomputer interface (BCI). To address the issue of electroencephalogram (EEG) is easily interfered with noise artifacts and differences in SSVEP components between different channels and different frequency bands. We propose multivariate variational mode decomposition-informed canonical correlation analysis (MVMD-CCA) to improve the decoding performance of SSVEP patterns. Firstly, the multivariate variational mode decomposition method is used to decompose electroencephalogram into inherent mode functions (IMFs) of different frequency bands for minimizing the effects of artifacts. Then, the obtained inherent mode functions components of various frequencies and channels are weighted to reconstruct the electroencephalogram signal. Furthermore, it has a fast convergence speed and good stability when using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) to optimize the weight parameters. Finally, the weighted reconstructed signal is classified by the canonical correlation analysis (CCA). An extensive experimental analysis is implemented with electroencephalogram collected from nine subjects use an eight-target SSVEP system. Results show that the multivariate variational mode decomposition-informed canonical correlation analysis significantly outperforms the canonical correlation analysis, with a maximum increase of 14.2% in SSVEP decoding accuracy. Simultaneously, the information transfer rate (ITR) increased by 6.5. An extensive comparison was performed between the proposed method and other competing approaches, including multivariate synchronization index (MSI), temporally local multivariate synchronization index (TMSI), and filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA). The superiority of our method demonstrates its great promise in the development of improved BCI systems.

WaveSleepNet: An interpretable deep convolutional neural network for the continuous classification of mouse sleep and wake	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Machine learning; Sleep disruption; Wavelets; Autoscoring; Computer vision	COMPUTER-AIDED DETECTION; STAGE; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; CANCER	Background: Recent advancement in deep learning provides a pivotal opportunity to potentially supplement or supplant the limiting step of manual sleep scoring. New method: In this paper, we characterize the WaveSleepNet (WSN), a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that uses wavelet transformed images of mouse EEG/EMG signals to autoscore sleep and wake. Results: WSN achieves an epoch by epoch mean accuracy of 0.86 and mean F1 score of 0.82 compared to manual scoring by a human expert. In mice experiencing mechanically induced sleep fragmentation, an overall epoch by epoch mean accuracy of 0.80 is achieved by WSN and classification of non-REM (NREM) sleep is not compromised, but the high level of sleep fragmentation results in WSN having greater difficulty differentiating REM from NREM sleep. We also find that WSN achieves similar levels of accuracy on an independent dataset of externally acquired EEG/EMG recordings with an overall epoch by epoch accuracy of 0.91. We also compared conventional summary sleep metrics in mice sleeping ad libitum. WSN systematically biases sleep fragmentation metrics of bout number and bout length leading to an overestimated degree of sleep fragmentation. Comparison with existing methods: In a cross-validation, WSN has a greater macro and stage-specific accuracy compared to a conventional random forest classifier. Examining the WSN, we find that it automatically learns spectral features consistent with manual scoring criteria that are used to define each class. Conclusion: These results suggest to us that WSN is capable of learning visually agreeable features and may be useful as a supplement to human manual scoring.

Task-irrelevant and redundant channels used in BCI may lead to low classification accuracy, high computational complexity, and inconvenience for application. By selecting optimal channels, the performance of BCI could enhance significantly. Method: In this paper, a new binary harmony search (BHS) is proposed to select the optimal channel sets and optimize the system accuracy. The BHS is implemented on the training data sets to select the optimal channels and the test data sets are used to evaluate the classification performance on the selected channels. The sparse representation-based classification, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machine are performed on the common spatial pattern (CSP) features for motor imagery (MI) classification. Results: Two public EEG datasets are employed to validate the proposed BHS method. The paired t-test is conducted on the test classification performance between the BHS and traditional CSP with all channels. The results reveal that the proposed BHS method significantly improved classification accuracy as compared to the conventional CSP method (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study proposed the BHS method to select the optimal channels in MI-based BCI. On the one hand, the results confirm the validity of the BHS algorithm as a channel selection method for motor imagery data. On the other hand, the BHS method with costing shorter computation time relatively yields a better average test accuracy than the steady-state genetic algorithms.

Heading for motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) usable out-of-the-lab: Impact of dry electrode setup on classification accuracy	2021 10TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International IEEE-EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	MAY 04-06, 2021	Prague, ELECTR NETWORK	Medtronic, Blackrock Microsystems, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Inst Italiano Tecnologia, Biorobot Inst, Sant Anna Sch Adv Studies, Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Wearable Robot, Frontiers Neuroscience, EPFL, Elsevier, CorTec, Abbott, Univ Pittsburgh, IEEE Transact Neural Syst & Rehabilitat Engn, IEEE Open Journal Engn Med & Biol			EEG	A primary challenge to make motor-imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) technologies usable and actually used out-of-the-lab consists of providing EEG systems that are efficient in terms of classification accuracy- and easy to install, e.g., using a minimal number of dry electrodes. We hypothesize that the optimal signal processing method might depend on the number of (dry) electrodes that are used. Therefore, we compared for the first time the classification accuracy associated with different dry electrode setups, i.e., 7 configurations from 8 to 32 channels, and various signal processing methods, namely (1) regularized Common Spatial Pattern (rCSP) + Linear Discriminant Analysis, (2) rCSP + Support Vector Machine (SVM), (3) Minimum Distance to Riemannian Mean and (4) SVM in the Riemannian Tangent Space. This offline comparison was performed on the data of 10 participants (one session each). Our results suggest that for all methods. MI-BCI performance drops significantly for 8 and 12 channels ( p < 0:01). Moreover, method 3 was associated with the lowest performances (p < 0:05). Finally, post-doc analyses suggest that methods 1 and 2 perform best with the highest numbers of electrodes 28 and 32. For method 4 the best performance is obtained using 20 and 24 channels, which seems to be the optimal combination (p < 0:05). These results show the importance of selecting the signal processing pipeline as a function of the location and number of the electrodes.

Methods: In this study, to improve the kinematic estimation of an EMG-based decoder during goal-directed reaching movements, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were considered to identify the motion target. The EMG signal of the shoulder and arm muscles was mapped to the elbow angle with a model selected by SSVEP signals during the reaching movement to a flashing target on display. Results: The accuracy of decoding based on the combination of EMG and EEG was significantly different (RMSE = 3.7 degrees and R2 = 92.13%) from the counterpart EMG-based decoder (RMSE = 4.26 degrees and R2 = 91.02%). Indeed, the proposed dual-modality structure outperformed the single-modality structure when the EMG signals altered in permanent conditions, such as spinal cord injury or stroke. Especially in simulated muscle weakness situations where the signal-to-noise ratio declines, the dual-modality framework was more robust than the single-modality, and the determinant coefficient of the decoder was stable above 80%. Conclusion: Because of the additional EEG information to recognize the target of reaching, the performance of the EMG-based decoding improved and could be more robust during EMG signal alterations. The outcomes of this study can be applied to control HMIs or evaluate real-time rehabilitation trials, particularly for severe motor injury patients.

In this paper, we review the physical principles of BCIs, and underlying novel approaches for registration, analysis, and control of brain activity. We analyze recent advances in BCI studies focusing on their applications for (i) controlling the movement of robots and exoskeletons, (ii) revealing and preventing brain pathologies, (iii) assessing and controlling psychophysiological states, and (iv) monitoring and controlling normal and pathological cognitive activity. We consider the BCI as a hardware/software communication system that allows interaction of humans or animals with their surroundings without the involvement of peripheral nerves and muscles, using control signals generated from brain cerebral activity. Classifying BCIs into three main types (active, reactive and passive), we describe their functional models and neuroimaging methods, as well as novel techniques for signal enhancement and artifact recognition and avoidance, to improve BCI performance in real time. We also review different BCI applications, including communications, external device control, movement control, neuroprostheses, and assessment of human psychophysiological states. Then, we describe the most common techniques for the analysis and classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Special attention is paid to modern technology based on machine learning and reservoir computing. We discuss main results on the creation and application of BCIs based on invasive and noninvasive EEG recordings. First, we consider neurointerfaces for controlling the movement of robots and exoskeletons. Second, we describe BCIs for diagnosis and control of pathological brain activity, in particular, epilepsy. We also discuss the results on the development of invasive BCIs for predicting and mitigating absence epileptic seizures. After that, we focus on passive neurointerfaces for assessing and controlling a person's psychophysiological states and cognitive activity. Special attention is given to optogenetic brain interfaces using photostimulation to deliver intervention to specificcell types. We outline the basic principles of optogenetic neurocontrol and extracellular electrophysiology recording. We also describe the state-of-the-art of miniaturized closed-loop optogenetic devices to control normal and pathological brain activities. Further, we discuss the new emerging technological trend in the BCI development which consists in using neurointerfaces to improve the interaction between people, so-called brain-to-brain interfaces (BBIs). Such interfaces can increase the efficiency of collaborative processes when working in a group. We propose a BBI which distributes a cognitive load among all team members working on a common task. This BBI allows sharing the workload among the participants according to their current cognitive performance, estimated from their electrical brain activity. The novel results of the brain-to-brain interaction are promising for the development of a new generation of communication systems based on the neurophysiological brain activity of interacting persons, where the BBI estimates physical conditions of each partner and adapts the assigned task accordingly. Finally, we trace the main historical epochs in BCI development and applications and highlight possible future directions for this research area, including hybrid BCIs.

These systems aim to prevent accidents that patients may experience caused by the loss of consciousness during seizures. Therefore, patients must use real-time epileptic seizure prediction systems that do not interfere with their daily activities. In this study, using the unipolar EEG data from a surface electrode, a patient-specific estimation system is implemented in real-time on a system on chip (SoC) that contains an embedded processor and programmable logic blocks. The European epilepsy database EPILEPSIAE is used in the scope of this work. In the proposed system, pre-processing is applied to the EEG data. Then, the features of the data in the frequency domain are extracted. The classifier model is trained with the RusBoosted Tree cluster classifier, which is a machine learning algorithm. Testing is carried out using the proposed classification model. Threshold values are determined, and then false alarms and erroneous classifications are prevented by post-processing. At the end of the tests, prediction success, sensitivity (SEN), Specificity (SPE), False Prediction Rate (FPR), and prediction times are obtained as 77.30%, 95.94%, 0.041 h(-1), and 33.23 min, respectively. The proposed system outperforms other studies in the literature in the number of electrodes, real-time operation, hardware/software architecture, and FPR performance. A wearable seizure prediction system seems to be commercialized according to the results achieved in this study.

The procedures are time-consuming, burdensome, and prone to human error. This urgently necessitates the development of an effective and precise computer-aided design for the detection of SZ. One such efficient source for SZ detection is the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Because EEG signals are non-stationary, it is challenging to find representative information in its raw form. Decomposing the signals into multi-modes can provide detailed insight information from it. But the choice of uniform decomposition and hyper-parameters leads to information loss affecting system performance drastically. Method: In this paper, automatic signal decomposition and classification methods are proposed for the detection of SZ and healthy control EEG signals. The Fisher score method is used for the selection of the most discriminant channel. Flexible tunable Q wavelet transform (F-TQWT) is developed for efficient decomposition of EEG signals by reducing root mean square error with grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Five features are extracted from the adaptively generated subbands and selected by the Kruskal Wallis test. The feature matrix is given as an input to the flexible least square support vector machine (F-LSSVM) classifier. The hyper-parameters and kernel of classifier are selected such that the accuracy of each subband is maximized using GWO algorithm. Results: The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method is tested by evaluating seven performance parameters. An accuracy of 91.39%, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-1 measure, false positive rate and error of 92.65%, 93.22%, 95.57%, 0.9306, 6.78% and 8.61% is achieved. The results prove superiority of the developed F-TQWT decomposition and F-LSSVM classifier over existing methodologies. Conclusion: The EEG signals of healthy control and SZ subjects performing motor and auditory tasks simultaneously provide higher discrimination ability over the subjects performing auditory and motory tasks separately. The developed model is accurate, robust, and effective as it is developed on a relatively larger data-set, obtained maximum performance, and tested using ten-fold cross-validation technique. This proposed model is ready to be put to test for real-time SZ detection. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Motor imagery (MI), based on the theory of mirror neurons and neuroplasticity, can promote motor cortical activation in neurorehabilitation. The strategy of MI based on brain-computer interface (BCI) has been used in rehabilitation training and daily assistance for patients with hemiplegia in recent years. However, it is difficult to maintain the consistency and timeliness of receiving external stimulation to neural activation in most subjects owing to the high variability of electroencephalogram (EEG) representation across trials/subjects. Moreover, in practical application, MI-BCI cannot highly activate the motor cortex and provide stable interaction owing to the weakness of the EEG feature and lack of an effective mode of activation. Approach. In this study, a novel hybrid BCI paradigm based on MI and vestibular stimulation motor imagery (VSMI) was proposed to enhance the capability of feature response for MI. Twelve subjects participated in a group of controlled experiments containing VSMI and MI. Three indicators, namely, activation degree, timeliness, and classification accuracy, were adopted to evaluate the performance of the task. Main results. Vestibular stimulation could significantly strengthen the suppression of alpha and beta bands of contralateral brain regions during MI, that is, enhance the activation degree of the motor cortex (p< 0.01). Compared with MI, the timeliness of EEG feature-response achieved obvious improvements in VSMI experiments. Moreover, the averaged classification accuracy of VSMI and MI was 80.56% and 69.38%, respectively. Significance. The experimental results indicate that specific vestibular activity contributes to the oscillations of the motor cortex and has a positive effect on spontaneous imagery, which provides a novel MI paradigm and enables the preliminary exploration of sensorimotor integration of MI.

However, its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear, hindering the development of new therapies. Changes in brain connectivity are related to cognitive impairment in patients with PD, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) being considered the essential region related to PD cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the global connectivity responsible for communication with the DLPFC node, the posterior division of the middle frontal gyrus (PMFG) in patients with PD; this was the focus of this study. Methods We applied resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and calculated a reliable functional connectivity measurement, the debiased weighted phase lag index (dWPLI), to examine inter-regional functional connectivity in 68 patients with PD who were classified into two groups according to their cognitive condition. Results We observed that altered left and right PMFG-based functional connectivity associated with cognitive impairment in patients with PD in the theta frequency bands under the eyes closed condition (r = -0.426, p < 0.001 and r = -0.437, p < 0.001, respectively). Exploratory results based on the MoCA subdomains indicated that poorer visuospatial function was associated with higher right PMFG-based functional connectivity (r = -0.335, p = 0.005), and poorer attention function was associated with higher left and right PMFG-based functional connectivity (r = -0.380, p = 0.001 and r = -0.256, p = 0.035, respectively). Further analysis using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves found that this abnormal functional connectivity was an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment [odds ratio (OR): 2.949, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.294-6.725, p = 0.01 for left PMFG; OR: 11.278, 95% CI: 2.578-49.335, p = 0.001 for right PMFG, per 0.1 U], and provided moderate classification power to discriminate between cognitive abilities in patients with PD [area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.770 for left PMFG; AUC = 0.809 for right PMFG]. Conclusion These preliminary findings indicate that abnormal PMFG-based functional connectivity patterns associated with cognitive impairment in the theta frequency bands under the eyes closed condition and altered functional connectivity patterns have the potential to act as reliable biomarkers for identifying cognitive impairment in patients with PD.

Choosing anti-seizure medications (ASMs) is subject to trial and error. About one-third of patients have drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Surgery may be considered for selected patients, but time from diagnosis to surgery averages 20 years. We reviewed the potential use of machine learning (ML) predictive models as clinical decision support tools to help address some of these issues. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of Medline and Embase of studies that investigated the application of ML in epilepsy management in terms of predicting ASM responsiveness, predicting DRE, identifying surgical candidates, and predicting epilepsy surgery outcomes. Original articles addressing these 4 areas published in English between 2000 and 2020 were included. Results: We identified 24 relevant articles: 6 on ASM responsiveness, 3 on DRE prediction, 2 on identifying surgical candidates, and 13 on predicting surgical outcomes. A variety of potential predictors were used including clinical, neuropsychological, imaging, electroencephalography, and health system claims data. A number of different ML algorithms and approaches were used for prediction, but only one study utilized deep learning methods. Some models show promising performance with areas under the curve above 0.9. However, most were single setting studies (18 of 24) with small sample sizes (median number of patients 55), with the exception of 3 studies that utilized large databases and 3 studies that performed external validation. There was a lack of standardization in reporting model performance. None of the models reviewed have been prospectively evaluated for their clinical benefits. Conclusion: The utility of ML models for clinical decision support in epilepsy management remains to be determined. Future research should be directed toward conducting larger studies with external validation, standardization of reporting, and prospective evaluation of the ML model on patient outcomes.

In this paper bi-modal emotion detection has been used to find employee satisfaction in workplaces. Interviews were taken of employees from different workplaces and were recorded. The recorded interviews were then used to detect the emotions of the employees from which their satisfaction level was derived. From the interviews, six different entities of emotion were detected, which are: Happiness, Sadness, Neutral, Disgust, Anger and Surprise. Two separate independent neural networks have been utilised. In one the facial expressions were detected and in the other sentiment analysis was done on the speech of the interviews after converting it into text. The extracted emotions were then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for determining the satisfaction of the employees. The satisfactions were categorized into five different levels which are: Highly dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied and Highly satisfied.

Such incorporation into these human-dominated environments can raise safety concerns as most robots are not fully automated and require some sort of control mechanism. Conventional control systems may fall short under specific situations in which workers require robotic assistance but cannot use their hands to control the robot. Brain-computer interface (BCI) can offer such hands-free controllability, a non-muscular communicative channel that can establish an interpretive pathway between humans and robots. This paper proposes a BCI-based system to remotely control a robot by continuously capturing workers' brainwaves acquired from a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) device and interpreting them into robotic commands with 90% accuracy. The findings revealed the proposed system holds promise for enhancing robot control in hazardous operations where the ability of the worker to physically direct the robot is limited, such as underwater and space construction.

J	Singh, K; Singh, S; Malhotra, J				Singh, Kuldeep; Singh, Sukhjeet; Malhotra, Jyoteesh			Spectral features based convolutional neural network for accurate and prompt identification of schizophrenic patients	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; convolutional neural network; EEG; internet of things; healthcare; spectral analysis		Schizophrenia is a fatal mental disorder, which affects millions of people globally by the disturbance in their thinking, feeling and behaviour. In the age of the internet of things assisted with cloud computing and machine learning techniques, the computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia is essentially required to provide its patients with an opportunity to own a better quality of life. In this context, the present paper proposes a spectral features based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate identification of schizophrenic patients using spectral analysis of multichannel EEG signals in real-time. This model processes acquired EEG signals with filtering, segmentation and conversion into frequency domain. Then, given frequency domain segments are divided into six distinct spectral bands like delta, theta-1, theta-2, alpha, beta and gamma. The spectral features including mean spectral amplitude, spectral power and Hjorth descriptors (Activity, Mobility and Complexity) are extracted from each band. These features are independently fed to the proposed spectral features-based CNN and long short-term memory network (LSTM) models for classification. This work also makes use of raw time-domain and frequency-domain EEG segments for classification using temporal CNN and spectral CNN models of same architectures respectively. The overall analysis of simulation results of all models exhibits that the proposed spectral features based CNN model is an efficient technique for accurate and prompt identification of schizophrenic patients among healthy individuals with average classification accuracies of 94.08% and 98.56% for two different datasets with optimally small classification time.

J	Zhao, N				Zhao, Nan			Intelligent System of Somatosensory Music Therapy Information Feedback in Deep Learning Environment	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							CHILDREN	In the treatment of children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) through music perception, the perception effect and the development of the disease are mainly reflected in the fluctuations of the electroencephalogram (EEG), which is clinically effective on the brain. There is an inaccuracy problem in electrogram judgment, and deep learning has great advantages in signal feature extraction and classification. Based on the theoretical basis of Deep Belief Network (DBN) in deep learning, this paper proposes a method that combines the optimized Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) feature extraction model with the softmax classification algorithm. Brain wave tracking analysis is performed on children with autism who have received different music perception treatments to improve classification accuracy and achieve the purpose of accurately judging the condition. Through continuous adjustment and optimization of the weight matrix in the model, a stable recognition model is obtained. The simulation results show that this optimization algorithm can effectively improve the recognition performance of DBN, with an accuracy of 94% in a certain environment, and has a better classification effect than other traditional classification methods.

J	Xu, YL; Huang, X; Lan, Q				Xu, Yilu; Huang, Xin; Lan, Quan			Selective Cross-Subject Transfer Learning Based on Riemannian Tangent Space for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transfer learning; cross-subject; source selection; Riemannian tangent space; motor imagery	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; EEG	A motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) plays an important role in the neurological rehabilitation training for stroke patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based MI BCI has high temporal resolution, which is convenient for real-time BCI control. Therefore, we focus on EEG-based MI BCI in this paper. The identification of MI EEG signals is always quite challenging. Due to high inter-session/subject variability, each subject should spend long and tedious calibration time in collecting amounts of labeled samples for a subject-specific model. To cope with this problem, we present a supervised selective cross-subject transfer learning (sSCSTL) approach which simultaneously makes use of the labeled samples from target and source subjects based on Riemannian tangent space. Since the covariance matrices representing the multi-channel EEG signals belong to the smooth Riemannian manifold, we perform the Riemannian alignment to make the covariance matrices from different subjects close to each other. Then, all aligned covariance matrices are converted into the Riemannian tangent space features to train a classifier in the Euclidean space. To investigate the role of unlabeled samples, we further propose semi-supervised and unsupervised versions which utilize the total samples and unlabeled samples from target subject, respectively. Sequential forward floating search (SFFS) method is executed for source selection. All our proposed algorithms transfer the labeled samples from most suitable source subjects into the feature space of target subject. Experimental results on two publicly available MI datasets demonstrated that our algorithms outperformed several state-of-the-art algorithms using small number of the labeled samples from target subject, especially for good target subjects.

J	Jessen, S; Obleser, J; Tune, S				Jessen, Sarah; Obleser, Jonas; Tune, Sarah			Neural tracking in infants-An analytical tool for multisensory social processing in development	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Infancy; Encoding models; Decoding models; Temporal response function; Neural tracking	AUDITORY-CORTEX; SPEECH; REPRESENTATION; MODELS	Humans are born into a social environment and from early on possess a range of abilities to detect and respond to social cues. In the past decade, there has been a rapidly increasing interest in investigating the neural responses underlying such early social processes under naturalistic conditions. However, the investigation of neural responses to continuous dynamic input poses the challenge of how to link neural responses back to continuous sensory input. In the present tutorial, we provide a step-by-step introduction to one approach to tackle this issue, namely the use of linear models to investigate neural tracking responses in electroencephalographic (EEG) data. While neural tracking has gained increasing popularity in adult cognitive neuroscience over the past decade, its application to infant EEG is still rare and comes with its own challenges. After introducing the concept of neural tracking, we discuss and compare the use of forward vs. backward models and individual vs. generic models using an example data set of infant EEG data. Each section comprises a theoretical introduction as well as a concrete example using MATLAB code. We argue that neural tracking provides a promising way to investigate early (social) processing in an ecologically valid setting.

J	Damsma, A; Schlichting, N; van Rijn, H				Damsma, Atser; Schlichting, Nadine; van Rijn, Hedderik			Temporal Context Actively Shapes EEG Signatures of Time Perception	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian perception; context; EEG; time perception	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; BETA OSCILLATIONS; CNV; MOTOR; DURATION; PERSPECTIVE; ADAPTATION; TUTORIAL	Our subjective perception of time is optimized to temporal regularities in the environment. This is illustrated by the central tendency effect: When estimating a range of intervals, short intervals are overestimated, whereas long intervals are underestimated to reduce the overall estimation error. Most models of interval timing ascribe this effect to the weighting of the current interval with previous memory traces after the interval has been perceived. Alternatively, the perception of the duration could already be flexibly tuned to its temporal context. We investigated this hypothesis using an interval reproduction task in which human participants (both sexes) reproduced a shorter and longer interval range. As expected, reproductions were biased toward the subjective mean of each presented range. EEG analyses showed that temporal context indeed affected neural dynamics during the perception phase. Specifically, longer previous durations decreased contingent negative variation and P2 amplitude and increased beta power. In addition, multivariate pattern analysis showed that it is possible to decode context from the transient EEG signal quickly after both onset and offset of the perception phase. Together, these results suggest that temporal context creates dynamic expectations which actively affect the perception of duration.

Moreover, the interictal language profile in these patients is heterogeneous, varying from normal language profile to impairment in different language functions. The aim of this paper was to critically review the terms and concepts of ictal language alterations. Material and method: For this review we performed an extensive literature search on the term "epileptic aphasia" and analyzed the semiology and terminology indicating language-associated seizure symptoms. In addition, we give an overview on EEG, etiology, and brain imaging findings and ictal language disorders. Results: In the literature, a plethora of terms indicates language-associated seizure symptoms. Simultaneous Video-EEG monitoring represents the gold standard to correctly classify ictal versus postictal language disturbances and to differentiate aphasic symptoms from speech automatisms. Different rhythmic and periodic EEG patterns associated with ictal language disturbances are recognized. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) is essential in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy. Brain tumors and acute or remote cerebrovascular lesions are the most frequently reported structural etiologies underlying ictal language alterations. However, it has to be recognized that brain imaging may show alterations being the consequence of seizures itself rather than its cause. Functional brain imaging might be informative in patients with inconclusive EEG and MRI findings. Overall, seizure-associated aphasia is reported to have good lateralizing significance. Conclusion: Various language disturbances are caused by different types of seizures, epilepsies and underlying etiologies. In the clinical context, simultaneous Video-EEG monitoring facilitates precise classification of ictal versus postictal language alterations and differentiation of aphasic symptoms from speech automatisms.

Relatively little work has been conducted on multi-biological data for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. In this cross-sectional study, we extracted multiple features from three types of biological data, including gut microbiota data, blood data, and electroencephalogram data. Then, an integrated framework of machine learning consisting of five classifiers, three feature selection algorithms, and four cross validation methods was used to discriminate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls. Our results show that the support vector machine classifier without feature selection using the input features of multi-biological data achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 91.7% and an AUC of 96.5% (p<0.05). These results indicate that multi-biological data showed better discriminative capacity for patients with schizophrenia than single biological data. The top 5% discriminative features selected from the optimal model include the gut microbiota features (Lactobacillus, Haemophilus, and Prevotella), the blood features (superoxide dismutase level, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil count), and the electroencephalogram features (nodal local efficiency, nodal efficiency, and nodal shortest path length in the temporal and frontal-parietal brain areas). The proposed integrated framework may be helpful for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and developing biomarkers for schizophrenia using multi-biological data.

The healthcare industry produces a huge amount of digital data, by utilizing information from all sources of healthcare, including the patients' demographics, medications, vital signs, physician's observations, laboratory data, billing data, data from various wearable sensors, etc. With the rapid growth of the wireless technology applications, there has also been a significant increase in the digital health data. New medical discoveries and new eHealth-related technologies, such as mobile apps, novel sensors, and wearable technology have contributed as important data sources for healthcare data. Nowadays, there is a huge potential to improve the healthcare quality and customer satisfaction with the help of machine learning (ML) algorithms applied on time-domain and frequency-domain healthcare data obtained from wearables and sensors. This systematic literature review examines in depth how health data from sensors can be processed and analyzed using ML techniques. The review focuses on the following diseases for obtaining the eHealth data: diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2, hypertension and hypotension, atrial fibrillation, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and fever related diseases. The data for the systematic literature review was collected from four databases, Medline, Proquest, Scopus, and Web of Science. We selected 67 studies for the final in-depth review out of the initial 1530 pre-selected papers. Our study identified that the major part of eHealth data is obtained from the sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscopes, ECG (Electrocardiogram), EEG (Electroencephalogram) monitors, and blood glucose sensors. This study also examines the different feature types, feature extraction methods, and ML algorithms used for eHealth data analysis. Our review also shows that neural network (NN) algorithms and support vector machines (SVM) have shown so far the best performance for analyzing the healthcare data among other ML algorithms studied in the literature.

Unfortunately, the data sparsity issue violates the basic i.i.d. assumption of supervised learning (i.e., training data and test data are independently and identically distributed). In this paper, we present a semi-supervised joint domain adaption (SSJDA) solution, aiming to inject the hidden domain knowledge from ample labeled data of multiple source individuals into the target subject's customized model. Specifically, we put forward a novel Progressive Low Rank Subspace Alignment (PLRSA) approach, which unifies a semi-supervised instance-transfer paradigm and an unsupervised mapping-transfer learning paradigm in a single optimization framework. We leverage the boosting-based TrAdaBoost algorithm and the Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) algorithm for the implementation of instance reweighting and feature matching, respectively. Then we introduce the l(2,1)-norm to pass feedback and make the joint learning feasible. The central idea is to progressively minimize the cross-domain distribution discrepancies to finally construct the optimal domain-invariant features. We systematically compare the PLRSA method with five state-of-the-art techniques using two public EEG datasets (DEAP and SEED). Both many-to-one and one-to-one evaluations are performed. The experimental results have confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ko, WJ; Jeon, E; Jeong, S; Suk, HI				Ko, Wonjun; Jeon, Eunjin; Jeong, Seungwoo; Suk, Heung-Il			Multi-Scale Neural Network for EEG Representation Learning in BCI	IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE			English	Article								Recent advances in deep learning have had a methodological and practical impact on brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Among the various deep network architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been well suited for spatio-spectral-temporal electroencephalogram (EEG) signal representation learning. Most of the existing CNN-based methods described in the literature extract features at a sequential level of abstraction with repetitive nonlinear operations and involve densely connected layers for classification. However, studies in neurophysiology have revealed that EEG signals carry information in different ranges of frequency components. To better reflect these multi-frequency properties in EEGs, we propose a novel deep multi-scale neural network that discovers feature representations in multiple frequency/time ranges and extracts relationships among electrodes, i.e., spatial representations, for subject intention/condition identification. Furthermore, by completely representing EEG signals with spatio-spectral-temporal information, the proposed method can be utilized for diverse paradigms in both active and passive BCIs, contrary to existing methods that are primarily focused on single-paradigm BCIs. To demonstrate the validity of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on various paradigms of active/passive BCI datasets. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved performance improvements when judged against comparable state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we analyzed the proposed method using different techniques, such as PSD curves and relevance score inspection to validate the multi-scale EEG signal information capturing ability, activation pattern maps for investigating the learned spatial filters, and t-SNE plotting for visualizing represented features. Finally, we also demonstrated our method's application to real-world problems. Based on our experimental results and analyses, we believe that the proposed multi-scale neural network can be useful for various BCI paradigms, as a starting model or as a backbone network in any new BCI experiments.

The effective feature extraction method is considered significant for fault diagnosis. In order to extract sufficient and effective bearing information, a novel extraction method called multiscale one-dimensional hybrid pattern (1D-HBP) is proposed for fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. The proposed method extracts the local and global texture statistical information of signals to reflect different bearing conditions. Considering the inherent multi-scale characteristics of the vibration signals, multiscale analysis is employed to obtain discriminative features of different scales. Two rolling bearings sets with changeable loads and rotating speeds verified the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed diagnostic model. Compared to other models examined for the same dataset our proposed model achieves a remarkably high classification accuracy.

Since manual sleep scoring is time consuming, machine-learning based approaches have been proposed. Though efficient, these algorithms are black-box in nature and difficult to interpret by clinicians. In this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture for multi-modal sleep scoring, investigate the model?s decision making process, and compare the model?s reasoning with the annotation guidelines in the AASM manual. Our archi-tecture, called STQS, uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically extract spatio-temporal features from 3 modalities (EEG, EOG and EMG), a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) to extract sequential information, and residual connections to combine spatio-temporal and sequential features. We evaluated our model on two large datasets, obtaining an accuracy of 85% and 77% and a macro F1 score of 79% and 73% on SHHS and an in-house dataset, respectively. We further quantify the contribution of various architectural components and conclude that adding LSTM layers improves performance over a spatio-temporal CNN, while adding residual connections does not. Our interpretability results show that the output of the model is well aligned with AASM guidelines, and therefore, the model?s decisions correspond to domain knowledge. We also compare multi-modal models and single-channel models and suggest that future research should focus on improving multi-modal models.

Early diagnosis of MS is of great importance for the treatment and course of the disease. In addition to the many methods, cost-effective and non-invasive electroencephalogram signals may contribute to the pre-diagnosis of MS. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to classify male subjects who have MS and who are healthy control using photic stimulation electroencephalogram signals. Methods: Firstly the continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) method was applied to electroencephalogram signals under photic stimulation with 5Hz, 10Hz, 15Hz, 20Hz, and 25Hz frequencies. The sum, maximum, minimum and standard deviation values of absolute CWT coefficients, corresponding to "1-4 Hz" and "4-13 Hz" frequency ranges, were extracted in each stimulation frequency region. The ratios of these values obtained from the frequency ranges "1-4Hz" and "4-13Hz" was decided as features. Finally, various machine learning classifiers were evaluated to test the effectivity of determined features. Results: Consequently, the overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of the proposed algorithm were 80 %, 72.7 %, 88.9 %, and 88.9 %, respectively by using the Ensemble Subspace k-NN classifier algorithm. Conclusions: The results showed how photic stimulation electroencephalogram signals can contribute to the prediagnosis of MS.

A multi scale time-frequency analysis on Electroencephalogram signals	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Non-stationary time series; Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy; Continuous wavelet transform; Scalogram	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; SEIZURE DETECTION; EEG SIGNALS; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; ENTROPY; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CHAOS; POWER	It is well known, the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are non-stationary signals which helps us in understanding the complex brain dynamics, cognitive processes, etc. In this paper, we have analysed the healthy and Epilepsy seizure subjects through continuous wavelet transform using Morlet wavelet function. We identify the key differences between healthy and epilepsy seizure EEG signals' low frequency periodic modulations and transient time varying patterns. Persistent intermixing of alpha and beta waves is found to be a key characteristic feature of the patients. The frequency intermixing is completely absent in signals from the hippocampal formation of the opposite hemisphere of the brain for the patients without seizure, akin to the healthy subjects. Our study further reveals dominance of frequency broadened gamma waves for seizure patients as compared to the low frequency regular alpha and beta waves for the healthy subjects. The time-frequency localization of wavelet transform clearly shows transfer of power to high frequency beta waves from the low frequency alpha waves in the signals of the epileptogenic zone of the patients. The observed frequency intermixing, reported here, is analogous to the bi-stability behaviour of dynamical systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Psychostimulants have brain arousal stabilising properties evident in EEG patterns. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the stability of brain arousal regulation has prognostic value in predicting response to methylphenidate therapy in adult ADHD patients. In an open-label, single-arm, multi-centre, confirmatory trial, 121 adult ADHD patients were recruited and 112 qualified for the full analysis set. All participants received an initial dose of 20 mg extended release methylphenidate at baseline. After a titration phase of up to 4 weeks, patients remained on a weight-based target dose of extended release methylphenidate for 4 weeks. Using the Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig (VIGALL 2.1), we assessed brain arousal regulation before the treatment with methylphenidate, based on a 15-min EEG at quiet rest recorded at baseline. Using automatic stage-classification of 1 s segments, we computed the mean EEG-vigilance (indexing arousal level) and an arousal stability score (indexing arousal regulation). The primary endpoint was the association between successful therapy, defined by a 30% reduction in CAARS, and stable/unstable brain arousal. 52 patients (46%) showed an unstable brain arousal regulation of which 23% had therapy success. In the stable group, 35% had therapy success, implying an absolute difference of 12 percentage points (95% CI -5 to 29, p = 0.17) in the direction opposite to the hypothesized one. There were no new findings regarding the tolerability and safety of extended release methylphenidate therapy. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

Subjects are instructed to focus on sensation when the left or right wrist is tactile stimulated during the SS block, and they are required to perform left or right-hand imaginary movements during the MI block. The experiment paradigm involves three blocks, namely Pre-MI block, SS block, and Post-MI block. Each block contains 80 trials, and the Post-MI block is served as an evaluation block. Three calibration protocols are developed for the comparison of generalization performance. Concretely, MI calibration using trials from the Pre-MI block, SS calibration using trials from the SS block, and Mixed calibration using the first two blocks together. Four BCI naive subjects are recruited in the study. The calibration is conducted by using common spatial pattern (CSP) features with the linear support vector machine (SVM). The experiment results have shown that SS calibration can be used for MI decoding. Meanwhile, Mixed calibration yields better generalization performance compared to MI calibration. The tactile sensation-induced oscillatory dynamics are similar to the one induced by MI. The proposed Mixed calibration is a promising calibration protocol for MI decoding.

J	Xie, SK				Xie, Shengkun			Wavelet Power Spectral Domain Functional Principal Component Analysis for Feature Extraction of Epileptic EEGs	COMPUTATION			English	Article						wavelet power spectra; feature extraction; functional PCA; medical informatics; data visualization	SEIZURE DETECTION	Feature extraction plays an important role in machine learning for signal processing, particularly for low-dimensional data visualization and predictive analytics. Data from real-world complex systems are often high-dimensional, multi-scale, and non-stationary. Extracting key features of this type of data is challenging. This work proposes a novel approach to analyze Epileptic EEG signals using both wavelet power spectra and functional principal component analysis. We focus on how the feature extraction method can help improve the separation of signals in a low-dimensional feature subspace. By transforming EEG signals into wavelet power spectra, the functionality of signals is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the power spectra transformation makes functional principal component analysis suitable for extracting key signal features. Therefore, we refer to this approach as a double feature extraction method since both wavelet transform and functional PCA are feature extractors. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, we have tested it using a set of publicly available epileptic EEGs and patient-specific, multi-channel EEG signals, for both ictal signals and pre-ictal signals. The obtained results demonstrate that combining wavelet power spectra and functional principal component analysis is promising for feature extraction of epileptic EEGs. Therefore, they can be useful in computer-based medical systems for epilepsy diagnosis and epileptic seizure detection problems.

However, there are few reports addressing the value and safety of this procedure in hypothalamic hamartoma (HH). Objective: To present the results of our experience using SEEG-guided RFTC in HH patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and identify outcome predictors. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and surgical characteristics of 27 HH-related patients with epilepsy in our center between 2015 and 2019. All patients underwent invasive recordings with SEEG before RFTC was performed. We reported surgical outcome predictors and postoperative follow-up concerning safety and efficacy (mean follow-up, 27.3 months; range, 12-63). Surgical strategy was also analyzed. Results: Nineteen patients (70.4%) achieved Engel's class I outcome, while 4 patients (14.8%) did not show significant improvement. Of all observed seizures, two different onset patterns of intracranial electrophysiology recorded by SEEG were observed. Patients presented with focal low-voltage fast activity were more likely to obtain seizure freedom (p = 0.045), while classification (p = 0.478), volume (p = 0.546), history of resection ( p = 0.713), seizure types (p = 0.859), or seizure duration (p = 0.415) showed no significant effect on the outcome. Weight gain was the most common long-term complication (18.5%). Conclusion: The SEEG can guide the ablation of HH and serve as an important factor to predict favorable seizure outcomes. Radiofrequency thermocoagulation guided by SEEG can offer a minimally invasive and low-risk surgical approach with excellent outcomes. Disconnecting the attachment of HH should be the appropriate strategy to obtain the best seizure outcome. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With no cure at present, it is crucial to improve our understanding of how CNP manifests, to develop diagnostic biomarkers for drug development, and to explore prognostic biomarkers for personalised therapy. Previous work has found early evidence of diagnostic and prognostic markers analysing Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillatory features. In this paper, we explore whether non-linear non-oscillatory EEG features, specifically Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD), can be used as prognostic biomarkers to increase the repertoire of available analyses on the EEG of people with subacute SCI, where having both linear and non-linear features for classifying pain may ultimately lead to higher classification accuracy and an intrinsically transferable classifier. We focus on EEG recorded during imagined movement because of the known relation between the motor cortex over-activity and CNP. Analyses were performed on two existing datasets. The first dataset consists of EEG recordings from able-bodied participants (N = 10), participants with chronic SCI and chronic CNP (N = 10), and participants with chronic SCI and no CNP (N = 10). We tested for statistically significant differences in HFD across all pairs of groups using bootstrapping, and found significant differences between all pairs of groups at multiple electrode locations. The second dataset consists of EEG recordings from participants with subacute SCI and no CNP (N = 20). They were followed-up 6 months post recording to test for CNP, at which point (N = 10) participants had developed CNP and (N = 10) participants had not developed CNP. We tested for statistically significant differences in HFD between these two groups using bootstrapping and, encouragingly, also found significant differences at multiple electrode locations. Transferable machine learning classifiers achieved over 80% accuracy discriminating between groups of participants with chronic SCI based on only a single EEG channel as input. The most significant finding is that future and chronic CNP share common features and as a result, the same classifier can be used for both. This sheds new light on pain chronification by showing that frontal areas, involved in the affective aspects of pain and believed to be influenced by long-standing pain, are affected in a much earlier phase of pain development.</p>	[Anderson, Keri; Vuckovic, Aleksandra] Univ Glasgow, Biomed Engn Div, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Chirion, Cristian; Stein, Sebastian] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Fraser, Matthew; Purcell, Mariel] Queen Elizabeth Univ Hosp, Queen Elizabeth Natl Spinal Injuries Unit, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland		Vuckovic, A (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Biomed Engn Div, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.	aleksandra.vuckovic@glasgow.ac.uk		Anderson, Keri/0000-0002-1024-5840	MRC [G0902257/1]; EPSRC [EP/R018634/1]; Spinal Research3 PhD Award [NRB121]	MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Spinal Research3 PhD Award	This work has been supported by the MRC Grant G0902257/1, EPSRC Grant EP/R018634/1: Closed-Loop Data Science for Complex, Computationally-and Data-Intensive Analytics, and the Spinal Research3 PhD Award NRB121: Electroencephalograph Predictors of Central Neuropathic Pain in Subacute Spinal Cord Injury postgraduate.		44	1	1	3	7	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND		1662-453X		FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ	Front.

Recent developments in sensor technologies, hardware computational capabilities, and neural network models have significantly helped advance biomedical signal processing research. This study is an attempt to utilize state-of-the-art resources to explore the relationship between human behavioral responses during perceptual decision-making and corresponding brain signals in the form of electroencephalograms (EEC). In this paper, a generalized 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is introduced to estimate RT for a simple visual task using single-trial multi-channel EEC. Earlier comparable studies have also employed a number of machine learning and deep learning-based models, but none of them considered inter-channel relationships while estimating RT. On the contrary, the use of 3D convolutional layers enabled us to consider the spatial relationship among adjacent channels while simultaneously utilizing spectral information from individual channels. Our model can predict RT with a root mean square error of 91.5 ms and a correlation coefficient of 0.83. These results surpass all the previous results attained from different studies.

To this end, semantic congruencies were manipulated in Chinese classifier-noun phrases, resulting in four conditions: (i) a strongly constraining/high-cloze, plausible (SP) condition, (ii) a weakly constraining/low-cloze, plausible (WP) condition, (iii) a strongly constraining/implausible (SI) condition, and (iv) a weakly constraining/implausible (WI) condition. The analysis of EEG data focused on two event-related potential components, i.e., the N400, which is known for its sensitivity to semantic fit of a target word to its context, and a post-N400 late positive complex (LPC), which is linked to semantic integration after prediction violations and retrospective, evaluative processes. We found similar N400/LPC effects in response to the manipulations of semantic congruency in the mono- and bilingual groups, with a gradient N400 pattern (WI/SI > WP > SP), a larger frontal LPC in response to WP compared to SP, SI, and WI, as well as larger centro-parietal LPCs in response to WP compared to SI and WI, and a larger centro-parietal LPC for SP compared to SI. These results suggest that, in terms of event-related potential (ERP) data, Chinese-Malay early bilingual speakers predict and integrate upcoming semantic information in Chinese classifier-noun phrase to the same extent as monolingual Chinese speakers. However, the global field power (GFP) data showed significant differences between SP and WP in the N400 and LPC time windows in bilinguals, whereas no such effects were observed in monolinguals. This finding was interpreted as showing that bilinguals differ from their monolingual peers in terms of global field power intensity of the brain by processing plausible classifier-noun pairs with different congruency effects.

We present and evaluate a novel method for the manual annotation of in-bed periods in accelerometer data using the open-source software Audacity(R), and we compare the method to the EEG-based sleep monitoring device Zmachine(R) Insight+ and self-reported sleep diaries. For evaluating the manual annotation method, we calculated the inter- and intra-rater agreement and agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries using interclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. Our results showed excellent inter- and intra-rater agreement and excellent agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries. The Bland-Altman limits of agreement were generally around +/- 30 min for the comparison between the manual annotation and the Zmachine timestamps for the in-bed period. Moreover, the mean bias was minuscule. We conclude that the manual annotation method presented is a viable option for annotating in-bed periods in accelerometer data, which will further qualify datasets without labeling or sleep records.

In the era of digital medicine and precision therapeutics, new personalized treatment approaches are warranted for depression. Here, we use a combination of longitudinal ecological momentary assessments of depression, neurocognitive sampling synchronized with electroencephalography, and lifestyle data from wearables to generate individualized predictions of depressed mood over a 1-month time period. This study, thus, develops a systematic pipeline for N-of-1 personalized modeling of depression using multiple modalities of data. In the models, we integrate seven types of supervised machine learning (ML) approaches for each individual, including ensemble learning and regression-based methods. All models were verified using fourfold nested cross-validation. The best-fit as benchmarked by the lowest mean absolute percentage error, was obtained by a different type of ML model for each individual, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all strategy. The voting regressor, which is a composite strategy across ML models, was best performing on-average across subjects. However, the individually selected best-fit models still showed significantly less error than the voting regressor performance across subjects. For each individual's best-fit personalized model, we further extracted top-feature predictors using Shapley statistics. Shapley values revealed distinct feature determinants of depression over time for each person ranging from co-morbid anxiety, to physical exercise, diet, momentary stress and breathing performance, sleep times, and neurocognition. In future, these personalized features can serve as targets for a personalized ML-guided, multimodal treatment strategy for depression.

Their acquired expertise or professionalization is expected to help in the development of those recurring tasks. Media professionals spend their daily work watching narrative contents on screens, so learning how they manage visual perception of those contents could be of interest in an increasingly audiovisual society. Media works require not only the understanding of the storytelling, but also the decoding of the formal rules and presentations. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 36 participants (18 media professionals and 18 non-media professionals) while they were watching audiovisual contents, and compared their eyeblink rate and their brain activity and connectivity. We found that media professionals decreased their blink rate after the cuts, suggesting that they can better manage the loss of visual information that blinks entail by sparing them when new visual information is being presented. Cuts triggered similar activation of basic brain processing in the visual cortex of the two groups, but different processing in medial and frontal cortical areas, where media professionals showed a lower activity. Effective brain connectivity occurred in a more organized way in media professionals-possibly due to a better communication between cortical areas that are coordinated for decoding new visual content after cuts.

It captures the electrical activity in the brain, which enables the neurologist to look for the presence of epileptiform patterns for which brain waves (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma) are studied thoroughly. The Delta (0-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), and Alpha (8- < 13 Hz) waves are interpreted visually with proficiency; however, the interpretation of Beta (13-35 Hz) and Gamma (36-44 Hz) presents a grave challenge because of their high-frequency nature. The objective of this study was to find out if these waves incorporate features essential for the identification of inter-ictal activity. The bandpass filter was used to extract beta and gamma frequency from the complete EEG signal. Five nonlinear features were extracted out from two, and four-second segments of Beta and Gamma waves. Bagged Tree Classifier is used to categorize the segments into controlled and inter-ictal activity. Data from a total of forty-two patients were used in this study; twenty-three patients with different types of epilepsy and nineteen controlled patients. For two-second segments, we achieved 91.3% classification accuracy, and for four-second segments, we achieved 93.1%. This is improvement from the previous work available in the literature where the segment length of 23.6 s has been used by researchers; with respect to use of public data. Also, the contribution of these brain waves have not been studied independently.

Numerous BCIs have been developed to reconstruct different aspects of speech, such as phonemes and words, from brain activity. However, many challenges remain toward the successful reconstruction of continuous speech from brain activity during speech imagery. Here, we investigate the potential of differentiating speech and non-speech using intracranial brain activity in different frequency bands acquired by stereotactic EEG. The results reveal statistically significant information in the alpha and theta bands for detecting voice activity, and that using a combination of multiple frequency bands further improves performance with over 92% accuracy. Furthermore, the model is causal and can be implemented with low-latency for future closed-loop experiments. These preliminary findings show the potential of cross-frequency brain signal features for detecting speech activity to enhance speech decoding and synthesis models.	[Soroush, P. Z.; Krusienski, D.

We hypothesize that modelling sleep automatically as continuous and dynamic process predicts healthy ageing better than traditional scoring. Methods: Sleep electroencephalography of 15 young healthy subjects (aged <= 40 years) was used to train the modelling method. Each 3-s sleep mini-epoch was modelled as a probabilistic combination of wakefulness, light and deep sleep. For 79 healthy sleepers (aged 20-77 years), 15 sleep features were derived from manual traditional scoring (manual features), 7 from the automatic modelling (automatic features) and 24 from a combination of automatic modelling with traditional scoring (combined features). Age was predicted with seven multiple linear regression models with i) manual, ii) automatic, iii) combined, iv) manual + automatic, v) manual + combined, vi) automatic + combined, and vii) manual + automatic + combined sleep features. Using the same seven sleep feature groups, two support vector machine and one random forest classifiers were used to discriminate younger (aged <47 years) from older subjects with fivefold cross-validation. Adjusted coefficients of determination (adj-R-2) and average validation accuracy (ACC) were used to compare the linear models and the classifiers. Results: The linear model and the classifiers using only manual features achieved the lowest values of adjusted coefficient of determination and classification validation accuracy (adj-R-2 = 0.295, ACC = 63.00% +/- 16.22%) compared to the ones using automatic (adj-R-2 = 0.354, ACC = 65.83% +/- 9.39%), combined (adj-R-2 = 0.321, ACC = 63.42% +/- 8.78%), manual + automatic (adj-R-2 = 0.416, ACC = 67.00% +/- 8.60%), manual + combined (adj-R-2 = 0.355, ACC = 72.17% +/- 12.90%), automatic + combined (adj-R-2 = 0.448, ACC = 65.92% +/- 7.97%), and manual + automatic + combined sleep features (adj-R-2 = 0.464, ACC = 70.92% +/- 10.33%). Conclusions: Continuous and dynamic sleep modelling captures healthy ageing better than traditional sleep scoring. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Researchers have proposed many MTS classification models over the years and the distance-based methods along with nearest neighbor classifier achieve good performance. However, the current methods mainly focus on defining distance metric on time-domain of MTS and ignore frequency information. Besides, these methods usually define the same linear distance metric for different datasets, which is not suitable for capturing the nonlinear relationship of MTS and degrades the discriminative power of the distance metric. In this paper, we propose a time- frequency deep metric learning (TFDM) approach for MTS classification. The multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition is first adopted to decompose an MTS into a group of sub-MTS so as to extract multilevel time-frequency representations. Then, a deep convolutional neural network is developed for each level to learn level-specific nonlinear features and a metric learning layer is added on the top of the network to learn the semantic similarity of MTS. Moreover, a cross-level consistency regularization term is designed to encourage the distance metrics of different levels to be consistent for capturing the correlations among different levels.

J	Chen, LC; Swee, SK; Chiang, TS				Chen, Lim Choon; Swee, Sim Kok; Chiang, Tan Shing			Assessment of Stroke Severity Level Using EMG, EEG and ECG for Virtual Rehabilitation	ENGINEERING LETTERS			English	Article						EMG; EEG; ECG; Stroke Severity Level; Virtual Rehabilitation	CLASSIFICATION	Stroke is a popular disease that brings concern to medical experts around the world. Thus, assessment of the stroke severity level is essential to make sure that the physiotherapists can assign the patients to suitable rehabilitation training. In this paper, stroke severity level of the stroke patients can be determined by using the combination of electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The EMG, EEG and ECG signals will go through signal process to eliminate the unnecessary features of the signal. The power spectrums and frequencies of each biosignal are computed. The calculated outcome will be inserted into a matrix equation to compute a stroke vector (s) for determining the severity level of the patient. The stroke vector will be used to assign the patient with the appropriate virtual rehabilitation training. Two virtual rehabilitation training, which are 'Pick & Place' and 'Stone Breaker', are included in a program for stroke rehabilitation. This virtual rehabilitation program is useful to assist in the restoration of upper limb motor and fingers motor of stroke patients. A total of 40 stroke patients had joined the research study. 30 of them were recruited to join the biosignals testing for the formation of stroke vector equation using machine learning. Another 10 patients were assigned for the result testing of the developed system. The result had shown that the designed framework could effectively assign the patients to suitable virtual rehabilitation training through the stroke vector calculation. Besides, the stroke assessment system had achieved a high accuracy of 96.67% in determining the stroke severity level of stroke patients. By using the computerized stroke assessment method, it enhances the accuracy in the assessment of stroke severity level.

J	Li, MA; Wang, RT; Wei, LN				Li, Ming-Ai; Wang, Ruo-Tu; Wei, Li-Na			Fuzzy support vector machine with joint optimization of genetic algorithm and fuzzy c-means	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Motor imagery electroencephalogram; fuzzy c-means; genetic algorithm; fuzzy support vector machine; joint optimization	ENTROPY; PATTERNS; DOMAIN	BACKGROUND: Motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) play an important role in the field of neurorehabilitation, and a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is one of the most used classifiers. Specifically, a fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm was used to membership calculation to deal with the classification problems with outliers or noises. However, FCM is sensitive to its initial value and easily falls into local optima. OBJECTIVE: The joint optimization of genetic algorithm (GA) and FCM is proposed to enhance robustness of fuzzy memberships to initial cluster centers, yielding an improved FSVM (GF-FSVM). METHOD: The features of each channel of MI-EEG are extracted by the improved refined composite multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy and fused to form a feature vector for a trial. Then, GA is employed to optimize the initial cluster center of FCM, and the fuzzy membership degrees are calculated through an iterative process and further applied to classify two-class MI-EEGs. RESULTS: Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets, the average recognition accuracies achieve 99.89% and 98.81% and the corresponding kappa values are 0.9978 and 0.9762, respectively. CONCLUSION: The optimized cluster centers of FCM via GA are almost overlapping, showing great stability, and GF-FSVM obtains higher classification accuracies and higher consistency as well.

J	Buerkle, A; Bamber, T; Lohse, N; Ferreira, P				Buerkle, Achim; Bamber, Thomas; Lohse, Niels; Ferreira, Pedro			Feasibility of Detecting Potential Emergencies in Symbiotic Human-Robot Collaboration with a mobile EEG	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article						EEG; Emergency Detection; Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC); Machine Learning		Manufacturing challenges are driving the move from separated workspaces of either humans or robots towards a close, symbiotic collaboration. Symbiotic Human-Robot Collaboration requires both parties to not only share the same workspace, but to also perform tasks simultaneously. This raises questions of mutual awareness, for which safety is a critical factor. Despite advances regarding safety systems, human sensing abilities combined with the intelligence to anticipate potential emergencies cannot be matched. Subsequently, the human operator remains in a critical role regarding safety in Human-Robot Collaboration However, in a collaborative environment humans are expected to use their hands towards the completion of a task. Therefore, in order to achieve resilience for collaborative tasks, there is a need to have a hands free detection mechanism for unforeseen events. This work investigates a human sensor-based emergency stop interface that reacts once the human operator senses or anticipates a potential emergency. A novel approach is presented on how a mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to detect potential emergencies in Human-Robot Collaboration. An experiment was conducted with 21 participants, ten assembly tasks and three different kinds of potential emergencies. The potential emergencies included the collaborative robot to drop an assembly workpiece, to crush the assembly piece on the worktable, and to perform a simulated malfunction. The EEG data suggests strong similarities in the patterns between the different types of potential emergencies. High accuracies were be achieved with a Decision Tree Model based on Continuous Wavelet Transform peak counting. To optimize detection time, different detection window sizes were compared. The results showed a promising potential of this approach, which it is not intended to replace current safety systems but to enhance them towards a safer and thus symbiotic Collaboration.

Assembly processes are required to adapt in order to meet the requirements of increased product complexity and constant variant updates. A concept to meet challenges within this trend, is a close collaboration between human workers and robots. Currently, in order to protect human operators, there are barriers and restrictions in place which prevent close collaboration. This is due to safety systems being mostly reactive, rather than anticipating motions or intentions. There are probabilistic models, which aim to overcome these limitations, yet predicting human behavior remains highly complex. Thus, it would be desirable to physically measure movement intentions in advance. A novel approach is presented of how upper-limb movement intentions can be measured with a mobile electroencephalogram (EEG). The human brain constantly analyses and evaluates motor movements up to 0.5 s before their execution. A safety system could therefore be enhanced to have an early warning of an upcoming movement. In order to classify the EEG-signals as fast as possible and to minimize fine-tuning efforts, a novel data processing methodology is introduced. This includes TimeSeriesKMeans labelling of movement intentions, which is then used to train a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN). The results suggested high detection accuracies and potential time gains of up to 513 ms to be achieved in a semi-online system. Thus, the time advantages included in a simulation demonstrated the potential to increase a system?s reaction time and therefore improve the safety and the fluency of Human-Robot Collaboration.

In this paper, an open-source software toolbox called MindLink-Eumpy is developed to recognize emotions by integrating electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial expression information. MindLink-Eumpy first applies a series of tools to automatically obtain physiological data from subjects and then analyzes the obtained facial expression data and EEG data, respectively, and finally fuses the two different signals at a decision level. In the detection of facial expressions, the algorithm used by MindLink-Eumpy is a multitask convolutional neural network (CNN) based on transfer learning technique. In the detection of EEG, MindLink-Eumpy provides two algorithms, including a subject-dependent model based on support vector machine (SVM) and a subject-independent model based on long short-term memory network (LSTM). In the decision-level fusion, weight enumerator and AdaBoost technique are applied to combine the predictions of SVM and CNN. We conducted two offline experiments on the Database for Emotion Analysis Using Physiological Signals (DEAP) dataset and the Multimodal Database for Affect Recognition and Implicit Tagging (MAHNOB-HCI) dataset, respectively, and conducted an online experiment on 15 healthy subjects. The results show that multimodal methods outperform single-modal methods in both offline and online experiments. In the subject-dependent condition, the multimodal method achieved an accuracy of 71.00% in the valence dimension and an accuracy of 72.14% in the arousal dimension. In the subject-independent condition, the LSTM-based method achieved an accuracy of 78.56% in the valence dimension and an accuracy of 77.22% in the arousal dimension. The feasibility and efficiency of MindLink-Eumpy for emotion recognition is thus demonstrated.

The purpose of this study is to confirm that citation network analysis and text mining for bibliographic information analysis can be used for horizon scanning of the rapidly developing field of AI-based medical technologies and extract the latest research trend information from the field. We classified 119,553 publications obtained from SCI constructed with the keywords "conventional," "machine-learning," or "deep-learning" and grouped them into 36 clusters, which demonstrated the academic landscape of AI applications. We also confirmed that one or two close clusters included the key articles on AI-based medical image analysis, suggesting that clusters specific to the technology were appropriately formed. Significant research progress could be detected as a quick increase in constituent papers and the number of citations of hub papers in the cluster. Then we tracked recent research trends by re-analyzing "young" clusters based on the average publication year of the constituent papers of each cluster. The latest topics in AI-based medical technologies include electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms (ECG/EEG), human activity recognition, natural language processing of clinical records, and drug discovery. We could detect rapid increase in research activity of AI-based ECG/EEG a few years prior to the issuance of the draft guidance by US-FDA. Our study showed that a citation network analysis and text mining of scientific papers can be a useful objective tool for horizon scanning of rapidly developing AI-based medical technologies.

MRCP is not easy to be detected on sensors due to the volume conduction effect. This work combines the scout EEG source imaging (ESI) and Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier to detect MRCP of motor imagery and execution. Seven healthy subjects participated in this study and performed cue-based ballistic dorsiflexion. Our results showed that the source domain-based method achieved a significantly higher true positive rate (TPR) than that obtained from the sensor domain in both motor imagery (MI) (76.65 +/- 4.26% vs. 70.3 +/- 5.4%) and motor execution (ME) (81.66 +/- 2.55% vs. 74.49 +/- 6.48%) tasks. The false-positive rate (FPR) calculated in the source or sensor space for MI and ME was (24.46 +/- 5.07% vs. 28.59 +/- 5.17%) and (22.52 +/- 3.35% vs. 25.99 +/- 7.37%), respectively. Therefore, we demonstrated that EEG signals obtained from the source domain could improve the MRCP detection rather than those in the sensor domain.

A prospective study was conducted for the FDA clearance of an ACM and EDA-based CS-detection device based on a predefined machine learning algorithm. Here we present its performance on pediatric and adult patients in epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs). Methods: Patients diagnosed with epilepsy participated in a prospective multi-center clinical study. Three board-certified neurologists independently labeled CS from video-EEG. The Detection Algorithm was evaluated in terms of Sensitivity and false alarm rate per 24 h-worn (FAR) on all the data and on only periods of rest. Performance were analyzed also applying the Detection Algorithm offline, with a less sensitive but more specific parameters configuration ("Active mode"). Results: Data from 152 patients (429 days) were used for performance evaluation (85 pediatric aged 6-20 years, and 67 adult aged 21-63 years). Thirty-six patients (18 pediatric) experienced a total of 66 CS (35 pediatric). The Sensitivity (corrected for clustered data) was 0.92, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [0.85-1.00] for the pediatric population, not significantly different (p > 0.05) from the adult population's Sensitivity (0.94, CI: [0.89-1.00]). The FAR on the pediatric population was 1.26 (CI: [0.87-1.73]), higher (p < 0.001) than in the adult population (0.57, CI: [0.36-0.81]). Using the Active mode, the FAR decreased by 68% while reducing Sensitivity to 0.95 across the population. During rest periods, the FAR's were 0 for all patients, lower than during activity periods (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Performance complies with FDA's requirements of a lower bound of CI for Sensitivity higher than 0.7 and of a FAR lower than 2, for both age groups. The pediatric FAR was higher than the adult FAR, likely due to higher pediatric activity. The high Sensitivity and precision (having no false alarms) during sleep might help mitigate SUDEP risk by summoning caregiver intervention. The Active mode may be advantageous for some patients, reducing the impact of the FAR on daily life. Future work will examine the performance and usability outside of EMUs.

However, most of the ErrP studies only focus on how to distinguish the correct and wrong conditions, which is not enough for the BCI application in real scenarios. Therefore, it is necessary to study the ErrPs induced by the prediction deviants with varying degrees, concurrently test the separability of such EEG features. To this end, electroencephalogram (EEG) data of twelve healthy subjects were recorded when they participated in a direction prediction experiment. There are three prediction -deviant conditions in it, i.e., correct prediction, 90 degrees deviant, 180 degrees deviant. Event-related potential and inter-trial coherence were analyzed. Consequently, the error-related negativity (ERN) and N450 component in FCZ were significantly modulated by the degrees of prediction deviants, especially in the low-frequency band (<13Hz). Moreover, single-trial classification was adopted to test the separability of these features; the averaged accuracies between any two conditions were 87.75%, 85.25%, 64.79 degrees A. This study demonstrates the prediction deviants with varying degrees can induce separable ErrP features, which provide a deeper understanding of the ErrP signatures for developing BCIs.

In this study, field tests and analyses were conducted on physiological indexes extracted from electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) signals in miners working under the extreme conditions of a plateau environment. To provide insights into models for fatigue classification and recognition based on machine learning, multi-modal feature information fusion and miner fatigue identification based on ECG and EMG signals as physiological indicators were studied. Methods: Fifty-five miners were randomly selected as field test subjects, and characteristic signals were extracted from 110 groups of ECG and EMG signals as the basic signals for fatigue analysis. We conducted principal component analysis (PCA) and grey relational analysis (GRA) on the measurement indicators. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XG-Boost) machine learning models were used for fatigue classification based on multi-modal information fusion. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the confusion matrix were used to evaluate the performance of the recognition models. Results: The ECG and EMG signals showed obvious changes with fatigue. The results of fatigue model identification showed that PCA feature fusion was superior to GRA feature fusion for all three machine learning approaches, and XG-Boost achieved the best performance, with a recognition accuracy of 89.47%, a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, and an AUC of 0.90. The SVM model also showed good recognition performance (89.47% accuracy, AUC = 0.89). The worst performance was that of the RF model, with a recognition accuracy of only 78.95%. Conclusions: This study shows that the physiological indexes of ECG and EMG exhibit obvious, regular changes with fatigue and that it is feasible to use SVM, RF and XG-Boost models for miner fatigue identification. The PCA fusion technique can improve the identification accuracy more than the GRA method. XG-Boost classification yields the best accuracy and robustness. This study can serve as a reference for clinical research on the identification of human fatigue at high altitudes and for the clinical study of acute mountain sickness and human acclimatization to high altitudes.

According to a survey, the number of patients with dementia in Japan would exceed 10 million by 2060. Thus, there is a need to develop simple techniques for early diagnosis of dementia to suppress the increase in patients with dementia. In our laboratory, we are developing a dementia-screening tool using character input-type Brain-Computer Interface. In this study the electroencephalogram (EEG) data obtained using the tool were analyzed in the frequency band. The purpose is to find the difference in EEG between healthy people, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The results show that the mean value of the ratio of beta to alpha wave (beta/alpha) significantly differs between healthy subjects and MCI patients. The mean value of beta/alpha was lower in the MCI patients than in the healthy subjects. In addition, there was also a significant difference in the range of beta/alpha between beta/alpha for patients with MCI and that for the patients with AD; that of AD patients was higher. From the results, it is considered that the degree of concentration decreases, and its variation becomes remarkable as the cognitive function declines. With these indicators, the three states are expected to be classified. In future studies, we shall verify whether the classification accuracy can be improved by using these indicators in machine learning.

Predictive Feedback, Early Sensory Representations, and Fast Responses to Predicted Stimuli Depend on NMDA Receptors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						NMDARs; predictive coding	FUSIFORM FACE AREA; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GRANGER CAUSALITY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; KETAMINE; MODEL; FEEDFORWARD; POWER	Learned associations between stimuli allow us to model the world and make predictions, crucial for efficient behavior (e.g., hearing a siren, we expect to see an ambulance and quickly make way). While there are theoretical and computational frameworks for prediction, the circuit and receptor-level mechanisms are unclear. Using high-density EEG, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning, we show that inferred "causal" relationships between stimuli and frontal alpha activity account for reaction times (a proxy for predictions) on a trial-by-trial basis in an audiovisual delayed match-to-sample task which elicited predictions. Predictive beta feedback activated sensory representations in advance of predicted stimuli. Low-dose ketamine, an NMDAR blocker, but not the control drug dexmedetomidine, perturbed behavioral indices of predictions, their representation in higher-order cortex, feedback to posterior cortex, and pre-activation of sensory templates in higher-order sensory cortex. This study suggests that predictions depend on alpha activity in higher-order cortex, beta feedback, and NMDARs, and ketamine blocks access to learned predictive information.

More research is needed to understand the latter coordination's complexity in designing better and more effective rehabilitation strategies for gait disorders. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are among the most used technologies for monitoring brain activities due to portability, non-invasiveness, and relatively low cost compared to others. Fusing EEG and fNIRS is a well-known and established methodology proven to enhance brain-computer interface (BCI) performance in terms of classification accuracy, number of control commands, and response time. Although there has been significant research exploring hybrid BCI (hBCI) involving both EEG and fNIRS for different types of tasks and human activities, human gait remains still underinvestigated. In this article, we aim to shed light on the recent development in the analysis of human gait using a hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI system. The current review has followed guidelines of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) during the data collection and selection phase. In this review, we put a particular focus on the commonly used signal processing and machine learning algorithms, as well as survey the potential applications of gait analysis. We distill some of the critical findings of this survey as follows. First, hardware specifications and experimental paradigms should be carefully considered because of their direct impact on the quality of gait assessment. Second, since both modalities, EEG and fNIRS, are sensitive to motion artifacts, instrumental, and physiological noises, there is a quest for more robust and sophisticated signal processing algorithms. Third, hybrid temporal and spatial features, obtained by virtue of fusing EEG and fNIRS and associated with cortical activation, can help better identify the correlation between brain activation and gait. In conclusion, hBCI (EEG + fNIRS) system is not yet much explored for the lower limb due to its complexity compared to the higher limb. Existing BCI systems for gait monitoring tend to only focus on one modality. We foresee a vast potential in adopting hBCI in gait analysis. Imminent technical breakthroughs are expected using hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI for gait to control assistive devices and Monitor neuro-plasticity in neuro-rehabilitation. However, although those hybrid systems perform well in a controlled experimental environment when it comes to adopting them as a certified medical device in real-life clinical applications, there is still a long way to go.

The aesthetic evaluation of music is strongly dependent on the listener and reflects manifold brain processes that go well beyond the perception of incident sound. Being a high-level cognitive reaction, it is difficult to predict merely from the acoustic features of the audio signal and this poses serious challenges to contemporary music recommendation systems. We attempted to decode music appraisal from brain activity, recorded via wearable EEG, during music listening. Approach. To comply with the dynamic nature of music stimuli, cross-frequency coupling measurements were employed in a time-evolving manner to capture the evolving interactions between distinct brain-rhythms during music listening. Brain response to music was first represented as a continuous flow of functional couplings referring to both regional and inter-regional brain dynamics and then modelled as an ensemble of time-varying (sub)networks. Dynamic graph centrality measures were derived, next, as the final feature-engineering step and, lastly, a support-vector machine was trained to decode the subjective music appraisal. A carefully designed experimental paradigm provided the labeled brain signals. Main results. Using data from 20 subjects, dynamic programming to tailor the decoder to each subject individually and cross-validation, we demonstrated highly satisfactory performance (MAE = 0.948, R-2 = 0.63) that can be attributed, mostly, to interactions of left frontal gamma rhythm. In addition, our music-appraisal decoder was also employed in a part of the DEAP dataset with similar success. Finally, even a generic version of the decoder (common for all subjects) was found to perform sufficiently. Significance. A novel brain signal decoding scheme was introduced and validated empirically on suitable experimental data. It requires simple operations and leaves room for real-time implementation.

J	Liu, Q; Zheng, WH; Chen, K; Ma, L; Ai, QS				Liu, Quan; Zheng, Wenhao; Chen, Kun; Ma, Li; Ai, Qingsong			Online detection of class-imbalanced error-related potentials evoked by motor imagery	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; error-related potentials; online detection; adaptive autoregressive; common spatial pattern; adaptive threshold; spectral regression discriminant analysis	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EEG; PERFORMANCE	Objective. Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are spontaneous electroencephalogram signals related to the awareness of erroneous responses within brain domain. ErrPs-based correction mechanisms can be applied to motor imagery-brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) to prevent incorrect actions and ultimately improve the performance of the hybrid BCI. Many studies on ErrPs detection are mostly conducted under offline conditions with poor classification accuracy and the error rates of ErrPs are preset in advance, which is too ideal to apply in realistic applications. In order to solve these problems, a novel method based on adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model and common spatial pattern (CSP) is proposed for ErrPs feature extraction. In addition, an adaptive threshold classification method based spectral regression discriminant analysis (SRDA) is suggested for class-unbalanced ErrPs data to reduce the false positives and false negatives. Approach. As for ErrPs feature extraction, the AAR coefficients in the temporal domain and CSP in the spatial domain are fused. Given that the performance of different subjects' MI tasks is different but stable, and the samples of ErrPs are class-imbalanced, an adaptive threshold based SRDA is suggested for classification. Two datasets are used in this paper. The open public clinical neuroprosthetics and brain interaction (CNBI) dataset is used to validate the performance of the proposed feature extraction algorithm and the real-time data recorded in our self-designed system is used to validate the performance of the proposed classification algorithm under class-imbalanced situations. Different from the pseudo-random paradigm, the ErrPs signals collected in our experiments are all elicited by four-class of online MI-BCI tasks, and the sample distribution is more natural and suitable for practical tests. Main results. The experimental results on the CNBI dataset show that the average accuracy and false positive rate for ErrPs detection are 94.1% and 8.1%, which outperforms methods using features extracted from a single domain. What's more, although the ErrPs induction rate is affected by the performance of subjects' MI-BCI tasks, experimental results on data recorded in the self-designed system prove that the ErrPs classification algorithm based on an adaptive threshold is robust under different ErrPs data distributions. Compared with two other methods, the proposed algorithm has advantages in all three measures which are accuracy, F1-score and false positive rate. Finally, ErrPs detection results were used to prevent wrong actions in a MI-BCI experiment, and it leads to a reduction of the hybrid BCI error rate from 48.9% to 24.3% in online tests. Significance. Both the AAR-CSP fused feature extraction and the adaptive threshold based SRDA classification methods suggested in our work are efficient in improving the ErrPs detection accuracy and reducing the false positives. In addition, by introducing ErrPs to multi-class MI-BCIs, the MI decoding results can be corrected after ErrPs are detected to avoid executing wrong instructions, thereby improving the BCI accuracy and lays the foundation for using MI-BCIs in practical applications.

Human participants of both sexes were either familiarized perceptually, via media exposure, or by personal interaction. We observed significant cross-experiment familiarity decoding involving all three experiments, predominantly over posterior and central regions of the right hemisphere in the 270-630 ms time window. This shared face familiarity effect was most prominent across the Media and the Personal, as well as between the Perceptual and Personal experiments. Cross-experiment decodability makes this signal a strong candidate for a general neural indicator of face familiarity, independent of familiarization methods, participants, and stimuli. Furthermore, the sustained pattern of temporal generalization suggests that it reflects a single automatic processing cascade that is maintained over time.

Nonetheless, in spite of a large number of success stories in relevant application areas, and even in industrial contexts, deductive reasoning cannot be considered the ultimate, comprehensive solution to artificial intelligence; indeed, in several contexts, other approaches result to be more useful. Typical bioinformatics tasks, for instance classification, are currently carried out mostly by machine learning (ML)-based solutions. In this paper, we focus on the relatively new problem of analyzing the evolution of neurological disorders. In this context, ML approaches already demonstrated to be a viable solution for classification tasks; here, we show how ASP can play a relevant role in the brain evolution simulation task. In particular, we propose a general and extensible framework to support physicians and researchers at understanding the complex mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. The framework relies on a combined use of ML and ASP, and is general enough to be applied in several other application scenarios, which are outlined in the paper.

The conventionally used BIS Quantro machine which measures the Bispectral Index (BIS) level in order to help doctors administer anesthesia, is quite expensive. In this paper, an economic, accurate and state-of-the-art technique is presented to predict the depth of anesthesia (DoA) via advanced deep learning models using 512 Hz Electrocardiogram (ECG) and 128 Hz Photoplethysmography (PPG). The study is conducted based on signal collected from 50 patients acquired during surgery at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). First, heatmaps of the ECG and PPG signals (individual and combined subplots) are generated using MATLAB by filtering 5 s windows to match the frequency of the BIS Quantro Machine which is 0.2 Hz. Then, various deep learning models comprising 5, 6, 8, 10 and 19 layered CNNs are trained using data of 40 patients and tested using the remaining 10 patients. The heatmap images of ECG and PPG are fed as inputs to the CNN models separately and using two input channels. The best accuracy achieved is 86 % which is attained using 10 layered CNN with Tensorflow backend, with combined ECG and PPG heatmaps as inputs. This study uses inexpensive signals, minimum data reconstruction, minimum memory and timing constrains to achieve a decent accuracy, and so it can be used by even small hospitals.

The boundary samples are recognized by calculating the boundary factors of each sample, based on which the sample space is divided into boundary and non-boundary domain. The negative samples in the non-boundary domain are undersampling. Owing to the sparsity of the samples in the boundary domain, the positive samples are oversampling by leveraging the composite minority oversampling technique using the maximum distance. This is used to retain the information of the positive samples to the maximum extent Taking recall, F1 value, g-mean and AUC values. Next, the evaluation indexes learn the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm in order to verify its effectiveness on five data sets with different balance degrees. Therefore, our method can effectively deal with unbalanced data. The algorithm first introduces the concept of support k-outlier degree to identify the boundary point set and non-boundary point set in the data set. It then leverages the improved smote algorithm to synthesize the new point set by taking the boundary points in a few classes as the target samples. It further calculates the distance by the sampling algorithm for the non-boundary points toward most classes in order to achieve the balance between classes. Compared with other four methods. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm has good performance on different data sets, with an average increase of 3.5%. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an event-related potential component representing pre-attentive auditory processing, which is closely associated with cognitive status. We investigated MMN features as biomarkers to classify drug-naive adult patients with ADHD and healthy controls (HCs). Sensor-level features (amplitude and latency) and source-level features (source activation) of MMN were investigated and compared between the electroencephalograms of 34 patients with ADHD and 45 HCs using a passive auditory oddball paradigm. Correlations between MMN features and ADHD symptoms were analyzed. Finally, we applied machine learning to differentiate the two groups using sensor- and source-level features of MMN. Adult patients with ADHD showed significantly lower MMN amplitudes at the frontocentral electrodes and reduced MMN source activation in the frontal, temporal, and limbic lobes, which were closely associated with MMN generators and ADHD pathophysiology. Source activities were significantly correlated with ADHD symptoms. The best classification performance for adult ADHD patients and HCs showed an 81.01% accuracy, 82.35% sensitivity, and 80.00% specificity based on MMN source activity features. Our results suggest that abnormal MMN reflects the adult ADHD patients' pathophysiological characteristics and might serve clinically as a neuromarker of adult ADHD.

Motor imagery (MI) EEG signals vary greatly among subjects, so scholarly research on motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has mainly focused on single-subject systems or subject-dependent systems. However, the single-subject model is applicable only to the target subject, and the small sample number greatly limits the performance of the model. This paper aims to study a convolutional neural network to achieve an adaptable MI-BCI that is applicable to multiple subjects. Approach. In this paper, a twin cascaded softmax convolutional neural network (TCSCNN) is proposed for multisubject MI-BCIs. The proposed TCSCNN is independent and can be applied to any single-subject MI classification convolutional neural network (CNN) model. First, to reduce the influence of individual differences, subject recognition and MI recognition are accomplished simultaneously. A cascaded softmax structure consisting of two softmax layers, related to subject recognition and MI recognition, is subsequently applied. Second, to improve the MI classification precision, a twin network structure is proposed on the basis of ensemble learning. TCSCNN is built by combining a cascaded softmax structure and twin network structure. Main results. Experiments were conducted on three popular CNN models (EEGNet and Shallow ConvNet and Deep ConvNet from EEGDecoding) and three public datasets (BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b and the high-gamma dataset) to verify the performance of the proposed TCSCNN. The results show that compared with the state-of-the-art CNN model, the proposed TCSCNN obviously improves the precision and convergence of multisubject MI recognition. Significance. This study provides a promising scheme for multisubject MI-BCI, reflecting the progress made in the development and application of MI-BCIs.

How we successful encode and recover these features in time, whether these temporal dynamics are preserved across age, even under conditions of reduced memory performance, and the role of attention on these temporal dynamics is unknown. In the current study, we applied time-resolved multivariate decoding to oscillatory electroencephalography (EEG) in an adult lifespan sample to investigate the temporal order of successful encoding and recognition of simple and complex perceptual context features. At encoding, participants studied pictures of black and white objects presented with both color (low-level/simple) and scene (high-level/complex) context features and subsequently made context memory decisions for both features. Attentional demands were manipulated by having participants attend to the relationship between the object and either the color or scene while ignoring the other context feature. Consistent with hierarchical visual perception models, simple visual features (color) were successfully encoded earlier than were complex features (scenes). These features were successfully recognized in the reverse temporal order. Importantly, these temporal dynamics were both dependent on whether these context features were in the focus of one's attention, and preserved across age, despite age-related context memory impairments. These novel results support the idea that episodic memories are encoded and retrieved successively, likely dependent on the input and output pathways of the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and attentional influences that bias activity within these pathways across age.

However, several traditional BCI recognition algorithms have the "one person, one model" issue, where the convergence of the recognition model's training process is complicated. In this study, a new BCI model with a Dense long short-term memory (Dense-LSTM) algorithm is proposed, which combines the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the event-related synchronization (ERS) of the imagery-based BCI; model training and testing were conducted with its own data set. Furthermore, a new experimental platform was built to decode the neural activity of different subjects in a static state. Experimental evaluation of the proposed recognition algorithm presents an accuracy of 91.56%, which resolves the "one person one model" issue along with the difficulty of convergence in the training process.

Differential mechanisms of posterior cingulate cortex downregulation and symptom decreases in posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy individuals using real-time fMRI neurofeedback	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						machine learning; neurofeedback; post-traumatic stress disorder; real-time fMRI	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DEFAULT NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; ALARM SYSTEM; BRAIN; PTSD; METAANALYSIS; RESPONSES; NEUROBIOLOGY; VETERANS	Background Intrinsic connectivity networks, including the default mode network (DMN), are frequently disrupted in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is the main hub of the posterior DMN, where the therapeutic regulation of this region with real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NFB) has yet to be explored. Methods We investigated PCC downregulation while processing trauma/stressful words over 3 NFB training runs and a transfer run without NFB (total n = 29, PTSD n = 14, healthy controls n = 15). We also examined the predictive accuracy of machine learning models in classifying PTSD versus healthy controls during NFB training. Results Both the PTSD and healthy control groups demonstrated reduced reliving symptoms in response to trauma/stressful stimuli, where the PTSD group additionally showed reduced symptoms of distress. We found that both groups were able to downregulate the PCC with similar success over NFB training and in the transfer run, although downregulation was associated with unique within-group decreases in activation within the bilateral dmPFC, bilateral postcentral gyrus, right amygdala/hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and bilateral temporal pole/gyri. By contrast, downregulation was associated with increased activation in the right dlPFC among healthy controls as compared to PTSD. During PCC downregulation, right dlPFC activation was negatively correlated to PTSD symptom severity scores and difficulties in emotion regulation. Finally, machine learning algorithms were able to classify PTSD versus healthy participants based on brain activation during NFB training with 80% accuracy. Conclusions This is the first study to investigate PCC downregulation with real-time fMRI NFB in both PTSD and healthy controls. Our results reveal acute decreases in symptoms over training and provide converging evidence for EEG-NFB targeting brain networks linked to the PCC.

In a small group of patients, the condition may evolve to encephalopathic syndromes including epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ECSWS), or Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS). Development of prediction models for early identification of at-risk children is of utmost importance. Aim: To develop a predictive model of encephalopathic transformation using data-driven approaches, reveal complex interactions to identify potential risk factors. Methods: Data were collected from a cohort of 91 patients diagnosed with BECTS treated between the years 2005-2017 at a pediatric neurology institute. Data on the initial presentation was collected based on a novel BECTS ontology and used to discover potential risk factors and to build a predictive model. Statistical and machine learning methods were compared. Results: A subgroup of 18 children had encephalopathic transformation. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression Model with Elastic Net was able to successfully detect children with ECSWS or LKS. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.83 and 0.44. The most notable risk factors were fronto-temporal and temporo-parietal localization of epileptic foci, semiology of seizure involving dysarthria or somatosensory auras. Conclusion: Novel prediction model for early identification of patients with BECTS at risk for ECSWS or LKS. This model can be used as a screening tool and assist physicians to consider special management for children predicted at high-risk. Clinical application of machine learning methods opens new frontiers of personalized patient care and treatment. (C) 2020 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Those types of BCI can be operated with little to no training, achieve high classification accuracies and are robust in application. A drawback of this approach is the reduced user comfort due to the constant flickering of the stimuli which can be annoying and tiring to look at. Existing studies addressing this issue try to make use of motion to disguise the oscillating patterns. However, this makes them look abstract and restricts the design of those applications as those patterns do not blend in to conventional user interfaces. In this work we introduce the concept of spinning icons to evoke SSVEPs. The icons are rotating in a certain frequency around their vertical axis and are supposed to appear more natural and be less stressing for the human eye. Furthermore this concept is not bound to any kind of abstract motion based pattern but rather supposed to work with any type of icon or image. The newly designed stimuli were evaluated in an application-oriented scenario and compared to standard and state-of-the-art movement-based SSVEP stimuli regarding the classification accuracy and experienced visual fatigue. The results show that the newly created stimuli performed equally well and partially even better in terms of classification accuracy and were rated throughout better concerning visual fatigue by the study participants. This work therefore lays the foundation for more comfortable SSVEP-BCIs which can be used with basically every icon or UI element spinning around their vertical axis.

The irregularity of NDD vGRF signals caused by gait abnormalities can indicate different force pattern variations compared to a healthy control (HC). The main purpose of this research is to help physicians in the early detection of NDDs, efficient treatment planning, and monitoring of disease progression. The detection algorithm comprises a preprocessing process, a feature transformation process, and a classification process. In the preprocessing process, the five-minute vertical ground reaction force signal was divided into 10, 30, and 60 s successive time windows. In the feature transformation process, the time-domain vGRF signal was modified into a time-frequency spectrogram using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, feature enhancement with principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized. Finally, a convolutional neural network, as a deep learning classifier, was employed in the classification process of the proposed detection algorithm and evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and k-fold cross-validation (k-fold CV, k = 5). The proposed detection algorithm can effectively differentiate gait patterns based on a time-frequency spectrogram of a vGRF signal between HC subjects and patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

In MI-BCI, a classification model is built to identify the target limb from MI-based EEG signals, but the performance of models cannot meet the demand for practical use. Lightweight neural networks in deep learning methods are used to build high performance models in MI-BCI. Small sample sizes and the lack of multi-scale information extraction in frequency domain limit the performance improvement of lightweight neural networks. To solve these problems, the Filter Bank Sinc-ShallowNet (FB-Sinc-ShallowNet) algorithm combined with the mixed noise adding method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was proposed. The FB-Sinc-ShallowNet algorithm improves a lightweight neural network Sinc-ShallowNet with a filter bank structure corresponding to four sensory motor rhythms. The mixed noise adding method employs the EMD method to improve the quality of generated data. The proposed method was evaluated on the BCI competition IV IIa dataset and can achieve highest average accuracy of 77.2%, about 634% higher than state-of-the-art method Sinc-ShallowNet. This work implies the effectiveness of filter bank structure in lightweight neural networks and provides a novel option for data augmentation and classification of MI-based EEG signals, which can be applied in the rehabilitation field for decoding MI-EEG with few samples.

The electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been used in the control of robotic arms. The performance of non-invasive BCIs may not be satisfactory due to the poor quality of EEG signals, so the shared control strategies were tried as an alternative solution. However, most of the existing shared control methods set the arbitration rules manually, which highly depended on the specific tasks and developer's experience. In this study, we proposed a novel shared control model that automatically optimized the control commands in a dynamical way based on the context in real-time control. Besides, we employed the hybrid BCI to better allocate commands with multiple functions. The system allowed non-invasive BCI users to manipulate a robotic arm moving in a three-dimensional (3D) space and complete a pick-place task of multiple objects. Approach. Taking the scene information obtained by computer vision as a knowledge base, a machine agent was designed to infer the user's intention and generate automatic commands. Based on the inference confidence and user's characteristic, the proposed shared control model fused the machine autonomy and human intention dynamically for robotic arm motion optimization during the online control. In addition, we introduced a hybrid BCI scheme that applied steady-state visual evoked potentials and motor imagery to the divided primary and secondary BCI interfaces to better allocate the BCI resources (e.g. decoding computing power, screen occupation) and realize the multi-dimensional control of the robotic arm. Main results. Eleven subjects participated in the online experiments of picking and placing five objects that scattered at different positions in a 3D workspace. The results showed that most of the subjects could control the robotic arm to complete accurate and robust picking task with an average success rate of approximately 85% under the shared control strategy, while the average success rate of placing task controlled by pure BCI was 50% approximately. Significance. In this paper, we proposed a novel shared controller for motion automatic optimization, together with a hybrid BCI control scheme that allocated paradigms according to the importance of commands to realize multi-dimensional and effective control of a robotic arm. Our study indicated that the shared control strategy with hybrid BCI could greatly improve the performance of the brain-actuated robotic arm system.

However, this has been tested mainly in well-controlled environments and based on temporal features, such as the amplitude of event-related potentials. In this study, we propose a classification algorithm combining frequency features and a weighted SVM to detect the neuronal signatures of errors committed in a complex saccadic go/no-go task. We follow the hypothesis that frequency features yield better discrimination performance in complex tasks, generalize better, and require fewer pre-processing steps. When combining temporal and frequency features, we achieved a balanced classification accuracy of 75% - almost the same as using only frequency features. On the other hand, when using only temporal features, the balanced accuracy decreased to 66% These findings show that subjects' performance can be automatically detected based on frequency features of error-related neuronal signatures. Additionally, our results revealed that features computed in the pre-response time contribute to the discrimination between correct and erroneous responses, which suggests the existence of error-related patterns even before response execution.

VP and VI are defined as a changing of brain signals when perceiving and memorizing visual information, respectively. These paradigms could be alternatives to the previous visual-based paradigms which have limitations such as fatigue and low information transfer rates. In this study, we analyzed VP and VI to investigate the possibility to control BCI. First, we conducted a time-frequency analysis with event-related spectral perturbation. In addition, two types of decoding accuracies were obtained with convolutional neural network to verify whether the brain signals can be distinguished from each class in the VP and whether they can be differentiated with VP and VI paradigms. As a result, the 6-class classification performance in VP was 32.56% (+/- 7.07) and the binary classification performance which classifies two paradigms was 90.16% (+/- 9.69).

Nevertheless there exists significant evidence on feature ranking and selection algorithms based on any criterion leading to potentially sub-optimal solutions for class separability. In that regard, we introduce emerging information theoretic feature transformation protocols as an end-to end neural network training approach. We present a dimensionality reduction network (MMINet) training procedure based on the stochastic estimate of the mutual information gradient. The network projects high-dimensional features onto an output feature space where lower dimensional representations of features carry maximum mutual information with their associated class labels. Furthermore, we formulate the training objective to be estimated non-parametrically with no distributional assumptions. We experimentally evaluate our method with applications to high-dimensional biological data sets, and relate it to conventional feature selection algorithms to form a special case of our approach.

This study uses multiple convolutional neural networks to decode the electroencephalogram (EEG) of stroke patients to design effective motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This study has introduced 'fine-tune' to transfer model parameters and reduced training time. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated by the abilities of the models for two-class MI recognition. The results show that the best framework is the combination of the EEGNet and 'fine-tune' transferred model. The average classification accuracy of the proposed model for 11 subjects is 66.36%, and the algorithm complexity is much lower than other models.These good performance indicate that the EEGNet model has great potential for MI stroke rehabilitation based on BCI system. It also successfully demonstrated the efficiency of transfer learning for improving the performance of EEG-based stroke rehabilitation for the BCI system.

Methods Data of three groups of adult people with epilepsy (PwE) were analyzed. Group 1 underwent VEEG with additional devices (accelerometry, ECG, electrodermal activity); group 2 underwent VEEG; and group 3 underwent mobile EEG recordings both including one-lead ECG. All seizure types were analyzed. Feature extraction and machine-learning techniques were applied to develop seizure detection algorithms. Performance was expressed as sensitivity, precision, F-1 score, and false positives per 24 hours. Results The algorithms were developed in group 1 (35 PwE, 33 seizures) and achieved best results (F-1 score 56%, sensitivity 67%, precision 45%, false positives 0.7/24 hours) when ECG features alone were used, with no improvement by including accelerometry and electrodermal activity. In group 2 (97 PwE, 255 seizures), this ECG-based algorithm largely achieved the same performance (F-1 score 51%, sensitivity 39%, precision 73%, false positives 0.4/24 hours). In group 3 (30 PwE, 51 seizures), the same ECG-based algorithm failed to meet up with the performance in groups 1 and 2 (F-1 score 27%, sensitivity 31%, precision 23%, false positives 1.2/24 hours). ECG-based algorithms were also separately trained on data of groups 2 and 3 and tested on the data of the other groups, yielding maximal F-1 scores between 8% and 26%. Significance Our results suggest that algorithms based on ECG features alone can provide clinically meaningful performance for automatic detection of all seizure types. Our study also underscores that the circumstances under which such algorithms were developed, and the selection of the training and test data sets need to be considered and limit the application of such systems to unseen patient groups behaving in different conditions.

Brain-Computer Interfaces have shown promise as an alternative communication modality by directly transforming neural activity of speech processes into a textual or audible representations. Previous studies investigating such speech neuroprostheses relied on electrocorticography (ECoG) or microelectrode arrays that acquire neural signals from superficial areas on the cortex. While both measurement methods have demonstrated successful speech decoding, they do not capture activity from deeper brain structures and this activity has therefore not been harnessed for speech-related BCIs. In this study, we bridge this gap by adapting a previously presented decoding pipeline for speech synthesis based on ECoG signals to implanted depth electrodes (sEEG). For this purpose, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network that extracts speech-related activity separately for each electrode shaft and estimates spectral coefficients to reconstruct an audible waveform. We evaluate our approach on open-loop data from 5 patients who conducted a recitation task of Dutch utterances. We achieve correlations of up to 0.80 between original and reconstructed speech spectrograms, which are significantly above chance level for all patients (p < 0.001). Our results indicate that sEEG can yield similar speech decoding performance to prior ECoG studies and is a promising modality for speech BCIs.

Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI stands out among many BCI paradigms because of its non-invasiveness, little user training, and high information transfer rate (ITR). However, the use of conductive gel and bulky hardware in the traditional Electroencephalogram (EEG) method hinder the application of SSVEP-based BCIs. Besides, continuous visual stimulation in long time use will lead to visual fatigue and pose a new challenge to the practical application. This study provides an open dataset, which is collected based on a wearable SSVEP-based BCI system, and comprehensively compares the SSVEP data obtained by wet and dry electrodes. The dataset consists of 8-channel EEG data from 102 healthy subjects performing a 12-target SSVEP-based BCI task. For each subject, 10 consecutive blocks were recorded using wet and dry electrodes, respectively. The dataset can be used to investigate the performance of wet and dry electrodes in SSVEP-based BCIs. Besides, the dataset provides sufficient data for developing new target identification algorithms to improve the performance of wearable SSVEP-based BCIs.

The incorporation of multiple bio-signals in commercial electric wheelchair control systems would increase functionality of the assistive devices for people with restricted or erratic hand movement, consequently increasing the quality of life of such users. This study reports on the implementation of a multimodal bio-signal control system for an electric wheelchair. In this design, wheelchair control via the standard joystick was replaced by a wireless EEG headset with four direction modes - forward, turn (left), turn (right), and neutraUno movement. Control of the movement of the chair is obtained through the analysis of EEG signals, EOG signals and some EMG signals, measured simultaneously. Data is gathered from a minimum number of electrodes, six in total, residing on the low cost commercial Emotiv EPOC+ EEG Headset. Bio-signals are sent from the EPOC+ to the USB dongle in a computer, which filters and processes the data using Python scripts. A moving average gradient thresholding Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules paradigm has been implemented to ascertain the intended movement direction of the user. The movement intention class is sent via Wi-Fi to a Raspberry Pi with custom PCB which is wired into the joystick plug. The multi-modal bio-signal system proves highly effective, obtaining a classification accuracy of 97.7% over three different trials, though seven instances of false positives were observed, prompting future optimisation of the classification system.

The main characteristic of this disease is a frequent seizure, which is an electrical imbalance in the brain. It is generally accompanied by shaking of body parts and even leads (fainting). In the past few years, many treatments have come up. These mainly involve the use of anti-seizure drugs for controlling seizures. But in 70% of cases, these drugs are not effective, and surgery is the only solution when the condition worsens. So patients need to take care of themselves while having a seizure and be safe. Wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices have come up with the development in medical science and technology. These devices help in the analysis of brain electrical activities. EEG helps in locating the affected cortical region. The most important is that it can predict any seizure in advance on-site. This has resulted in a sudden increase in demand for effective and efficient seizure prediction and diagnosis systems. A novel approach to epileptic seizure prediction and diagnosis system "EpilNet" is proposed in the present paper. It is a one-dimensional (1D) convolution neural network. EpilNet gives the testing accuracy of 79.13% for five classes, leading to a significant increase of about 6-7% compared to related works. The developed Web API helps in bringing EpilNet into practical use. Thus, it is an integrated system for both patients and doctors. The system will help patients prevent injury or accidents and increase the efficiency of the treatment process by doctors in the hospitals.

However, the inefficiency problem that a typical BCI system is unable to effectively decode EEG signals in some users, prevents BCI technology from benefitting all users. The proportion of inefficiency varies in the major BCI paradigms, among which Motor Imagery (MI)-based BCI achieves highest (10%-50%). Hence, the question arises as to whether other BCI paradigms, such as P300, could be substitutes for users who cannot be served by certain paradigm. In this work, a cross-paradigms BCI experiment, in which 93 healthy subjects executed BCI tasks including real movement and P300 for two sessions on separated days, was performed to answer the above question. Firstly, the highly correlation between the recognition accuracy in two sessions within subjects for both Sensory Motor Rhythm (SMR) features ( p = 4.47x10(-11)) and P300 features ( p = 2.17x10(-3)) indicated the reproducibility of the subject-level BCI inefficiency in the two paradigms. Further analysis demonstrated no significant correlation between the decoding performance of the SMR and P300 features ( p = 0.604). The results verified the feasibility of improving BCI decoding performance by replacing certain BCI paradigm with another one when users encounter the problem of BCI inefficiency.

In this paper, we revisited the popular assumption of fixed workload levels determined by the driving environment, and propose a framework to generate a Personalized Driver Workload Profile (PDWP) that incorporates individual differences. A rich set of physiological and operational data from a real-traffic Electric Vehicle (EV) driving experiment was utilized. Physiological features were generated and selected from forty drivers' electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using multiple signal processing and machine learning techniques. A PDWP is defined as a random variable with three possible workload levels, and conditional distributions of the PDWP of the rest period and four driving environments were generated using fuzzy c-means clustering. The results revealed there exists little resemblance among the PDWPs of individual drivers, even in an identical driving environment. Moreover, some drivers exhibited strong evidence of EV range stress, but such phenomena were not universal. Our study is the first attempt to incorporate individual differences in estimating driving workload based on the direct cognitive responses using physiological data collected in a real-traffic experiment.

Subject-independent decoding of affective states using functional near-infrared spectroscopy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CORTEX ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; MOTOR IMAGERY; BOLD SIGNAL; HUMAN-BRAIN; NEUROFEEDBACK; FMRI; EMOTION; NIRS; EEG	Affective decoding is the inference of human emotional states using brain signal measurements. This approach is crucial to develop new therapeutic approaches for psychiatric rehabilitation, such as affective neurofeedback protocols. To reduce the training duration and optimize the clinical outputs, an ideal clinical neurofeedback could be trained using data from an independent group of volunteers before being used by new patients. Here, we investigated if this subject-independent design of affective decoding can be achieved using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals from frontal and occipital areas. For this purpose, a linear discriminant analysis classifier was first trained in a dataset (49 participants, 24.65 +/- 3.23 years) and then tested in a completely independent one (20 participants, 24.00 +/- 3.92 years). Significant balanced accuracies between classes were found for positive vs. negative (64.50 +/- 12.03%, p<0.01) and negative vs. neutral (68.25 +/- 12.97%, p<0.01) affective states discrimination during a reactive block consisting in viewing affective-loaded images. For an active block, in which volunteers were instructed to recollect personal affective experiences, significant accuracy was found for positive vs. neutral affect classification (71.25 +/- 18.02%, p<0.01). In this last case, only three fNIRS channels were enough to discriminate between neutral and positive affective states. Although more research is needed, for example focusing on better combinations of features and classifiers, our results highlight fNIRS as a possible technique for subject-independent affective decoding, reaching significant classification accuracies of emotional states using only a few but biologically relevant features.

AD causes significant disability due to the devastating impact on the patients' day-to-day living activities and their loss of independence. One such day-to-day activity is driving, a complex task that requires attention, concentration, the ability to follow particular steps, react to stimuli promptly, and the ability to perceive and interpret visual-spatial information, all of which can be impaired in AD. Therefore, to ensure the safety of AD patients and other drivers, it is important to develop accurate and low-cost diagnostic tools to assess patients' fitness-to-drive. In this study, we develop machine learning (ML) models to predict fitness-to-drive using the electroencephalogram (EEG) technique of event-related potential (ERP). Specifically, we develop random forest (RF) models using EEG signals in early-stage AD patients and age-matched controls and conduct numerical experiments to predict fitness-to-drive and other driving performance metrics, collected from driving simulator data. Our results show that RF models predict patients' fitness-to-drive with AUC=0.83 and provide accurate measures of other driving performance metrics.

This review included 172 articles, from which 234 experiments were extracted. For each of them, we reported the used data set, the feature types, the algorithm type, performance and potential methodological issues. The impact of these characteristics on the performance was evaluated using a multivariate mixed effect linear regressions. We found that using cognitive, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography or potentially electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography variables significantly improved predictive performance compared to not including them, whereas including other modalities, in particular T1 magnetic resonance imaging, did not show a significant effect. The good performance of cognitive assessments questions the wide use of imaging for predicting the progression to AD and advocates for exploring further fine domain-specific cognitive assessments. We also identified several methodological issues, including the absence of a test set, or its use for feature selection or parameter tuning in nearly a fourth of the papers. Other issues, found in 15% of the studies, cast doubts on the relevance of the method to clinical practice. We also highlight that short-term predictions are likely not to be better than predicting that subjects stay stable over time. These issues highlight the importance of adhering to good practices for the use of machine learning as a decision support system for the clinical practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of the present study was to establish whether eccentricity representation in WM could be decoded from eletroencephalography (EEG) alpha-band oscillation in parietal cortex during delay-period while performing memory-guided saccade (MGS) task. In this regard, we recorded EEG and Eye-tracking signals of 17 healthy volunteers in a variant version of MGS task. We designed the modified version of MGS task for the first time to investigate the effect of locating stimuli in two different positions, in a near (6 degrees) eccentricity and far (12 degrees) eccentricity on saccade error as a behavioral parameter. Another goal of study was to discern whether or not varying the stimuli loci can alter behavioral and eletroencephalographical data while performing the variant version of MGS task. Our findings demonstrate that saccade error for the near fixation condition is significantly smaller than the far from fixation condition. We observed an increase in alpha power in parietal lobe in near vs far conditions. In addition, the results indicate that the increase in alpha (8-12 Hz) power from fixation to memory was negatively correlated with saccade error. The novel approach of using simultaneous EEG/Eye-tracking recording in the modified MGS task provided both behavioral and electroencephalographic analyses for oscillatory activity during this new version of MGS task.

However, to be applicable in these contexts, the machine learning methods must provide a degree of insight into their decision-making processes during training and deployment phases. We propose the use of a hierarchical architecture with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) for explainable multiclass classification of neural states. This approach provides both local and global explainability and is suitable for identifying neurophysiological biomarkers, for assessing models based on established domain knowledge during development, and for validation during deployment. We develop a hierarchical classifier composed of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) for sleep stage classification using rodent electroencephalogram (EEG) data and compare this implementation to a standard multiclass MLP classifier with LRP. The hierarchical classifier obtained explainability results that better aligned with domain knowledge than the standard multiclass classifier. It identified alpha (10-12 Hz), theta (5-9 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) and theta as key features for discriminating awake versus sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) versus non-REM (NREM), respectively. The standard multiclass MLP did not identify any key frequency bands for the NREM and REM classes, but did identify delta (1-4 Hz), theta, and alpha as more important than beta, slow-gamma (31-55 Hz), and fast-gamma (65-100Hz) oscillations. The two methods obtained comparable classification performance. These results suggest that LRP with hierarchical classifiers is a promising approach to identifying biomarkers that differentiate multiple neurophysiological states.

Brain connectivity alterations during sleep by closed-loop transcranial neurostimulation predict metamemory sensitivity	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain stimulation; EEG; Metamemory; Functional connectivity; Graph theory; Sleep	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; METACOGNITIVE ABILITY; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; EPISODIC MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPUS	Metamemory involves the ability to correctly judge the accuracy of our memories. The retrieval of memories can be improved using transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) during sleep, but evidence for improvements to metamemory sensitivity is limited. Applying tES can enhance sleep-dependent memory consolidation, which along with metamemory requires the coordination of activity across distributed neural systems, suggesting that examining functional connectivity is important for understanding these processes. Nevertheless, little research has examined how functional connectivity modulations relate to overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. Here, we developed a closed-loop short-duration tES method, time-locked to up-states of ongoing slow-wave oscillations, to cue specific memory replays in humans. We measured electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence changes following stimulation pulses, and characterized network alterations with graph theoretic metrics. Using machine learning techniques, we show that pulsed tES elicited network changes in multiple frequency bands, including increased connectivity in the theta band and increased efficiency in the spindle band. Additionally, stimulation-induced changes in beta-band path length were predictive of overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. These findings add new insights into the growing literature investigating increases in memory performance through brain stimulation during sleep, and highlight the importance of examining functional connectivity to explain its effects. Author Summary Numerous studies have demonstrated a clear link between sleep and memory-namely, memories are consolidated during sleep, leading to more stable and long-lasting representations. We have previously shown that tagging episodes with specific patterns of brain stimulation during encoding and replaying those patterns during sleep can enhance this consolidation process to improve confidence and decision-making of memories (metamemory). Here, we extend this work to examine network-level brain changes that occur following stimulation during sleep that predict metamemory improvements. Using graph theoretic and machine-learning methods, we found that stimulation-induced changes in beta-band path length predicted overnight improvements in metamemory. This novel finding sheds new light on the neural mechanisms of memory consolidation and suggests potential applications for improving metamemory.

Most of them have focused on the use of physiological signals such as EEG or EMG, cardiovascular measures or skin conductance. However, eye related features have proven to be very helpful and easy to use metrics, especially pupil size and blink activity. The aim of this study is to predict emotional arousal and valence levels which are induced during emotionally charged situations from eye related features. For this reason, we performed an experimental study where the participants watched emotion-eliciting videos and self-assessed their emotions, while their eye movements were being recorded. In this work, several classifiers such as KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Trees and Ensemble methods were trained and tested. Finally, emotional arousal and valence levels were predicted with 85 and 91% efficiency, respectively.

Invariability of EEG error-related potentials during continuous feedback protocols elicited by erroneous actions at predicted or unpredicted states	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						error-related potentials; continuous feedback protocols; asynchronous decoding; transfer learning	BRAIN-ACTUATED WHEELCHAIR; ERP COMPONENTS; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS	Objective. When humans perceive an erroneous action, an EEG error-related potential (ErrP) is elicited as a neural response. ErrPs have been largely investigated in discrete feedback protocols, where actions are executed at discrete steps, to enable seamless brain-computer interaction. However, there are only a few studies that investigate ErrPs in continuous feedback protocols. The objective of the present study is to better understand the differences between two types of ErrPs elicited during continuous feedback protocols, where errors may occur either at predicted or unpredicted states. We hypothesize that ErrPs of the unpredicted state is associated with longer latency as it requires higher cognitive workload to evaluate actions compared to the predicted states. Approach. Participants monitored the trajectory of an autonomous cursor that occasionally made erroneous actions on its way to the target in two conditions, namely, predicted or unpredicted states. After characterizing the ErrP waveform elicited by erroneous actions in the two conditions, we performed single-trial decoding of ErrPs in both synchronous (i.e. time-locked to the onset of the erroneous action) and asynchronous manner. Furthermore, we explored the possibility to transfer decoders built with data of one of the conditions to the other condition. Main results. As hypothesized, erroneous actions at unpredicted states gave rise to ErrPs with higher latency than erroneous actions at predicted states, a correlate of higher cognitive effort in the former condition. Moreover, ErrP decoders trained in a given condition successfully transferred to the other condition with a slight loss of classification performance. This was the case for synchronous as well as asynchronous ErrP decoding, showing the invariability of ErrPs across conditions. Significance. These results advance the characterization of ErrPs during continuous feedback protocols, enlarging the potential use of ErrPs during natural operation of brain-controlled devices as it is not necessary to have different decoders for each kind of erroneous conditions.

The doctors generally perform diagnosis of based on visual inspection of these physiological signals. Such type of diagnosis procedure is very time-consuming specially for long-data recordings. Moreover, such diagnosis approach is subjective in nature and requires an expertise or training. Signal processing methods together with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can help in designing intelligent systems for the automated diagnosis of brain and heart diseases based on these physiological signals. Such AI driven intelligent systems can help doctors in their diagnosis. Moreover, such intelligent systems can detect the diseases at initial level so that timely treatment can be carried out. The various methods which are based on signal processing and machine learning for the brain and heart diseases will be presented in this talk.

Inspired by the leaf homeostasis system, we developed the first homeostatic cellulose biosensor with functions of protection, sensation, self-regulation, and biosafety. Moreover, we find that a mesoporous cellulose membrane transforms into homeostatic material with properties that include high ion conductivity, excellent flexibility and stability, appropriate adhesion force, and self-healing effects when swollen in a saline solution. The proposed biosensor is found to maintain a stable skin-sensor interface through homeostasis even when challenged by various stresses, such as a dynamic environment, severe detachment, dense hair, sweat, and long-term measurement. Last, we demonstrate the high usability of our homeostatic biosensor for continuous and stable measurement of electrophysiological signals and give a showcase application in the field of brain-computer interfacing where the biosensors and machine learning together help to control real-time applications beyond the laboratory at unprecedented versatility.

Why, then, do neural and behavioral responses vary across repeated presentations of the same sensory input? Ongoing fluctuations of neu-ronal excitability are currently hypothesized to underlie the trial-by-trial variability in sensory processing. To test this, we capitalized on intracranial electrophysiology in neurosurgical patients performing an auditory discrim-ination task with visual cues: specifically, we examined the interaction between prestimulus alpha oscillations, excitability, task performance, and decoded neural stimulus representations. We found that strong prestimulus oscillations in the alpha + band (i.e., alpha and neighboring frequencies), rather than the aperiodic signal, corre-lated with a low excitability state, indexed by reduced broadband high-frequency activity. This state was related to slower reaction times and reduced neural stimulus encoding strength. We propose that the alpha + rhythm modulates excitability, thereby resulting in variability in behavior and sensory representations despite identical input.

Fatigue Monitoring Through Wearables: A State-of-the-Art Review	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						fatigue monitoring; wearable; occupational health and safety; signal quality assessment; validation; physiological signal; machine learning; imbalanced datasets	DROWSINESS DETECTION; SYSTEM; EEG; VIGILANCE; DRIVERS; WORK; MANAGEMENT; SLEEPINESS; MODELS; IMPACT	The objective measurement of fatigue is of critical relevance in areas such as occupational health and safety as fatigue impairs cognitive and motor performance, thus reducing productivity and increasing the risk of injury. Wearable systems represent highly promising solutions for fatigue monitoring as they enable continuous, long-term monitoring of biomedical signals in unattended settings, with the required comfort and non-intrusiveness. This is a p rerequisite for the development of accurate models for fatigue monitoring in real-time. However, monitoring fatigue through wearable devices imposes unique challenges. To provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in monitoring variables associated with fatigue via wearables and to detect potential gaps and pitfalls in current knowledge, a systematic review was performed. The Scopus and PubMed databases were searched for articles published in English since 2015, having the terms "fatigue," "drowsiness," "vigilance," or "alertness" in the title, and proposing wearable device-based systems for non-invasive fatigue quantification. Of the 612 retrieved articles, 60 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Included studies were mainly of short duration and conducted in laboratory settings. In general, researchers developed fatigue models based on motion (MOT), electroencephalogram (EEG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), electromyogram (EMG), skin temperature (T-sk), eye movement (EYE), and respiratory (RES) data acquired by wearable devices available in the market. Supervised machine learning models, and more specifically, binary classification models, are predominant among the proposed fatigue quantification approaches. These models were considered to perform very well in detecting fatigue, however, little effort was made to ensure the use of high-quality data during model development. Together, the findings of this review reveal that methodological limitations have hindered the generalizability and real-world applicability of most of the proposed fatigue models. Considerably more work is needed to fully explore the potential of wearables for fatigue quantification as well as to better understand the relationship between fatigue and changes in physiological variables.

The amount of anesthesia given to the patient depends upon the physiological parameters (i.e. electromyography, electrocardiography, electroencephalography) and evaluated by bispectrality index scale, entropy is scrutinized to achieve the goal of anesthesia. It describes the basic terminologies of anesthesia used in a different type of surgery and treatments. It briefly explains the role and classification of anesthesia drugs and their side effect. At last, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling and control of anesthesia are thoroughly reviewed. The use of variables such as electroencephalogram, Bi Spectral Index due to automated monitoring tools controlled by using treatment helps the anesthesiologist. The discussion for practical anesthesiologist are implied with AI classifications with their limitations in clinical care usage.

The non-invasive BCI does not require surgery and has an excellent temporal resolution, which is advantageous for continuously understanding the intention of the user. However, when performing stimuli-based paradigms among several paradigms, there is a disadvantage in that users must constantly concentrate on watching external stimuli displayed on the monitor. Therefore, it is necessary to use an intuitive paradigm. Nevertheless, the intuitive paradigm has rarely been used to control the formation of swarm drones until now. The EEG-based brain-computer interface using intuitive paradigms includes motor imagery, visual imagery, and imagined speech. Thus, by comparing and analyzing four kinds of drone swarm formation control using visual imagery paradigm, we try to find a more efficient method for flight control of swarm drones. As a result, we found that the average of the 4-class classification performance was 76.4% and the highest accuracy was 83% between 8 and 13 Hz. From now on, this study will be a cornerstone for domestic and overseas related research.

Although it is one of the main causes of many road accidents, there is still no reliable definition of drowsiness or a system to reliably detect it. Many researchers have observed correlations between frequency-domain features of the EEG signal and drowsiness, such as an increase in the spectral power of the theta band or a decrease in the spectral power of the beta band. In addition, features calculated as ratio indices between these frequency-domain features show further improvements in detecting drowsiness compared to frequency-domain features alone. This work aims to develop novel multichannel ratio indices that take advantage of the diversity of frequency-domain features from different brain regions. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, we use an evolutionary metaheuristic algorithm to find the nearly optimal set of features and channels from which the indices are calculated. Our results show that drowsiness is best described by the powers in delta and alpha bands. Compared to seven existing single-channel ratio indices, our two novel six-channel indices show improvements in (1) statistically significant differences observed between wakefulness and drowsiness segments, (2) precision of drowsiness detection and classification accuracy of the XGBoost algorithm and (3) model performance by saving time and memory during classification. Our work suggests that a more precise definition of drowsiness is needed, and that accurate early detection of drowsiness should be based on multichannel frequency-domain features.

Autism is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Lack of social interaction, communication problems, and a limited range of behaviors and interests are possible characteristics of autism in children, alongside other symptoms. Electroencephalograms provide useful information about changes in brain activity and hence are efficaciously used for diagnosis of neurological disease. Eighteen nonlinear features were extracted from EEG signals of 40 children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and 37 children with no diagnosis of neuro developmental disorder children. Feature selection was performed using Student's t test, and Marginal Fisher Analysis was employed for data reduction. The features were ranked according to Student's t test. The three most significant features were used to develop the autism index, while the ranked feature set was input to SVM polynomials 1, 2, and 3 for classification. The SVM polynomial 2 yielded the highest classification accuracy of 98.70% with 20 features. The developed classification system is likely to aid healthcare professionals as a diagnostic tool to detect autism. With more data, in our future work, we intend to employ deep learning models and to explore a cloud-based detection system for the detection of autism. Our study is novel, as we have analyzed all nonlinear features, and we are one of the first groups to have uniquely developed an autism (ASD) index using the extracted features.

Automatic detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs, short as 'spikes') from an epileptic brain can help predict seizure recurrence and support the diagnosis of epilepsy. Developing fast, reliable and robust detection methods for IEDs based on scalp or intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) may facilitate online seizure monitoring and closed-loop neurostimulation. Approach. We developed a new deep learning approach, which employs a long short-term memory network architecture ('IEDnet') and an auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (AC-GAN), to train on both expert-annotated and augmented spike events from iEEG recordings of epilepsy patients. We validated our IEDnet with two real-world iEEG datasets, and compared IEDnet with the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers on their detection performances. Main results. IEDnet achieved excellent cross-validated detection performances in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, and outperformed SVM and RF. Synthetic spike samples augmented by AC-GAN further improved the detection performance. In addition, the performance of IEDnet was robust with respect to the sampling frequency and noise. Furthermore, we demonstrated the cross-institutional generalization ability of IEDnet while testing between two datasets. Significance. IEDnet achieves excellent detection performances in identifying interictal spikes. AC-GAN can produce augmented iEEG samples to improve supervised deep learning.

The paradigm of motor imagery is among the ones in these types of systems where the pipeline is tuned to work with only one person as it fails to classify the signals of a different person. Deep Learning methods have been gaining attention for tasks involving high-dimensional unstructured data, like EEG signals, but fail to generalize when trained on small datasets. In this work, to acquire a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of several classifiers while decoding signals from a new subject using a leave-one-out approach. Then we test the classifiers on the previous experiment and a method based on transfer learning in neural networks to classify the signals of multiple persons at a time. The resulting neural network classifier achieves a classification accuracy of 73% on the evaluation sessions of four subjects at a time and 74% on three at a time on the BCI competition IV 2a dataset.

Using an active oddball paradigm with unambiguous and ambiguous portrait paintings as the standard stimuli, our aim was to examine whether: creativity in the figural domain influences the perception of visual stimuli; any stages of visual processing; or if healthy aging has an effect on these processes. We investigated event related potentials (ERPs) and applied ERP decoding analyses in four groups: younger less creative; younger creative; older less creative; and older creative adults. The early visual processing did not differ between creativity groups. In the later ERP stages the amplitude for the creative compared with the less creative groups was larger between 300 and 500 ms. The stimuli types were clearly distinguishable: within the 300-500 ms range the amplitude was larger for ambiguous rather than unambiguous paintings, but this difference in the traditional ERP analysis was only observable in the younger, not elderly groups, who also had this difference when using decoding analysis. Our results could not prove that visual creativity influences the early stage of perception, but showed creativity had an effect on stimulus processing in the 300-500 ms range, in indexing differences in top-down control, and having more flexible cognitive control in the younger creative group.

Such technologies, however, stumble upon the observation that each driver presents a distinct set of behavioral and physiological manifestations of drowsiness, thus rendering its objective assessment a non-trivial process. The AUTOMOTIVE project studied the application of signal processing and machine learning techniques for driver-specific drowsiness detection in smart vehicles, enabled by immersive driving simulators. More broadly, comprehensive research on biometrics using the electrocardiogram (ECG) and face enables the continuous learning of subject-specific models of drowsiness for more efficient monitoring. This paper aims to offer a holistic but comprehensive view of the research and development work conducted for the AUTOMOTIVE project across the various addressed topics and how it ultimately brings us closer to the target of improved driver drowsiness monitoring.

J	Bahador, N; Kortelainen, J				Bahador, Nooshin; Kortelainen, Jukka			Deep learning-based classification of multichannel bio-signals using directedness transfer learning	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Spectral-phase-spatial fusion; Multivariate data; Transfer learning; Deep learning; Bi-dimensional mapping	TIME-SERIES; FUSION; REPRESENTATIONS; RECOGNITION; CNN	The problem with processing of multivariate/multichannel signals lies in adapting of existing classifiers on data. Reformulating time-series data as visual clues and assigning visual patterns to different categories help the classification of time series in a wide range of applications. These series-to-image transformations have benefits including better noise robustness and more options regarding augmentation. They also provide the possibility of achieving discriminative features by employing transfer learning paradigm in cases dealing with highly small training datasets. In this respect, this work aimed to encode spectral-phase information into a bi-dimensional map. Transferring knowledge was done using bi-dimensional transformation capitalizing on the direction and propagation pattern of one channel influence on the others. EEG data from patients diagnosed with delirium (N = 15) recorded using a 10-channel BrainStatus device were used for this analysis. Considering leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, classification outcomes demonstrated that directedness transfer learning via Alexnet yields a promising performance showing 97.17% precision and outperforming other approaches. Comparison with nine different deep networks pretrained on ImageNet database was included. Directedness transfer learning resulted in precision of 95.29 +/- 1.46 (mu +/- sigma)% among all networks. For further evaluation, directedness bi-dimensional transformation was also compared with six other 2D maps. Applying different networks resulted in average precision of (91.99 +/- 2.23)% for polar-, (91.69 +/- 1.57)% for correlation-, (90.46 +/- 1.71)% for Spectrogram-, (87.82 +/- 2.16)% for Wavelet-, (84.24 +/- 1.72)% for Wigner-Ville-and (82.84 +/- 2.46)% for Mel-frequency Cepstrum maps. To conclude, the proposed technique shows significant benefit in compressing spatio-spectral patterns of multichannel signals in just a unified visual representation.

Common and Unique Inhibitory Control Signatures of Action-Stopping and Attentional Capture Suggest That Actions Are Stopped in Two Stages	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attentional capture; EEG; EMG; inhibitory control; motor inhibition; stop signal task	INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; UNEXPECTED EVENTS; SCALP EEG; SUPPRESSION; MODEL; ACTIVATION; MECHANISM	The ability to stop an already initiated action is paramount to adaptive behavior. Much scientific debate in the field of human action-stopping currently focuses on two interrelated questions. (1) Which cognitive and neural processes uniquely underpin the implementation of inhibitory control when actions are stopped after explicit stop signals, and which processes are instead commonly evoked by all salient signals, even those that do not require stopping? (2) Why do purported (neuro) physiological signatures of inhibition occur at two different latencies after stop signals? Here, we address both questions via two preregistered experiments that combined measurements of corticospinal excitability, EMG, and whole-scalp EEG. Adult human subjects performed a stop signal task that also contained "ignore" signals: equally salient signals that did not require stopping but rather completion of the Go response. We found that both stop- and ignore signals produced equal amounts of early-latency inhibition of corticospinal excitability and EMG, which took place -150 ms following either signal. Multivariate pattern analysis of the whole-scalp EEG data further corroborated that this early processing stage was shared between stopand ignore signals, as neural activity following the two signals could not be decoded from each other until a later time period. In this later period, unique activity related to stop signals emerged at frontocentral scalp sites, reflecting an increased stop signal P3. These findings suggest a two-step model of action-stopping, according to which an initial, universal inhibitory response to the saliency of the stop signal is followed by a slower process that is unique to outright stopping.

However, monitoring is also needed in the day-to-day lives of people with epilepsy, where video electroencephalography is not feasible. Wearables could fill this gap by providing patients with an accurate log of their seizures. Objective: Although there are already systems available that provide promising results for the detection of tonic-clonic seizures (TCSs), research in this area is often limited to detection from 1 biosignal modality or only during the night when the patient is in bed. The aim of this study is to provide evidence that supervised machine learning can detect TCSs from multimodal data in a new data set during daytime and nighttime. Methods: An extensive data set of biosignals from a multimodal watch worn by people with epilepsy was recorded during their stay in the epilepsy monitoring unit at 2 European clinical sites. From a larger data set of 243 enrolled participants, those who had data recorded during TCSs were selected, amounting to 10 participants with 21 TCSs. Accelerometry and electrodermal activity recorded by the wearable device were used for analysis, and seizure manifestation was annotated in detail by clinical experts. Ten accelerometry and 3 electrodermal activity features were calculated for sliding windows of variable size across the data. A gradient tree boosting algorithm was used for seizure detection, and the optimal parameter combination was determined in a leave-one-participant-out cross-validation on a training set of 10 seizures from 8 participants. The model was then evaluated on an out-of-sample test set of 11 seizures from the remaining 2 participants. To assess specificity, we additionally analyzed data from up to 29 participants without TCSs during the model evaluation. Results: In the leave-one-participant-out cross-validation, the model optimized for sensitivity could detect all 10 seizures with a false alarm rate of 0.46 per day in 17.3 days of data. In a test set of 11 out-of-sample TCSs, amounting to 8.3 days of data, the model could detect 10 seizures and produced no false positives. Increasing the test set to include data from 28 more participants without additional TCSs resulted in a false alarm rate of 0.19 per day in 78 days of wearable data. Conclusions: We show that a gradient tree boosting machine can robustly detect TCSs from multimodal wearable data in an original data set and that even with very limited training data, supervised machine learning can achieve a high sensitivity and low false-positive rate. This methodology may offer a promising way to approach wearable-based nonconvulsive seizure detection.

However, it is not practical to record EEG data over several long calibration sessions. A promising time- and cost-efficient solution is artificial data generation or data augmentation (DA). Here, we proposed a DA method for the motor imagery (MI) EEG signal called brain-area-recombination (BAR). For the BAR, each sample was first separated into two ones (named half-sample) by left/right brain channels, and the artificial samples were generated by recombining the half-samples. We then designed two schemas (intra- and adaptive-subject schema) corresponding to the single- and multi-subject scenarios. Extensive experiments using the classifier of EEGnet were conducted on two public datasets under various training set sizes. In both schemas, the BAR method can make the EEGnet have a better performance of classification (p < 0.01). To make a comparative investigation, we selected two common DA methods (noise-added and flipping), and the BAR method beat them (p < 0.05). Further, using the proposed BAR for augmentation, EEGnet achieved up to 8.3% improvement than a typical decoding algorithm CSP-SVM (p < 0.01), note that both the models were trained on the augmented dataset. This study shows that BAR usage can significantly improve the classification ability of deep learning to MI-EEG signals. To a certain extent, it may promote the development of deep learning technology in the field of BCI.

Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) assist paralyzed patients by providing access to the world without requiring surgical intervention. Prior work has suggested that EEG motor imagery based BCI can benefit from increased decoding accuracy through the application of deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Approach. Here, we examine whether these improvements can generalize to practical scenarios such as continuous control tasks (as opposed to prior work reporting one classification per trial), whether valuable information remains latent outside of the motor cortex (as no prior work has compared full scalp coverage to motor only electrode montages), and the existing challenges to the practical implementation of deep-learning based continuous BCI control. Main results. We report that: (1) deep learning methods significantly increase offline performance compared to standard methods on an independent, large, and longitudinal online motor imagery BCI dataset with up to 4-classes and continuous 2D feedback; (2) our results suggest that a variety of neural biomarkers for BCI, including those outside the motor cortex, can be detected and used to improve performance through deep learning methods, and (3) tuning neural network output will be an important step in optimizing online BCI control, as we found the CNN models trained with full scalp EEG also significantly reduce the average trial length in a simulated online cursor control environment. Significance. This work demonstrates the benefits of CNNs classification during BCI control while providing evidence that electrode montage selection and the mapping of CNN output to device control will be important design choices in CNN based BCIs.

Exploring the Effects of Music in Participants' Conscious and Brain Activity Responses	EXTENDED ABSTRACTS OF THE 2021 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS (CHI'21)			English	Proceedings Paper	CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	MAY 08-13, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	ACM SIGCHI, Assoc Comp Machinery, Bloomberg, Facebook, Google, Kyocera, Microsoft, Monash Univ, Verizon Media		Binaural Beats; Music Stimuli; Physiological Signals; EEG; Affective Computing; Classification; Emotion Recognition	EMOTION RECOGNITION	Music is a universal medium that can elicit strong emotion, and can significantly help us in gaining focus while doing specific tasks. However, it is unclear what types of music can help to improve focus while doing other activities. In this paper, we investigate the effects of six different music stimuli on participants' verbal and physiological responses while identifying genuine and acted emotions from video clips. Initial analysis was conducted on the comments participants made on the different stimuli in order to identify emerging patterns. Then, participants' verbal and EEG responses were collected, processed and analyzed to classify two types of emotion. Empirical analysis of the results show that binaural beats, which are believed to increase focus on tasks, can often cause discomfort and therefore hinder focus. On the other hand, music containing a sombre tone, or familiar popular music with high level valence can help improve focus. Identifying which music stimuli can improve focus can be highly beneficial in managing day-to-day tasks and activities. This study will also be useful in broadening the range of music stimuli used in affective computing studies.

Research on MI has made significant progress in feature information detection and machine learning decoding algorithms, but there are still problems, such as a low overall recognition rate and large differences in individual execution effects, which make the development of MI run into a bottleneck. Aiming at solving this bottleneck problem, the current study optimized the quality of the MI original signal by "enhancing the difficulty of imagination tasks," conducted the qualitative and quantitative analyses of EEG rhythm characteristics, and used quantitative indicators, such as ERD mean value and recognition rate. Research on the comparative analysis of the lower limb MI of different tasks, namely, high-frequency motor imagination (HFMI) and low-frequency motor imagination (LFMI), was conducted. The results validate the following: the average ERD of HFMI (-1.827) is less than that of LFMI (-1.3487) in the alpha band, so did (-3.4756 < -2.2891) in the beta band. In the alpha and beta characteristic frequency bands, the average ERD of HFMI is smaller than that of LFMI, and the ERD values of the two are significantly different (p=0.0074<0.01; r = 0.945). The ERD intensity STD values of HFMI are less than those of LFMI. which suggests that the ERD intensity individual difference among the subjects is smaller in the HFMI mode than in the LFMI mode. The average recognition rate of HFMI is higher than that of LFMI (87.84% > 76.46%), and the recognition rate of the two modes is significantly different (p=0.0034<0.01; r = 0.429). In summary, this research optimizes the quality of MI brain signal sources by enhancing the difficulty of imagination tasks, achieving the purpose of improving the overall recognition rate of the lower limb MI of the participants and reducing the differences of individual execution effects and signal quality among the subjects.

Recently, speech imagery has been studied for direct communication using language. Speech imagery uses brain signals generated when the user imagines speech. Unlike motor imagery, speech imagery still has unknown characteristics. Additionally, electroencephalography has intricate and non-stationary properties resulting in insufficient decoding performance. In addition, speech imagery is difficult to utilize spatial features. In this study, we designed length- wise training that allows the model to classify a series of a small number of words. In addition, we proposed hierarchical convolutional neural network structure and loss function to maximize the training strategy. The proposed method showed competitive performance in speech imagery classification. Hence, we demonstrated that the length of the word is a clue at improving classification performance.

The ability to automatically detect and monitor seizure progression and postictal state can allow for early warning of seizure onset, timely intervention in seizures themselves, as well as identification of major complications in epilepsy such as status epilepticus and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). To test whether it is possible to reliably differentiate these ictal and postictal states, we investigated 52 seizure records (both intracranial and scalp EEG) from 19 patients. Phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling was calculated for each recording and used as an input to a convolutional neural network model, achieving the mean accuracy of 0.89 +/- 0.09 across all classes, with the worst class accuracy of 0.73 for one of the later ictal sub-states. When the trained model was applied to SUDEP patient data, it classified seizure recordings as primarily interictal and PGES-like state (70% and 26% respectively), highlighting the fact that in SUDEP patients seizures primarily exist in postictal states and don't show the ictal sub-state evolution. These results suggest that using frequency coupling markers with a machine learning algorithm can reliably identify ictal and postictal sub-states, which can open up opportunities for novel monitoring and management approaches in epilepsy.

J	Zheng, X; Chen, WZ				Zheng, Xiao; Chen, Wanzhong			An Attention-based Bi-LSTM Method for Visual Object Classification via EEG	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Deep learning; Attention mechanism; EEG; Bi-LSTM; Visual perception	MODULARITY	Background and Objective: Despite many models have been proposed for brain visual perception and content understanding via electroencephalograms (EEGs), due to the lack of research on the inherent temporal relationship, EEG-based visual object classification still demands the improvement on its accuracy and computation complexity. Methods: To take full advantage of the uneven visual feature saturation between time segments, an end-to-end attention-based Bi-LSTM Method is proposed, named Bi-LSTM-AttGW. Two attention strategies are introduced to Bi-LSTM framework. The attention gate replaces the forget gate in traditional LSTM. It is only relevant to the historical cell state, and not related to the current input. Hence, the attention gate can greatly reduce the number of training parameters. Moreover, the attention weighting method is applied to Bi-LSTM output, and it can explore the most decisive information. Results: The best classification accuracy achieved by Bi-LSTM-AttGW model is 99.50%. Compared with the state-of-art algorithms and baseline models, the proposed method has great advantages in classification performance and computational complexity. Considering brain region level contribution on visual cognition task, we also verify our method using EEG signals collected from the frontal and occipital regions, that are highly correlated with visual perception tasks. Conclusions: The results show promise towards the idea that human brain activity related to visual recognition can be more effectively decoded by neural networks with neural mechanism. The experimental results not only could provide strong support for the modularity theory about the brain cognitive function, but show the superiority of the proposed Bi-LSTM model with attention mechanism again.

Sensitivity and specificity of the driver sleepiness detection methods using physiological signals: A systematic review	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Review						Fatigue; Drowsiness; Driving; Features; Machine learning; Ground truth; Physiological sleepiness	NEUROBEHAVIORAL IMPAIRMENT; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DRIVING PERFORMANCE; REAL ROAD; FATIGUE; ALERTNESS; SIMULATOR; RISK; EEG	Driver sleepiness is a major contributor to road crashes. A system that monitors and warns the driver at a certain, critical level of arousal, could aid in reducing sleep-related crashes. To determine how driver sleepiness detection systems perform, a systematic review of the sensitivity and specificity outcomes was performed. In total, 21 studies were located that met inclusion criteria for the review. The range of sensitivity outcomes was between 39.0-98.8 % and between 73.0-98.9 % for specificity outcomes. There was considerable variation in the outcomes of the studies employing only one physiological measure (mono-signal approach), whereas, a poly-signal approach with multiple physiological signals resulted in more consistency with higher outcomes on both sensitivity and specificity metrics. Only six of the 21 studies had both sensitivity and specificity outcomes above 90.0 %, which included monoand poly-signal approaches. Moreover, increases in the number of features used in the sleepiness detection system did not result in higher sensitivity and specificity outcomes. Overall, there was considerable variability between the studies reviewed, including measures of ground truth, the features employed and the machine learning approach of the systems. A critical need for progressing any system is a revalidation of the system on a new sample of users. These aspects indicate considerable progress is needed with physiological-based driver sleepiness systems before they are at a sufficient standard to be deployed on-road.

Previous investigations have shown that the mechanisms of selective attention contribute to enhancing perception in both simple daily tasks and more complex activities requiring learning new information. Recently, it has been verified that selective attention to target objects and distractor objects is separable in the frequency domain, using Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification. However, discerning dynamics of target and distractor objects in the context of selective attention has not been accomplished yet. This paper extends the investigations on the possible classification and interpretation of distraction and intention solely relying on neural activity (frequency features). In particular, this paper (i) classifies distractor objects vs. target object replicating the LR classification of prior studies, extending the analysis by (ii) interpreting the coefficient weights relating to all features with a focus on N2PC features, and (iii) retrains an LR classifier with the features deemed important by the interpretation analysis. As a result of the interpretation methods, we have successfully decreased the feature size to 7.3% of total features - i.e., from 19,072 to 1,386 features - while recording only a 0.04 loss in performance accuracy score-i.e., from 0.65 to 0.61. Additionally, the interpretation of the classifiers' coefficient weights unveiled new evidence regarding frequency which has been discussed along with the paper.

J	Wang, XK; Huang, S				Wang, Xiaokun; Huang, Shan			Relationship between Artificial Intelligence-Based General Anesthetics and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction	JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING			English	Article								Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) refers to the complications of the central nervous system before and after surgery in patients without mental disorders. Many studies have shown that surgical anesthesia may cause POCD, especially in elderly patients. This article aims to study the relationship between artificial intelligence-based general anesthetics and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This article first describes and classifies artificial intelligence, introduces its realization method, machine learning algorithms, and briefly introduces the basic principles of regression and classification methods in machine learning; then, the principles and techniques of general anesthetics are proposed. The pathogenesis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is explained in detail. Finally, the effect of anesthetics on postoperative cognitive dysfunction is obtained from both inhaled anesthetics and intravenous anesthetics. The impact on postoperative cognitive function is explained. The experimental results in this article show that there is no statistically significant difference in the two groups of patients' age, gender ratio, body mass index, education level, preoperative comorbidities, and other general indicators. Through the use of EEG bispectral index monitors to monitor the depth of anesthesia and postoperative cognitive dysfunction, first, there was no obvious relationship between the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 1, 5, 10, and 50 days and discharge time. The comprehensive monitoring group can reduce the clinical dose of preventive medication and cis-atracurium and shorten the patient's recovery time, extubation time, and recovery time. In addition, it can also reduce the increase of serum protein S100 beta in elderly patients and reduce the incidence of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

J	Ozbek, L				Ozbek, Levent			A study on decomposing EEGs during sleep into frequency components and revealing spindles using Kalman filter	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article						EEG; Sleep; Spindle; Kalman filter; Extended Kalman filter; Adaptive Kalman filter		Sleep scoring in psychiatry is one of the important issues for classification of diseases, investigation of sleep patterns and also appropriate treatment practices. Sleep specialists usually perform manual sleep stage scoring by visually examining the patient's neurophysiological signals collected in sleep laborato-ries. This is not only very difficult but also very time consuming and easing to make mistake task. Sleep spindles are characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures of the sleep of stage-2 non-rapid eye movement. Spindles taking place in sleep regulation and cognitive functions may represent biomarkers of a neuropsychiatric disease. Sleep spindles, which are considered to have an important role in enhancing sleep duration, are characteristic waveforms seen in the non-REM sleep phase. The detection and analysis of the waveforms of the spindles, as well as determining the time and duration of the spindles, are very important to fully understand the process of sleep. However, as the spindles have transient properties compared to background EEG signals, it becomes difficult to analyze and distinguish them visually. There are automatic spindle detection methods (ASDM). But there is no consensus on the usage of these au-tomated methods since they are not robust especially in different characteristics of the spindles. In this study, raw sleep EEG data is taken as a time-series data and it is used without any pre-processing (with-out filtering). Adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), a recursive estimation method, is used to separate this time series data into trend, cycle and drift components. In the zones where the psychiatrist or an expert in sleep scoring specifies the occurrence of the spindles, the trend and cycle values obtained by using AEKF are also indicating the occurrences of the spindles very clearly in the same zones. Also, the estimation of the cycle gives some information about the starting point of the spindle. Just by viewing both raw data and trend and cycle components, the expert can easily recognize whether there is a spindle or not. Therefore, the main contribution of this article is to suggest a more effective methodology for de-tecting spindles. The estimation results support the methodology used in this article. Such a finding also shows that the nonlinear state-space model and the AEKF can be properly applied in similar frameworks. In particular, this study separates EEG signals into trend and cycle components, where the methodology allows for system parameters and the components to be estimated simultaneously. Since the methodol-ogy allows for the parameters to vary over time, observing the time patterns of the estimated parameters have the potential to reveal further information about the sleep process.

Unfortunately, did not get much attention in past decades due to the unavailability of databases with seizure type marking. Seizure types not only assists the neurologist in deciding the correct drug and its dosage but precaution the epileptic patients about the seizure attack and its severity. In the recent past, a significant contribution has been made by applying machine and deep learning algorithms to the binary classification of generalized seizures. This work proposes and implements an early diagnostic and management (EDM) system to assist the neurologist in type identification (5-classes) of the seizure activity at run time and also features an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). In the GUI, temporal, spectral (along with source localization) and spatial plots can be viewed along with the seizure data classified based on its types. The system utilizes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and k-nearest neighbour, (KNN) based on feature extraction and classification, respectively. The system is validated using 31 patients' recordings from Temple University Hospital (TUH) EEG Database. Our system achieves a 5-class classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 97.7%, 92.9%, and 98.7%, respectively, for patient-wise cross-validation.

MBFerns: classification and extraction of actionable knowledge using Multi-Branch Ferns-based Naive Bayesian classifier	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Classification; Multi-Branch Ferns; Naive Bayesian model; Actionable knowledge		Classification is one of the tasks that are most frequently carried out in real world applications. A large number of techniques have been developed based on statistics and machine learning methods. These classification techniques usually suffer from various limitations, and there is no single technique that works best for all classification problems. Two major drawbacks in existing techniques are accuracy and lack of actionable knowledge from results. To overcome these problems, a novel algorithm called Multi-Branch Ferns (MBFerns), and R-package has been developed to build multi-branch ferns (multi-branch decision tree) and to generate key features from training dataset employing Naive Bayesian probabilistic model as classifier. The proposed algorithm performs well for general classification problems and extracting actionable knowledge from training data. The proposed method has been evaluated with best existing classification methods namely, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on medical benchmark data, available at such as Breast Cancer, Cryotherapy, Cardiotocography, Dermatology, Echocardiogram, EEG Eye State, Fertility, Haberman's Survival, Hepatitis, Indian Liver Patient, Mammographic Mass, Parkinsons, etc. Detailed investigation on proposed Multi-Branch Ferns (MBFerns) with respect to accuracy, time, space complexity and knowledge discovery has also been presented.

JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						steady-state motion visual evoked potential; sensorimotor rhythm; brain&#8211; computer interface		Objective. Different visual stimuli might have different effects on the brain, e.g. the change of brightness, non-biological movement and biological movement. Approach. In this study, flicker, checkerboard and gaiting stimuli were chosen as visual stimuli to investigate whether steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) effect on the sensorimotor area for rehabilitation. The gaiting stimulus was designed as the gaiting sequence of a human. The hypothesis is that only observing the designed gaiting stimulus would simultaneously induce: (1) SSMVEP in the occipital area, similarly to an SSVEP stimulus; and (2) sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) in the primary sensorimotor area, because such action observation could activate the mirror neuron system. Canonical correlation analysis was used to detect SSMVEP from occipital electroencephalograms (EEG), and event-related spectral perturbation was used to identify SMR in the EEG from the sensorimotor area. Main results. The results showed that the designed gaiting stimulus-induced SSMVEP, with classification accuracies of 88.9 +/- 12.0% in a four-class scenario. More importantly, it induced clear and sustained event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), while no ERD/ERS could be observed when the other two SSVEP stimuli were used. Further, for participants with a sufficiently clear SSMVEP pattern (classification accuracy >85%), the ERD index values in the mu-beta band induced by the proposed gaiting stimulus were statistically different from those of the other two types of stimulus. Significance. Therefore, a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) based on the designed stimulus has potential in neurorehabilitation applications because it simultaneously has the high accuracy of an SSMVEP (sim90% accuracy in a four-class setup) and the ability to activate the sensorimotor area.

J.; Wei, Joel Koh En; Jahmunah, V; Oh, Shu Lih; Acharya, U. Rajendra; Fung, Daniel Shuen Sheng			Automated detection of conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder using decomposition and nonlinear techniques with EEG signals	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Attention deficit hyperactive disorder; Conduct disorder; Nonlinear features; Sequential forward selection; K-fold validation; Classifiers; Machine learning		Background and objectives: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often presented with conduct disorder (CD). There is currently no objective laboratory test or diagnostic method to discern between ADHD and CD, and diagnosis is further made difficult as ADHD is a common neuro-developmental disorder often presenting with other co-morbid difficulties; and in particular with conduct disorder which has a high degree of associated behavioural challenges. A novel automated system (AS) is proposed as a convenient supplementary tool to support clinicians in their diagnostic decisions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to develop an automated classification system to classify ADHD, CD and ADHD + CD classes using brain signals. Methods: The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods were employed to decompose the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Autoregressive modelling coefficients and relative wavelet energy were then computed on the signals. Various nonlinear features were extracted from the decomposed coefficients. Adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) was then employed to balance the dataset. The significant features were selected using sequential forward selection method. The highly discriminatory features were subsequently fed to an array of classifiers. Results: The highest accuracy of 97.88% was achieved with the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier. The proposed system was developed using ten-fold validation strategy on EEG data from 123 children. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to develop an AS for the classification of ADHD, CD and ADHD + CD classes using EEG signals. Potential application: Our AS can potentially be used as a web-based application with cloud system to aid the clinical diagnosis of ADHD and/or CD, thus supporting faster and accurate treatment for the children. It is important to note that testing with larger data is required before the AS can be employed for clinical applications. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Polysomnography (PSG) is typically used as a reference standard for the diagnosis of OSA which uses different physiological signals such as Electrocardiography (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electromyogram (EMG) in a sleep laboratory. This procedure is time-consuming, expensive and inconvenient. However, detection of OSA by using a wearable sensor to collect Electrocardiography (ECG) signals is a practical and effective alternative. Previous studies of OSA classification from ECG signals focused on feature engineering methods which involves extracting specific features from ECG signals and using the extracted feature as inputs to the machine learning methods. In this study, we propose a novel method of OSA classification of ECG signal where deep learning methods automatically extract the features from the ECG signals and classify them. Our deep learning approach uses a hybrid model involving Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database is used for training and evaluation of our proposed deep learning model. For the released training dataset, our proposed model achieves the accuracy of 94.27%, sensitivity of 94.57%, specificity of 93.93% and F1 score of 95.41%. While for the testing dataset, the achieved accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score for the proposed model are 90.92%, 91.24%, 90.36% and 92.76% respectively. The performance of our model is compared with state of the art techniques and we found our model to achieve the best performance to classify OSA and health ECG signals.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the origin and prognosis of TLE, and the stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) features. Methods: Thirty patients with TLE, who underwent surgical treatment in our functional neurosurgery department from January 2016 to December 2017, were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy after an invasive pre-operative evaluation with SEEG. Depending on the epileptic focus location, patients were divided into those with medial temporal lobe seizures (MTLS) and those with lateral temporal lobe seizures (LTLS). The Engel classification was used to evaluate operation effectiveness, and the Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to detect seizure-free duration. Results: The mean follow-up time was 25.7 +/- 4.8 months. Effectiveness was 63.3% for Engel I (n = 19), 13.3% for Engel II, 3.3% for Engel III, and 20.0% for Engel IV. According to the SEEG, 60.0% (n = 18) had MTLS, and 40.0% (n = 12) had LTLS. Compared with the MTLS group, the operation age of those with LTLS was significantly greater (26.9 +/- 6.9 vs. 29.9 +/- 12.5 years, t = -0.840, P = 0.009) with longer epilepsy duration (11.9 +/- 6.0 vs. 17.9 +/- 12.1 years, t = -1.801, P = 0.038). Patients with MTLS had a longer time interval between ictal onset to seizure (67.3 +/- 59.1 s vs. 29.3 +/- 24.4 s, t = 2.017, P = 0.008). The most common SEEG ictal pattern was a sharp/spike-wave rhythm in the MTLS group (55.6%) and low-voltage fast activity in the LTLS group (58.3%). Compared with the LTLS group, patients with MTLS had a more favorable prognosis (41.7% vs. 77.8%, P = 0.049). Post-operative recurrence was more likely to occur within three months after the operation for both groups, and there appeared to be a stable long-term outcome. Conclusion: Patients with MTLS, who accounted for three-fifths of patients with TLE, showed a more favorable surgical outcome.

In this regard, the current study intended, first, to use time-frequency ridge mapping in exploring the use of fused information from joint EEG-ECG recordings in tracking the transition between different states of anesthesia. Second, it investigated the effectiveness of pre-trained state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for learning discriminative features in the fused data in order to classify the states during anesthesia. Experimental data from healthy-brain patients undergoing operation (N = 20) were used for this study. Data was recorded from the BrainStatus device with single ECG and 10 EEG channels. The obtained results support the hypothesis that not only can ridge fusion capture temporal-spectral progression patterns across all modalities and channels, but also this simplified interpretation of time-frequency representation accelerates the training process and yet improves significantly the efficiency of deep models. Classification outcomes demonstrates that this fusion could yields a better performance, in terms of 94.14% precision and 0.28 s prediction time, compared to commonly used datalevel fusing methods. To conclude, the proposed fusion technique provides the possibility of embedding timefrequency information as well as spatial dependencies over modalities and channels in just a 2D array. This integration technique shows significant benefit in obtaining a more unified and global view of different aspects of physiological data at hand, and yet maintaining the desired performance level in decision making.

Due to the widespread of sensors in pervasive and distributed networks, power consumption, processing speed, and system adaptation are vital in future smart wearable devices. The visioning and forecasting of how to bring computation to the edge in smart sensors have already begun, with an aspiration to provide adaptive extreme edge computing. Here, we provide a holistic view of hardware and theoretical solutions toward smart wearable devices that can provide guidance to research in this pervasive computing era. We propose various solutions for biologically plausible models for continual learning in neuromorphic computing technologies for wearable sensors. To envision this concept, we provide a systematic outline in which prospective low power and low latency scenarios of wearable sensors in neuromorphic platforms are expected. We successively describe vital potential landscapes of neuromorphic processors exploiting complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS) and emerging memory technologies (e.g., memristive devices). Furthermore, we evaluate the requirements for edge computing within wearable devices in terms of footprint, power consumption, latency, and data size. We additionally investigate the challenges beyond neuromorphic computing hardware, algorithms and devices that could impede enhancement of adaptive edge computing in smart wearable devices.

This communication is conducted by analyzing brain signals, so extracting and selecting those features of the brain signals that distinguish between humans' different activities are essentially important. In this study, first, the brain signal is divided into frequency sub-bands using ConstantQ filters, which allows achieving better frequency resolution in lower frequencies and also the better temporal resolution in higher frequencies. Then, appropriate features in temporal, spatial, and spectral domains are extracted from the considered frequency sub-bands to improve the motor imagery classification. Three different ranking methods including Fisher's method, ReliefF, and mRMR are used to select the features; due to their specific criteria, they can help the best selection for the motor imagery classification. Finally, the results obtained from the selection stage are fused using the Dempster-Shafer evidence method. The proposed technique is applied to the BCI 2008-2b competition dataset, which achieves a Kappa score of 0.718. The results show the capability and excellent performance of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art studies.

Feature selection (FS) problem has been solved by many various methods. Among these methods, especially evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have gained a lot of attention in recent years. However, there are very few studies in the literature that consider FS problem as a multi-objective problem to find the optimal trade-off between classification accuracy and the number of selected features. Therefore, in this paper, a non-dominated sorting multi-objective symbiotic organism search (NSMOSOS) algorithm is proposed to generate the optimal feature subset in BCI. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm as a feature selection method is investigated in two datasets based on motor imagery. The highest classification accuracies of NSMOSOS for dataset 1 and dataset 2 are obtained 97.86% with 11 features and 96.57% with average 19 features, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfying results with regard to both the classification accuracy improvement and feature reduction rates for both datasets. The superiority of the proposed method is verified compared with the existing methods for both datasets. Besides, three different versions of symbiotic search organism (SOS) algorithm are improved, and pros and cons of these algorithms are evaluated compared with each other. In conclusion, the paper indicates that the proposed NSMOSOS algorithm is an efficient and practicable technique for FS problem and could be helpful in developing the BCI applications.

Prior efforts resulted to fairly accurate but unstable models. This article investigates what ensemble method is most suitable for developing an ensemble trust classifier model for assessing users trust in technology with psychophysiological signals. Using a self-driving car game, a within subject four condition experiment was implemented. During which 31 participant were involved, and multimodal psychophysiological data (EEG, ECG, EDA, and Facial-EMG) were recorded. An exhaustive 172 features from time and frequency domain were extracted. Six carefully selected algorithms were combined for developing ensemble trust classifier models using each of the four ensemble methods (voting, bagging, stacking, boosting). The result indicated that the Stack ensemble method was more superior, despite voting method dominating prior studies.	[Ben.

This report presents an important proof of concept that acoustic output can be reconstructed on the basis of neural signals, and serves as a valuable step in the development of neuroprostheses to help nonverbal patients interact with their environment. Speech neuroprosthetics aim to provide a natural communication channel to individuals who are unable to speak due to physical or neurological impairments. Real-time synthesis of acoustic speech directly from measured neural activity could enable natural conversations and notably improve quality of life, particularly for individuals who have severely limited means of communication. Recent advances in decoding approaches have led to high quality reconstructions of acoustic speech from invasively measured neural activity. However, most prior research utilizes data collected during open-loop experiments of articulated speech, which might not directly translate to imagined speech processes. Here, we present an approach that synthesizes audible speech in real-time for both imagined and whispered speech conditions. Using a participant implanted with stereotactic depth electrodes, we were able to reliably generate audible speech in real-time. The decoding models rely predominately on frontal activity suggesting that speech processes have similar representations when vocalized, whispered, or imagined. While reconstructed audio is not yet intelligible, our real-time synthesis approach represents an essential step towards investigating how patients will learn to operate a closed-loop speech neuroprosthesis based on imagined speech.

However, current approaches practiced in computing education research (CER) are not sufficient to capture information beyond the basic programming process data (i.e., IDE-log data). Therefore, how cognition and affect intertwine and unfold over time in programming problem-solving activities are rarely investigated. Objectives In this study, we examined how the theory-informed measures from multimodal data that we have selected as proxies for cognitive and affective dimensions of learning, are associated with student performance, and in comparison, to prior-knowledge. Methods A high-frequency temporal data was collected with a camera, an electroencephalogram, and an eye-tracker from 40 computer science students (bachelor and master studies) in the context of a code-debugging activity. To study the cognitive processes associated with learning we focused on cognitive load theory (CLT) and the human information processing model. In addition, we complemented CLT with the model of affective dynamics in learning to avoid the machine reductionism perspective. Results Our findings demonstrated that attention, convergent thinking, and frustration were positively correlated with students' successful code-debugging (i.e., performance), and frequently manifested by high performing participants. Cognitive load, memory load, and boredom were negatively correlated with students' performance, and typically manifested by low performing participants. Implications Extending the context of analysis in reference to student cognitive processes and affective states, affords educators not just to identify lower performers, but also to understand the potential reasons behind their performance, making our method an important contribution in the confluence of CER and the learning technology communities. In addition, the insights extracted from our analyses allow us to discuss potential avenues for improving learning design and the design of interactive learning systems to support the development of students' problem-solving skills.

In the present pilot study, we analyzed EEG signals and the heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) in a sample of 11 patients undergoing spinal surgery to investigate their CNS and ANS activities during GA obtained with propofol administration. Data were analyzed during different stages of GA: baseline, the first period of anesthetic induction, the period before the loss of consciousness, the first period after propofol discontinuation, and the period before the recovery of consciousness (ROC). In EEG spectral analysis, we found a decrease in posterior alpha and beta power in all cortical areas observed, except the occipital ones, and an increase in delta power, mainly during the induction phase. In EEG connectivity analysis, we found a significant increase of local efficiency index in alpha and delta bands between baseline and loss of consciousness as well as between baseline and ROC in delta band only and a significant reduction of the characteristic path length in alpha band between the baseline and ROC. Moreover, connectivity results showed that in the alpha band there was mainly a progressive increase in the number and in the strength of incoming connections in the frontal region, while in the beta band the parietal region showed mainly a significant increase in the number and in the strength of outcoming connections values. The HRV analysis showed that the induction of anesthesia with propofol was associated with a progressive decrease in complexity and a consequent increase in the regularity indexes and that the anesthetic procedure determined bradycardia which was accompanied by an increase in cardiac sympathetic modulation and a decrease in cardiac parasympathetic modulation during the induction. Overall, the results of this pilot study showed as propofol-induced anesthesia caused modifications on EEG signal, leading to a "rebalance" between long and short-range cortical connections, and had a direct effect on the cardiac system. Our data suggest interesting perspectives for the interactions between the central and autonomic nervous systems for the modulation of the consciousness level.

Method: A retrospective, descriptive, multicenter study was conducted evaluating 46 patients with SLECTS who had seizures with an unusual semiology. We collected data from patients with SLECTS seen at eight Argentine centers between April 1998 and April 2018. Results: Thirteen patients (28.2 %) had seizures with affective symptoms characterized by sudden fright and autonomic disturbances and mild impairment of consciousness. Eleven patients (24.8 %) had frequent seizures characterized by unilateral facial sensorimotor symptoms, oropharyngolaryngeal manifestations, and speech arrest with sialorrhea only when awake. Seven patients (15.3 %) started with opercular epileptic status with unilateral or bilateral clonic seizures of the mouth with speech arrest and sialorrhea when awake and during sleep. Seven patients (15.3 %) had postictal Todd's paralysis after unilateral clonic seizures with facial and limb movements lasting between 60 min and 130 min. Six patients (13 %) had negative myoclonus, two in a unilateral upper limb, two in a unilateral lower limb, and the remaining two patients had frequent falls. One patient (2.1 %) had focal sensorimotor seizures characterized by unilateral numbness in the cheeks and one upper limb, additional to unilateral facial clonic seizures, speech arrest, and sialorrhea. The remaining patient (2.1 %) had sporadic focal tonic-dystonic seizures in the left upper limb only during sleep. Conclusion: In our study, we found evidence of the existence of unusual clinical cases of SLECTS with typical EEG patterns and an excellent prognosis.

However, the CSP method has some deficiencies that limit its beneficiary. First, this method is not useful when data is noisy, and it is necessary to have a large dataset because CSP is inclined to overfit. Second, the CSP method uses just the spatial information of the data, and it cannot incorporate the temporal and spectral information. In this paper, we propose a new CSP-based algorithm which is capable of employing the information in all dimensions of data. Also, by defining the regularization term for each mode of information, we can diminish the noise effects and overfitting aspects. We design a simple mathematical framework (called RCTP) to obtain multiple filters of each subspace of information simultaneously. We evaluated our method on 6 subject's data recorded in a Rapid Serial Presentation (RSVP) speller paradigm. The average accuracy of 91.7% and 90.2% is achieved for RCTP and RBCSP methods, respectively. By comparing the obtained results with those of the conventional CSP, it can be shown that the average test accuracy achieved by the proposed RCTP method is 32.1% higher than that of the conventional CSP method. The proposed method can achieve high classification accuracy by defining the regularization terms and using all information of the data.

Using sensor-fusion and machine-learning algorithms to assess acute pain in non-verbal infants: a study protocol	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						neonatology; pain management; paediatrics	SKIN BLOOD-FLOW; PROCEDURAL PAIN; NEONATAL PAIN; PERSISTENT PAIN; CHILDREN BORN; REFLECT PAIN; CONDUCTANCE; PRETERM; STRESS; ANALGESIA	Introduction Objective pain assessment in non-verbal populations is clinically challenging due to their inability to express their pain via self-report. Repetitive exposures to acute or prolonged pain lead to clinical instability, with long-term behavioural and cognitive sequelae in newborn infants. Strong analgesics are also associated with medical complications, potential neurotoxicity and altered brain development. Pain scores performed by bedside nurses provide subjective, observer-dependent assessments rather than objective data for infant pain management; the required observations are labour intensive, difficult to perform by a nurse who is concurrently performing the procedure and increase the nursing workload. Multimodal pain assessment, using sensor-fusion and machine-learning algorithms, can provide a patient-centred, context-dependent, observer-independent and objective pain measure. Methods and analysis In newborns undergoing painful procedures, we use facial electromyography to record facial muscle activity-related infant pain, ECG to examine heart rate (HR) changes and HR variability, electrodermal activity (skin conductance) to measure catecholamine-induced palmar sweating, changes in oxygen saturations and skin perfusion, and electroencephalography using active electrodes to assess brain activity in real time. This multimodal approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of pain assessment in non-verbal infants and may even allow continuous pain monitoring at the bedside. The feasibility of this approach will be evaluated in an observational prospective study of clinically required painful procedures in 60 preterm and term newborns, and infants aged 6 months or less. Ethics and dissemination The Institutional Review Board of the Stanford University approved the protocol. Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, taught via webinars, podcasts and video tutorials, and listed on academic/scientific websites. Future studies will validate and refine this approach using the minimum number of sensors required to assess neonatal/infant pain.

Nonstationary of EEG data and long BCIs' calibration time are main problems that affect the practicability of MIBCI. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, i.e. spatio-time-frequency joint sparse optimization algorithm with transfer learning (STFSTL) to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy with small training set. By introducing artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), the algorithm optimized parameters in spatial domain, time domain and frequency domain simultaneously. The similarity between data was measured by Euclidean distance. Through instanced-based transfer learning, the source data which was most similar to the target data was selected as the auxiliary data to train the target classifier. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm on three data sets, including a private data set and two public data sets. The classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm with one fifth of the training data was higher than that of five other algorithms. Paired t-test analysis revealed that the accuracy of STFSTL and that of five other algorithms were significantly different. The experimental results suggested that the proposed algorithm with less target data can effectively achieve higher classification accuracy than traditional algorithms. It's likely to have a broad application prospect in MI-BCI.

Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic or Periodic Intermittent Discharges (SIRPIDs) in patients with triphasic waves and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Review						SIRPIDs; Triphasic Waves; Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; Sleep-wake cycle; Sleep-to-wake transition; Cyclic alternating pattern	SERIAL EEG FINDINGS; HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; SLEEP; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	Since the term Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic, Periodic, or Ictal Discharges (SIRPIDs) was introduced into the vocabulary of electrophysiologists/neurologists, there has been an ongoing debate about its significance, as well as its correlation with outcomes. SIRPIDs are frequently seen in patients who are critically ill from various causes. The literature reflects the findings of triphasic morphology, with the generalized periodic discharge (GPD) classification in many patients with SIRPIDs: toxic/metabolic encephalopathies, septic, and hypoxemic/hypercapnic encephalopathies, but also sharp periodic complexes in CreutzfeldtJakob disease and advanced Alzheimer's disease. In these settings, GPDs disappear when patients fall asleep and reappear when patients spontaneously wake up, or are awoken by an external stimulus, or sometimes because of a respiratory event, with the possibility of the appearance of GPDs with a cyclic alternating pattern. SIRPIDs may be seen as a transitional pattern between sleep and waking states, corresponding to a postarousal/awakening phenomenon. As SIRPIDs are a transient phenomenon and can usually be recorded repeatedly with each stimulation, the word "Ictal" could be replaced by "Intermittent": Stimulus-Induced Rhythmic or Periodic Intermittent Discharges. However, considering that SIRPIDs may be "potentially ictal" or on an "ictal-interictal continuum`` in some situations, the "plus" modifier may be added: SIRPIDs-plus.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show promise as a direct line of communication between the brain and the outside world that could benefit those with impaired motor function. But the commands available for BCI operation are often limited by the ability of the decoder to differentiate between the many distinct motor or cognitive tasks that can be visualized or attempted. Simple binary command signals (e.g. right hand at rest versus movement) are therefore used due to their ability to produce large observable differences in neural recordings. At the same time, frequent command switching can impose greater demands on the subject's focus and takes time to learn. Here, we attempt to decode the degree of effort in a specific movement task to produce a graded and more flexible command signal. Approach. Fourteen healthy human subjects (nine male, five female) responded to visual cues by squeezing a hand dynamometer to different levels of predetermined force, guided by continuous visual feedback, while the electroencephalogram (EEG) and grip force were monitored. Movement-related EEG features were extracted and modeled to predict exerted force. Main results. We found that event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the 8-30 Hz mu-beta sensorimotor rhythm of the EEG is separable for different degrees of motor effort. Upon four-fold cross-validation, linear classifiers were found to predict grip force from an ERD vector with mean accuracies across subjects of 53% and 55% for the dominant and non-dominant hand, respectively. ERD amplitude increased with target force but appeared to pass through a trough that hinted at non-monotonic behavior. Significance. Our results suggest that modeling and interactive feedback based on the intended level of motor effort is feasible. The observed ERD trends suggest that different mechanisms may govern intermediate versus low and high degrees of motor effort. This may have utility in rehabilitative protocols for motor impairments.

Recently, deep learning techniques have spotlighted the state-of-the-art of MI-based BCIs. These techniques still lack strategies to quantify predictive uncertainty and may produce overconfident predictions. In this work, methods to enhance the performance of existing MI-based BCIs are proposed in order to obtain a more reliable system for real application scenarios. First, the Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) method is proposed on MI deep neural models to improve classification and provide uncertainty estimation. This approach was implemented using Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN-MCD) and with an ensemble model (E-SCNN-MCD). As another contribution, to discriminate MI task predictions of high uncertainty, a threshold approach is introduced and tested for both SCNN-MCD and E-SCNN-MCD approaches. The BCI Competition IV Databases 2a and 2b were used to evaluate the proposed methods for both subject-specific and non-subject-specific strategies, obtaining encouraging results for MI recognition.

At the same time, these systems aim to maintain or even increase productivity. The challenges risen from these developments can be tackled through human-robot collaboration (HRC). HRC requires effective task distribution according to each party's distinctive strengths, which is envisioned to generate synergetic effects. To enable a seamless collaboration, the human and robot require a mutual awareness, which is challenging, due to the human and robot "speaking" different languages as in analogue and digital. This challenge can be addressed by equipping the robot with a model of the human. Despite a range of models being available, data-driven models of the human are still at an early stage. For this purpose, this paper proposes an adaptive human sensor framework, which incorporates objective, subjective, and physiological metrics, as well as associated machine learning. Thus, it is envisioned to adapt to the uniqueness and dynamic nature of human behavior. To test the framework, a validation experiment was performed, including 18 participants, which aims to predict perceived workload during two scenarios, namely a manual and an HRC assembly task. Perceived workloads are described to have a substantial impact on a human operator's task performance. Throughout the experiment, physiological data from an electroencephalogram (EEG), an electrocardiogram (ECG), and respiration sensor was collected and interpreted. For subjective metrics, the standardized NASA Task Load Index was used. Objective metrics included task completion time and number of errors/assistance requests. Overall, the framework revealed a promising potential towards an adaptive behavior, which is ultimately envisioned to enable a more effective HRC.

Modeling Mine Workforce Fatigue: Finding Leading Indicators of Fatigue in Operational Data Sets	MINERALS			English	Article						machine learning; mine worker fatigue; random forest model; health and safety management	CONSTRUCTION; IOT	Mine workers operate heavy equipment while experiencing varying psychological and physiological impacts caused by fatigue. These impacts vary in scope and severity across operators and unique mine operations. Previous studies show the impact of fatigue on individuals, raising substantial concerns about the safety of operation. Unfortunately, while data exist to illustrate the risks, the mechanisms and complex pattern of contributors to fatigue are not understood sufficiently, illustrating the need for new methods to model and manage the severity of fatigue's impact on performance and safety. Modern technology and computational intelligence can provide tools to improve practitioners' understanding of workforce fatigue. Many mines have invested in fatigue monitoring technology (PERCLOS, EEG caps, etc.) as a part of their health and safety control system. Unfortunately, these systems provide "lagging indicators" of fatigue and, in many instances, only provide fatigue alerts too late in the worker fatigue cycle. Thus, the following question arises: can other operational technology systems provide leading indicators that managers and front-line supervisors can use to help their operators to cope with fatigue levels? This paper explores common data sets available at most modern mines and how these operational data sets can be used to model fatigue. The available data sets include operational, health and safety, equipment health, fatigue monitoring and weather data. A machine learning (ML) algorithm is presented as a tool to process and model complex issues such as fatigue. Thus, ML is used in this study to identify potential leading indicators that can help management to make better decisions. Initial findings confirm existing knowledge tying fatigue to time of day and hours worked. These are the first generation of models and future models will be forthcoming.	[Talebi, Elaheh; Rogers, W.

However, clear neurophysiological markers that would identify at-risk individuals represent still an unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate possible alterations in the resting alpha oscillatory activity in normal population high on schizotypy trait, a physiological condition known to be severely altered in patients with schizophrenia. Direct comparison of resting-state EEG oscillatory activity between Low and High Schizotypy Group (LSG and HSG) has revealed a clear right hemisphere alteration in alpha activity of the HSG. Specifically, HSG shows a significant slowing down of right hemisphere posterior alpha frequency and an altered distribution of its amplitude, with a tendency towards a reduction in the right hemisphere in comparison to LSG. Furthermore, altered and reduced connectivity in the right fronto-parietal network within the alpha range was found in the HSG. Crucially, a trained pattern classifier based on these indices of alpha activity was able to successfully differentiate HSG from LSG on tested participants further confirming the specific importance of right hemispheric alpha activity and intrahemispheric functional connectivity. By combining alpha activity and connectivity measures with a machine learning predictive model optimized in a nested stratified cross-validation loop, current research offers a promising clinical tool able to identify individuals at-risk of developing psychosis (i.e., high schizotypy individuals).

It was observed that a multimodal approach (simultaneous analysis of several complementary modalities) can improve the classification accuracy. We will combine three noninvasive measurement modalities: functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electroencephalography and heart rate variability via ECG. Our aim is to explore neurophysiological correlates of cognitive performance and whether our multimodal approach can aid in early identification of individuals with MCI.Methods and analysisThis study will be a cross-sectional with patients with MCI and healthy controls (HC). The neurophysiological signals will be measured during rest and while performing cognitive tasks: (1) Stroop, (2) N-back and (3) verbal fluency test (VFT). Main aims of statistical analysis are to (1) determine the differences in neurophysiological responses of HC and MCI, (2) investigate relationships between measures of cognitive performance and neurophysiological responses and (3) investigate whether the classification accuracy can be improved by using our multimodal approach. To meet these targets, statistical analysis will include machine learning approaches.This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that applies simultaneously these three modalities in MCI and HC. We hypothesise that the multimodal approach improves the classification accuracy between HC and MCI as compared with a unimodal approach. If our hypothesis is verified, this study paves the way for additional research on multimodal approaches for dementia research and fosters the exploration of new biomarkers for an early detection of nonphysiological age-related cognitive decline.Ethics and disseminationEthics approval was obtained from the local Ethics Committee (reference: 83/19).

This is largely due to methodological reasons. On the one hand, machine learning methods have shown their potential in maximizing performance for user mental states classification. On the other hand, the issues related to the necessary and frequent calibration of algorithms and to the temporal resolution of the measurement (i.e. how long it takes to have a reliable state measure) are still unsolved. This work explores the performances of a passive BCI system for mental effort monitoring consisting of three frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) channels. In particular, three calibration approaches have been tested: an intra-subject approach, a cross-subject approach, and a free-calibration procedure based on the simple average of theta activity over the three employed channels. A Random Forest model has been employed in the first two cases. The results obtained during multi-tasking have shown that the cross-subject approach allows the classification of low and high mental effort with an AUC higher than 0.9, with a related time resolution of 45 seconds. Moreover, these performances are not significantly different from the intra-subject approach although they are significantly higher than the calibration-free approach. In conclusion, these results suggest that a light (three EEG channels) passive BCI system based on a Random Forest algorithm and cross-subject calibration could be a simple and reliable tool for out-of-the-lab employment.

Many existing works include a variety of clinical neurological and psychological examinations, especially computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods based on electroencephalographic (EEG) recording or MRI images by using machine learning (ML) combined with different preprocessing steps such as hippocampus shape analysis, fusion of embedded features, and so on, where EEG dataset used for AD diagnosis is usually is large and complex, requiring extraction of a series of features like entropy features, spectral feature, etc., and it has seldom been applied in the AD detection based on deep learning (DL), while MRI images were suitable for both ML and DL. In terms of the structural MRI brain images, few differences could be found in brain atrophy among the three situations: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Normal Control (NC). On the other hand, DL methods have been used to diagnose AD incorporating MRI images in recent years, but there have not yet been many selective models with very deep layers. In this article, the Gray Matter (GM) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is automatically extracted, which could better distinguish among the three types of situations like AD, MCI, and NC, compared with Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF) and White Matter (WM). Firstly, FMRIB Software Library (FSL) software is utilized for batch processing to remove the skull, cerebellum and register the heterogeneous images, and the SPM + cat12 tool kits in MATLAB is used to segment MRI images for obtaining the standard GM MRI images. Next, the GM MRI images are trained by some new neural networks. The characteristics of the training process are as follows: (1) The Tresnet, as the network that achieves the best classification effect among several new networks in the experiment, is selected as the basic network. (2) A multi-receptive-field mechanism is integrated into the network, which is inspired by neurons that can dynamically adjust the receptive fields according to different stimuli. (3) The whole network is realized by adding multiple channels to the convolutional layer, and the size of the convolution kernel of each channel can be dynamically adjusted. (4) Transfer learning method is used to train the model for speeding up the learning and optimizing the learning efficiency. Finally, we achieve the accuracies of 86.9% for AD vs. NC, 63.2% for AD vs. MCI vs. NC respectively, which outperform the previous approaches. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

While frontal midline theta activity is theorized to be a general marker of the need for cognitive control, a stringent test of this hypothesis would require a quantitative, within-subject comparison of the neural activation patterns indexing many different cognitive control strategies, an experiment lacking in the current literature. We recorded EEG from 176 participants as they performed tasks that tested inhibitory control (Go/Nogo Task), proactive and reactive control (AX-Continuous Performance Task), and resolving response conflict (Global/Local Task-modified Flanker Task). As activity in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency band is thought to be a common signature of cognitive control, we assessed frontal midline theta activation underlying each cognitive control strategy. In all strategies, we found higher frontal midline theta power for trials that required more cognitive control (target conditions) versus control conditions. Additionally, reactive control and inhibitory control had higher theta power than proactive control and response conflict, and proactive control had higher theta power than response conflict. Using decoding analyses, we were able to successfully decode control from target trials using classifiers trained exclusively on each of the other strategies, thus firmly demonstrating that theta representations of cognitive control generalize across multiple cognitive control strategies. Our results confirm that frontal midline theta-band activity is a common mechanism for initiating and executing cognitive control, but theta power also differentiates between cognitive control mechanisms. As theta activation reliably differs depending on the cognitive control strategy employed, future work will need to focus on the differential role of theta in differing cognitive control strategies.

Multi-scale neural decoding and analysis	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						multi-scale analyses; neural decoding; electrophysiology; functional imaging	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; TIME FMRI NEUROFEEDBACK; RESONANCE-IMAGING ACTIVATIONS; STRIATAL DOPAMINE RELEASE; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; REWARD ANTICIPATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS	Objective. Complex spatiotemporal neural activity encodes rich information related to behavior and cognition. Conventional research has focused on neural activity acquired using one of many different measurement modalities, each of which provides useful but incomplete assessment of the neural code. Multi-modal techniques can overcome tradeoffs in the spatial and temporal resolution of a single modality to reveal deeper and more comprehensive understanding of system-level neural mechanisms. Uncovering multi-scale dynamics is essential for a mechanistic understanding of brain function and for harnessing neuroscientific insights to develop more effective clinical treatment. Approach. We discuss conventional methodologies used for characterizing neural activity at different scales and review contemporary examples of how these approaches have been combined. Then we present our case for integrating activity across multiple scales to benefit from the combined strengths of each approach and elucidate a more holistic understanding of neural processes. Main results. We examine various combinations of neural activity at different scales and analytical techniques that can be used to integrate or illuminate information across scales, as well the technologies that enable such exciting studies. We conclude with challenges facing future multi-scale studies, and a discussion of the power and potential of these approaches. Significance. This roadmap will lead the readers toward a broad range of multi-scale neural decoding techniques and their benefits over single-modality analyses. This Review article highlights the importance of multi-scale analyses for systematically interrogating complex spatiotemporal mechanisms underlying cognition and behavior.

In this study, to track the loss of consciousness (LOC) induced by GA, we first developed the multi-channel cross fuzzy entropy method to construct the time-varying networks, whose temporal fluctuations were then explored and quantitatively evaluated. Thereafter, an algorithm was further proposed to detect the time onset at which patients lost their consciousness. The results clarified during the resting state, relatively stable fuzzy fluctuations in multi-channel network architectures and properties were found; by contrast, during the LOC period, the disrupted frontal-occipital connectivity occurred at the early stage, while at the later stage, the inner-frontal connectivity was identified. When specifically exploring the early LOC stage, the uphill of the clustering coefficients and the downhill of the characteristic path length were found, which might help resolve the propofol-induced consciousness fluctuation in patients. Moreover, the developed detection algorithm was validated to have great capacity in exactly capturing the time point (in seconds) at which patients lost consciousness. The findings demonstrated that the time-varying cross-fuzzy networks help decode the GA and are of great significance for developing anesthesia depth monitoring technology clinically.

This study aimed to characterize night-time sleep and its relationship to CBT in ICU patients. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in a 27-bed tertiary adult intensive care unit of 20 mechanically ventilated patients in the weaning stage of their critical illness. The study assessed sleep by polysomnography (PSG) during the evening between 21:00-7:00 hours, nursing interventions using the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS), illness severity using SOFA and APACHE II scores and CBT 24-hour pattern. RESULTS: Patients were awake for approximately half the study period (45.04%. IQR 13.81-77-17) with no REM (0%, IQR 0-0.04%) and median arousals of 19.5/hour (IQR 7.1-40.9). The 24-hour CBT had a rhythmic pattern in 13 (65%) patients with a highly variable phase of median peak time at 17:35 hours (IQR 12:40-19:39). No significant associations were found between CBT rhythmicity, sleep stages, sleep EEG frequency density, illness severity scores or TISS on the day of PSG. There was no relationship between time awake and CBT rhythmicity (P=0.48) or CBT peak time (P=0.82). The relationship between circadian rhythms and sleep patterns in the critically ill is complex. CONCLUSIONS: Patients recovering in ICU commonly have CBT loss of rhythmicity or a significant phase shift with loss of normal night-time patterns of sleep architecture. Appropriate care plans to promote sleep and circadian rhythm require further investigation of contributing factors such as environment, clinical care routines, illness type and severity.

Machine learning model on heart rate variability metrics identifies asymptomatic toddlers exposed to zika virus during pregnancy	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Zika; HRV; ECG; infection; pediatrics	MULTISCALE ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; EEG-ANALYSIS; COMPLEXITY; CLASSIFICATION; DYNAMICS; ENTROPY; INFECTION; PACEMAKER; REFLECT	Objective. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) seems to be prominently neurotropic, there are some reports of involvement of other organs, particularly the heart. Of special concern are those children exposed prenatally to ZIKV and born without microcephaly or other congenital anomalies. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived heart rate variability (HRV) metrics represent an attractive, low-cost, widely deployable tool for early identification of developmental functional alterations in exposed children born without such overt clinical symptoms. We hypothesized that HRV in such children would yield a biomarker of fetal ZIKV exposure. Our objective was to test this hypothesis in young children exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy. Approach. We investigated the HRV properties of 21 children aged 4-25 months from Brazil. The infants were divided into two groups, the ZIKV-exposed (n = 13) and controls (n = 8). Single-channel ECG was recorded in each child at similar to 15 months of age and HRV was analyzed in 5 min segments to provide a comprehensive characterization of the degree of variability and complexity of the heart rate. Main results. Using a cubic support vector machine classifier we identified babies as Zika cases or controls with a negative predictive value of 92% and a positive predictive value of 86%. Our results show that a machine learning model derived from HRV metrics can help differentiate between ZIKV-affected, yet asymptomatic, and non-ZIKV-exposed babies. We identified the box count as the best HRV metric in this study allowing such differentiation, regardless of the presence of microcephaly. Significance. We show that it is feasible to measure HRV in infants and toddlers using a small non-invasive portable ECG device and that such an approach may uncover the memory of in utero exposure to ZIKV.

The new paradigm using only two types of stimuli was designed, and different targets were distinguished by frequency and spatial information. The classification algorithm was developed by introducing filters for frequency bands selection and conducting optimization with common spatial pattern (CSP) on the tactile evoked EEG signals. It features a combination of spatial and frequency information, with the spatial information distinguishing the sites of stimuli and frequency information identifying target stimuli and disturbances. We investigated both electrical stimuli and vibration stimuli, in which only one target site was stimulated in each block. The results demonstrated an average accuracy of 94.88% for electrical stimuli and 95.21% for vibration stimuli, respectively.

In reality, this ability is a complex mechanism which requires thoughts to be translated into words who are further transposed into sounds, a mechanism which involves precise coordination of several muscles and joints. In some cases, this complex mechanism can no longer be performed and may be accompanied by almost complete loss of motor activity such in diseases as: stroke, Lock-Down syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy etc. The most recent method that aims to supplement the speech mechanism is imaginary speech recognition using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, by using complex computing mechanisms like Deep Learning (DL) in order to decode the thoughts. In this paper we aim to recognize three types of clustered phonemes using conventional speech recognition techniques, like Mel-Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We compared four types of features extraction: MFCC, LPC, MFCC + LPC combined into 1-channel matrix and MFCC + LPC combined into a 2-channel matrix. We showed that MFCC coefficients offer a better accuracy than LPC and that concatenating MFCC and LPC into a 2-channel matrix we obtain a better performance than combining them into 1-channel matrix.

Among all, one of the most important areas of generation and processing of time series data plays vital role in medical analysis. In this context, various continuous time series dependent EEG and ECG (electrocardiogram) signals are the most important types of medical signals produced and monitored by doctors. This paper proposes a highly novel and robust approach to analyse and detect ECG signals for tracking of anomalies in the signals using Hybrid Deep Learning Architectures (HDLA). The proposed scheme implements self-supervised pattern recognition using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in terms of autoencoder and decoder. Finally, the proposed scheme is tested on Physio-net data set. The outcome of the model can also handle noise associated with ECG time series signal, it achieves high accuracy and also solves overfitting problems in a robust and efficient manner.

Crosstalk disrupts the production of motor imagery brain signals in brain-computer interfaces	HEALTH INFORMATION SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Rehabilitation; Motor imagery; BCI; EEG; Machine learning; Crosstalk		Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) target specific brain activity for neuropsychological rehabilitation, and also allow patients with motor disabilities to control mobility and communication devices. Motor imagery of single-handed actions is used in BCIs but many users cannot control the BCIs effectively, limiting applications in the health systems. Crosstalk is unintended brain activations that interfere with bimanual actions and could also occur during motor imagery. To test if crosstalk impaired BCI user performance, we recorded EEG in 46 participants while they imagined movements in four experimental conditions using motor imagery: left hand (L), right hand (R), tongue (T) and feet (F). Pairwise classification accuracies of the tasks were compared (LR, LF, LT, RF, RT, FT), using common spatio-spectral filters and linear discriminant analysis. We hypothesized that LR classification accuracy would be lower than every other combination that included a hand imagery due to crosstalk. As predicted, classification accuracy for LR (58%) was reliably the lowest. Interestingly, participants who showed poor LR classification also demonstrated at least one good TR, TL, FR or FL classification; and good LR classification was detected in 16% of the participants. For the first time, we showed that crosstalk occurred in motor imagery, and affected BCI performance negatively. Such effects are effector-sensitive regardless of the BCI methods used; and likely not apparent to the user or the BCI developer. This means that tasks choice is crucial when designing BCI. Critically, the effects of crosstalk appear mitigatable. We conclude that understanding crosstalk mitigation is important for improving BCI applicability.

Preictal states can be apprehended as outliers that differ from an interictal baseline and display clinical changes. We collected daily clinical scores from patients with epilepsy who underwent continuous video-EEG and assessed the ability of several outlier detection methods to identify preictal states. Results from 24 patients suggested that outlying clinical features were suggestive of preictal states and can be identified by statistical methods: AUC = 0.71, 95 % CI = [0.63 - 0.79]; PPV = 0.77, 95 % CI = [0.70 - 0.84]; FPR = 0.31, 95 % CI = [0.21 - 0.44]); and F1 score = 0.74, 95 % CI = [0.64 - 0.81]. Such algorithms could be straightforwardly implemented in a mobile device (e.g., tablet or smartphone), which would allow a longer data collection that could improve prediction performances. Additional clinical - and even multimodal - parameters could identify more subtle physiological modifications.

Single-trial detection of EEG error-related potentials using modified power-law transformation	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Cognitive state; Error-related potential; Power-law; Single-trial detection	BCI; NEGATIVITY	Error processing in the human brain is characterized by a distinct neural response that is elicited when the outcome of an event is not the same as expected. This response is known as error-related potential (ErrP). Detection of error-related potentials from a single-trial data can lead the existing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems one step closer to autonomous system. The non-stationarity of the Electroencephalograph (EEG) signal along with poor spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio make the task of detecting ErrP on a single-trial basis challenging. The objective of this work is to propose a novel ErrP detection method based on temporal domain features of ErrP, particularly, the standard deviation measure. The difference in the standard deviation between the correct and the erroneous trials is verified using a statistical test and this information is subsequently used for ErrP detection. In the proposed method, the EEG electrodes from the frontocentral region of the brain are ranked using standard deviation based ranking criterion and a few top-ranked electrodes will be considered for single-trial detection of ErrP. Then, a modified power-law based transformation is proposed to enhance the discriminability between the correct and error trials. The discriminability is enhanced by transforming the samples lying outside a predefined amplitude range according to power-law equation and the samples within the selected amplitude range are transformed linearly. The modified power-law transformation has two parameters K and.. The parameter K defines the pre-defined amplitude range and. is the power in the standard power-law equation. The proposed ErrP detection method is tested on a publicly available EEG database of 10 subjects. The proposed transformation increases the discriminability between the erroneous and correct trials and achieves the best trade-off between the sensitivity and the specificity for detecting ErrP on single-trial basis compared to existing methods. The average sensitivity and specificity achieved is 86.17 +/- 9.05% and 92.05 +/- 3.69% respectively. The higher sensitivity of detection erroneous trials can be used to faithfully correct the wrongly decoded signal in the EEG based BCI system.	[Parashiva, Praveen K.; Vinod, A.

This approach can benefit one individual, but be ineffective or even detrimental for another. Studying the efficacy of the large range of different parameters for different individuals is costly, time-consuming and requires a large sample size that makes such research impractical and hinders effective interventions. Here an active machine learning technique is presented across participants-personalized Bayesian optimization (pBO)-that searches available parameter combinations to optimize an intervention as a function of an individual's ability. This novel technique was utilized to identify transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) frequency and current strength combinations most likely to improve arithmetic performance, based on a subject's baseline arithmetic abilities. The pBO was performed across all subjects tested, building a model of subject performance, capable of recommending parameters for future subjects based on their baseline arithmetic ability. pBO successfully searches, learns, and recommends parameters for an effective neurointervention as supported by behavioral, stimulation, and neural data. The application of pBO in human-based research opens up new avenues for personalized and more effective interventions, as well as discoveries of protocols for treatment and translation to other clinical and non-clinical domains. Author summaryThe common one-size-fits-all approach used in biological and behavioral research has shown to be inefficient. This is especially the case in the field of brain stimulation, where many different combinations of stimulation parameters (i.e., frequency and current strength of the applied current) can be used for restorative or enhancement purposes, in clinical and non-clinical populations, respectively. Even intervention protocols that have reported to be effective for certain individuals can be detrimental for others. Here we present an active machine learning method, personalized Bayesian optimization (pBO) that successfully searches, learns, and recommends neurostimulation parameters across individuals. Based on an individual's baseline cognitive ability, the pBO identifies specific combinations of transcranial alternating current stimulation parameters, which are most likely to improve cognitive performance, in which case arithmetic problem solving. This timely approach provides a possible solution for the pressing need for personalization in different disciplines including medicine, psychology, and education.	[van Bueren, Nienke E.

J	Tian, WQ				Tian, Wenqiang			Personalized Emotion Recognition and Emotion Prediction System Based on Cloud Computing	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ASSOCIATION	Promoting economic development and improving people's quality of life have a lot to do with the continuous improvement of cloud computing technology and the rapid expansion of applications. Emotions play an important role in all aspects of human life. It is difficult to avoid the influence of inner emotions in people's behavior and deduction. This article mainly studies the personalized emotion recognition and emotion prediction system based on cloud computing. This paper proposes a method of intelligently identifying users' emotional states through the use of cloud computing. First, an emotional induction experiment is designed to induce the testers' positive, neutral, and negative three basic emotional states and collect cloud data and EEG under different emotional states. Then, the cloud data is processed and analyzed to extract emotional features. After that, this paper constructs a facial emotion prediction system based on cloud computing data model, which consists of face detection and facial emotion recognition. The system uses the SVM algorithm for face detection, uses the temporal feature algorithm for facial emotion analysis, and finally uses the classification method of machine learning to classify emotions, so as to realize the purpose of identifying the user's emotional state through cloud computing technology. Experimental data shows that the EEG signal emotion recognition method based on time domain features performs best has better generalization ability and is improved by 6.3% on the basis of traditional methods. The experimental results show that the personalized emotion recognition method based on cloud computing is more effective than traditional methods.

J	Masoumi, PM; Sadjedi, H				Masoumi, Parisa Moghri; Sadjedi, Hamed			Trial-Specific Feature Performance on Single-Channel Auditory Mismatch Negativity Detection	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Deviant response; feature extraction; genetic algorithm; mismatch negativity; neuro-sensory detection		Successful detection of uncommon events is vital in the survival of an organism. Specifically, the study of neuro-sensory detection lends itself widely to understanding the human brain. Mismatch Negativity (MMN) is an important Event-Related Potential (ERP) response to an oddball stimulus which is preceded by repeated homogeneous stimulation. MMN is associated with perceptual learning and medical diagnostics among other applications. Currently, MMN detection relies on visual inspection of ERPs by skilled clinicians which makes for a costly, slow and subjective tool. In this paper, we use MMN to quantify the discriminative abilities of healthy or diagnosed subjects. We introduce a novel algorithmic method to extract and select important trial-specific features for discriminating standard from deviant responses. We utilize machine learning and classification approaches to evaluate our novel model using single-subject trial data while minimizing the number of necessary selection features provided by statistical test parameters and Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this work, a large variety of methods with 27 subjects, hundreds of trials and electrode counts compete for the definitive discrimination of MMN events. Our model requires only one EEG channel, a single subject and as low as five deviant tones. The results show statistically significant detection improvement over the traditional methods while maximizing resource economy.

Neighborhood based decision theoretic rough set under dynamic granulation for BCI motor imagery classification	JOURNAL ON MULTIMODAL USER INTERFACES			English	Article						Chebyshev type 1 filter; Daubechies wavelet; Neighborhood rough set; Decision theoretic rough set; Dynamic granulation	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; WAVELETS; SIGNALS; REAL	Brain Computer Interface is an interesting and important research field that has contributed widespread application systems. In the medical field, it is important for physically challenged persons to aid in rehabilitation and restoration. In Brain Computer Interface, computer acts as interface between brain signals and external device. The computer processes the brain signals and sends necessary instructions to external device. The external device helps in restoring the movement ability of patient. Motor imagery is the imagination of motor movements like hand, foot and tongue. There is an associated brain signal when the normal person moves their hand, foot and tongue. Similarly, there is an associated brain signal when the physically challenged person imagines moving their hand, foot and tongue. When this brain signal is analyzed by brain computer interface, it can facilitate motor movements through external device. The aim of this work is to analyze and classify the brain signals for motor movements to aid in rehabilitation and restoration. In this paper BCI Competition IV Dataset I, Dataset IIa, BCI Competition III Dataset IIIa and Neuroprosthetic EEG Dataset are analyzed A novel optimization technique with Neighborhood Decision Theoretic Rough Set under Dynamic Granulation is proposed for motor imagery classification. Neighborhood based Decision Theoretic Rough Set under Dynamic Granulation (NDTRS under DG) is hybrid approach combining two algorithms Neighborhood Rough Set and Decision Theoretic Rough Set under Dynamic Granulation ((DTRS under DG). Neighborhood Rough Set overcomes the drawback of discretization step in Rough Set. Decision Theoretic Rough Set under Dynamic Granulation algorithm has loss function for classification. The effectiveness of classification is improved since the loss function is involved in the construction of algorithm. The proposed method Neighborhood based Decision Theoretic Rough Set under Dynamic Granulation gives higher classification accuracy compared to existing approaches.

However, it is unclear what psychophysiological is most reliable for real-time trust assessment during user's interaction with an autonomous system. This study investigates what psychophysiological signal is most suitable for assessing trust in real-time. A within-subject four condition experiment was implemented with a virtual reality autonomous vehicle driving game that involved 31 carefully selected participants, while electroencephalogram, electrodermal activity, eletrocardiogram, eye-tracking and facial electromyogram psychophysiological signals were acquired. We applied hybrid feature selection methods on the features extracted from the psychophysiological signals. Using training and testing datasets containing only the resulting features from the feature selection methods, for each individual and multi-modal (combined) psychophysiological signals, we trained and tested six stack ensemble trust classifier models. The results of the model's performance indicate that the EEG is most reliable, while the multimodal psychophysiological signals remain promising.

Devices such as blood-pressure monitors, glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyography (EMG) wearable devices allow health providers to collect the patient health information locally and make a real-time decision based on the Patient Health Data (PHD). Hospitals have been adopting the IoT for many years and now they have healthcare IoT devices in patients' rooms and their bodies. However, the medical agencies, hospitals, and companies do not consider the security risk of healthcare IoT devices connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). The IoT devices can be easily hacked and may lead to several potentially life-threatening risks due to poor authentication and encryption practices. Existing machine learning algorithms and blockchain approach working in the cloud computing environment are unable to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) like reliability, authentication, identification, and security requirements of healthcare IoT devices. Most of the traditional machine learning algorithms and techniques for healthcare IoT lacks the real-world implementation for secure data transmission. Therefore, blockchain is introduced for secure and reliable transaction in healthcare IoT. Whereas Fog Computing (FC) is introduced to extend the services of the cloud at the edge of networks. Integration of FC with blockchain can overcome the issue of healthcare IoT device identification, authentication, and verification for scalable frequent data transmission in a decentralized environment. Hence, a novel solution for the abovementioned problem is proposed using FC and blockchain. It includes an FC-based three-tier architecture, an analytical model, a mathematical framework, and an Advanced Signature-Based Encryption (ASE) algorithm for healthcare IoT device identification, verification, and Patient Health Data (PHD) authentication. The aim is to extend secure data transmission for healthcare IoT and end-users availing the real-time services. The proposed model and algorithm will be able to provide services for transaction and transmission near the edge in a secure manner. By analyzing the generated results from the proposed novel ASE algorithm for throughput, packet error, reliability, and malicious node detection accuracy; it is observed that the ASE algorithm in the FC environment easily outperforms the cloud and the other existing state of the art techniques such as FogBus, Femto cloud, Blockchain Fog-based Architecture Network (BFAN), and BeeKeeper. The malicious node detection accuracy of the ASE algorithm in the FC environment is 91% and in the cloud is 83%. Whereas the reliability percentage of the ASE algorithm in FC is 95% and in the cloud is 87%. The proposed approach is tested on simulators iFogSim (Net-Beans) and SimBlock. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Identifying Individuals Using EEG-Based Brain Connectivity Patterns	BRAIN INFORMATICS, BI 2021	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Brain Informatics (BI)	SEP 17-19, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			Electroencephalogram; Multivariate autoregressive; Vector autoregressive; Partial directed coherence; Coherence; Electrocardiogram	PERSON AUTHENTICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Considering the recent rapid advancements in digital technology, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is a potential candidate for a robust human biometric authentication system. In this paper the focus of investigation is the use of brain activity as a new modality for identification. Univariate model biometrics such as speech, heart sound and electrocardiogram (ECG) require high-resolution computer system with special devices. The heart sound is obtained by placing the digital stethoscope on the chest, the ECG signals at the hands or chest of the client and speaks into a microphone for speaker recognition. It is challenging task when adapting these technologies to human beings. This paper proposed a series of tasks in a single paradigm rather than having users perform several tasks one by one. The advantage of using brain electrical activity as suggested in this work is its uniqueness; the recorded brain response cannot be duplicated, and a person's identity is therefore unlikely to be forged or stolen. The disadvantage of applying univariate is that the process only includes correlation in time precedence of a signal, while the correlation between regions is ignored. The inter-regional could not be assessed directly from univariate models. The alternative to this problem is the generalization of univariate model to multivariate modeling, hypothesized that the inter-regional correlations could give additional information to discriminate between brain conditions where the models or methods can measure the synchronization between coupling regions and the coherency among them on brain biometrics. The key issue is to handle the single task paradigm proposed in this paper with multivariate signal EEG classification using Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) rather than univariate model. The brain biometric systems obtained a significant result of 95.33% for dynamic Vector autoregressive (VAR) time series and 94.59% for Partial Directed Coherence (PDC) and Coherence (COH) frequency domain features.

The severity of, and risks for patients associated with, seizures are largely linked to the duration of seizures. Methods that determine seizure duration based on seizure onsets could be used to help mitigate the risks associated with what might be extended seizures by guiding timely interventions. Methods Using long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings, this article presents a method for predicting whether a seizure is going to be long or short by analyzing the seizure onset. The definition of long and short depends on each patient's seizure distribution. By analyzing 2954 seizures from 10 patients, patient-specific classifiers were built to predict seizure duration given the first few seconds from the onset. Results The proposed methodology achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) performance of 0.7 for the 5 of 10 patients with above chance prediction performance (p value from 0.04 to 10(-9)). Conclusions Our results imply that the duration of seizures can be predicted from the onset in some patients. This could form the basis of methods for predicting status epilepticus or optimizing the amount of electrical stimulation delivered by seizure control devices.

While a multitude of studies have demonstrated the theoretic potential of BCI, a point of concern is that the studies are still confined to lab settings and mostly limited to healthy, able-bodied subjects. The CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race represents an opportunity to further develop BCI design strategies for use in real-time applications with a tetraplegic end user. In this study, as part of the preparation to participate in CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race, we investigate the design aspects of BCI in relation to the choice of its components, in particular, the type of calibration paradigm and its relevance for long-term use. The end goal was to develop a user-friendly and engaging interface suited for long-term use, especially for a spinal-cord injured (SCI) patient. We compared the efficacy of conventional open-loop calibration paradigms with real-time closed-loop paradigms, using pre-trained BCI decoders. Various indicators of performance were analyzed for this study, including the resulting classification performance, game completion time, brain activation maps, and also subjective feedback from the pilot. Our results show that the closed-loop calibration paradigms with real-time feedback is more engaging for the pilot. They also show an indication of achieving better online median classification performance as compared to conventional calibration paradigms (p = 0.0008). We also observe that stronger and more localized brain activation patterns are elicited in the closed-loop paradigm in which the experiment interface closely resembled the end application. Thus, based on this longitudinal evaluation of single-subject data, we demonstrate that BCI-based calibration paradigms with active user-engagement, such as with real-time feedback, could help in achieving better user acceptability and performance.

Representational dynamics preceding conscious access	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attentional selection; Conscious access; MVPA; Neural representations; Attentional blink; Lag-1 sparing; EEG		Our senses are continuously bombarded with more information than our brain can process up to the level of awareness. The present study aimed to enhance understanding on how attentional selection shapes conscious access under conditions of rapidly changing input. Using an attention task, EEG, and multivariate decoding of individual target- and distractor-defining features, we specifically examined dynamic changes in the representation of targets and distractors as a function of conscious access and the task-relevance (target or distractor) of the preceding item in the RSVP stream. At the behavioral level, replicating previous work and suggestive of a flexible gating mechanism, we found a significant impairment in conscious access to targets (T2) that were preceded by a target (T1) followed by one or two distractors (i.e., the attentional blink), but striking facilitation of conscious access to targets shown directly after another target (i.e., lag-1 sparing and blink reversal). At the neural level, conscious access to T2 was associated with enhanced early- and late-stage T1 representations and enhanced late-stage D1 representations, and interestingly, could be predicted based on the pattern of EEG activation well before T1 was presented. Yet, across task conditions, we did not find convincing evidence for the notion that conscious access is affected by rapid top-down selection-related modulations of the strength of early sensory representations induced by the preceding visual event. These results cannot easily be explained by existing accounts of how attentional selection shapes conscious access under rapidly changing input conditions, and have important implications for theories of the attentional blink and consciousness more generally.

Decoding Subjective Creativity Skill from Visuo-Spatial Reasoning Ability Using Capsule Graph Neural Network	2021 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUL 18-22, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc		creativity; visuo-spatial reasoning; EEG; capsule graph neural network		Scientific creativity refers to the development of new and innovative ideas that foster technological growth and advancement. This paper attempts to identify creative individuals in scientific domain by evaluating their visuo-spatial reasoning ability using EEG analysis system. The main objective of the present work is achieved by first procuring EEG signals from the scalp of subjects involved in a mental paper folding task. The acquired signals are pre-processed and transformed into a topological map using correlation analysis to investigate the connectivity patterns amongst different brain lobes pertaining to different degrees of spatial abilities (high and low). The acquired brain networks depict strong interconnections amongst bilateral supramarginal gyrus, right anterior prefrontal and right superior temporal lobes for subject possessing high spatial skills. Since, the correlation based brain network analysis provides a qualitative illustration of the connectivity patterns, centrality induced quantitative analysis have been performed. Such an evaluation has been conducted using two categories of centrality measures viz. degree centrality and betweenness centrality. The results obtained from centrality analysis also infer the active involvement of the aforesaid brain regions during mental paper folding activity. Finally, the centrality based network features are transferred to a novel Capsule Graph Neural Network (CapsGNN) based classifier to categorize the desired class labels. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superior functionality of the proposed network with respect to the conventional models. Moreover, statistical evaluation conducted also assures the supercilious performance of the proposed classifier. Thus, the present methodology can be utilized for recruiting creative individuals to different sectors of industries associated with innovation such as architecture, game designing and the like.

High transconductance, flexibility, and biocompatibility render OECTs ideal for detecting electrophysiological signals. Device properties such as transconductance, response time, and noise level should, however, be optimized to adapt to the needs of various application environments including in vitro cell culture, human skin, and inside of a living system. This review includes an overview of the origin of electrophysiological signals, the working principles of OECTs, and methods for performance optimization. While covering recent research examples of the use of OECTs in electrophysiology, a perspective is provided for next-generation bioelectric sensors and amplifiers for electrophysiology applications.

One established framework is the "Theory of Event Coding" (TEC). However, only rarely, this framework has been used in the context of response inhibition and how stimulus-response association or binding processes modulate response inhibition performance. Particularly the neural dynamics of stimulus-response representations during inhibitory control are elusive. To address this, we examined n = 40 healthy controls and combined temporal EEG signal decomposition with source localization and temporal generalization multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). We show that overlaps in features of stimuli used to trigger either response execution or inhibition compromised task performance. According to TEC, this indicates that binding processes in event file representations impact response inhibition through partial repetition costs. In the EEG data, reconfiguration of event files modulated processes in time windows well-known to reflect distinct response inhibition mechanisms. Crucially, event file coding processes were only evident in a specific fraction of neurophysiological activity associated with the inferior parietal cortex (BA40). Within that specific fraction of neurophysiological activity, the decoding of the dynamics of event file representations using temporal generalization MVPA suggested that event file representations are stable across several hundred milliseconds, and that event file coding during inhibitory control is reflected by a sustained activation pattern of neural dynamics. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The "mental representation" of how stimulus input translate into the appropriate response is central for goal-directed behavior. However, little is known about the dynamics of such representations on the neurophysiological level when it comes to the inhibition of motor processes. This dynamic is shown in the current study.

Accurate detection of HFOs is the key to pre-operative assessment for epilepsy. Due to the subjective bias caused by manual features and the class imbalance between HFOs and false HFOs, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory detection performance by the existing methods. To solve these problems, we put forward a novel method to accurately detect HFOs based on the stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and the ensemble classifier with sample weight adjusting factors. First, the adjustable threshold of Hilbert envelopes is proposed to isolate the events of interest (EoIs) from background activities. Then, the SDAE network is utilized to automatically extract features of EoIs in the time-frequency domain. Finally, the AdaBoost-based support vector machine ensemble classifier with sample weight adjusting factors is devised to separate HFOs from EoIs by using the extracted features. These adjusting factors are used to solve the class imbalance problem by adjusting sample weights when learning the base classifiers. Our HFO detection method is evaluated by using clinical iEEG data recorded from 20 patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The experimental results show that our detection method outperforms some existing methods in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate. In addition, the HFOs detected by our method are effective for localizing seizure onset zones.

J	Van Canneyt, J; Wouters, J; Francart, T				Van Canneyt, Jana; Wouters, Jan; Francart, Tom			Neural tracking of the fundamental frequency of the voice: The effect of voice characteristics	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						continuous speech; EEG; f0 tracking; natural speech decoding; pitch processing; voice characteristics	NATURAL SPEECH; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; RESPONSES; ENVELOPE; STIMULUS; PITCH; HARMONICS; VOWEL; EEG	Traditional electrophysiological methods to study temporal auditory processing of the fundamental frequency of the voice (f0) often use unnaturally repetitive stimuli. In this study, we investigated f0 processing of meaningful continuous speech. EEG responses evoked by stories in quiet were analysed with a novel method based on linear modelling that characterizes the neural tracking of the f0. We studied both the strength and the spatio-temporal properties of the f0-tracking response. Moreover, different samples of continuous speech (six stories by four speakers: two male and two female) were used to investigate the effect of voice characteristics on the f0 response. The results indicated that response strength is inversely related to f0 frequency and rate of f0 change throughout the story. As a result, the male-narrated stories in this study (low and steady f0) evoked stronger f0-tracking compared to female-narrated stories (high and variable f0), for which many responses were not significant. The spatio-temporal analysis revealed that f0-tracking response generators were not fixed in the brainstem but were voice-dependent as well. Voices with high and variable f0 evoked subcortically dominated responses with a latency between 7 and 12 ms. Voices with low and steady f0 evoked responses that are both subcortically (latency of 13-15 ms) and cortically (latency of 23-26 ms) generated, with the right primary auditory cortex as a likely cortical source. Finally, additional experiments revealed that response strength greatly improves for voices with strong higher harmonics, which is particularly useful to boost the small responses evoked by voices with high f0.

Linking stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep to the spectral EEG markers o the drives for sleep and wake	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG spectrum; factor analysis; principal component analysis; sleep-wake regulation; sleep staging	INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; GENETIC INFLUENCES; OPPONENT PROCESSES	The conventional staging classification reduces all patterns of sleep polysomnogram signals to a small number of yes-or-no variables labeled wake or a stage of sleep (e.g., W, N1, N2, N3, and R for wake, the first, second, and third stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep, respectively). However, the neurobiological underpinnings of such stages remained to be elucidated. We tried to evaluate their link to scores on the first and second principal components of the EEG spectrum (1PCS and 2PCS), the markers of two major groups of promoters/inhibitors of sleep/wakefulness delineated as the drives for sleep and wake, respectively. On two occasions, polysomnographic records were obtained from 69 university students during 50-min afternoon naps and 30-s stage epochs were assigned to 1PCS and 2PCS. Results suggested two dimensionality of the structure of individual differences in amounts of stages. Amount of N1 loaded exclusively on one of two dimensions associated with 1PCS, amounts of W and N2 loaded exclusively on another dimension associated with 2PCS, and amount of N3 was equally loaded on both dimensions. Scores demonstrated stability within each stage, but a drastic change in just one of two scores occurred during transitions from one stage to another on the way from wakefulness to deeper sleep (e.g., 2PCS changed from >0 to <0 during transition W -> N1, 1PCS changed from <0 to >0 during transition N1 -> N2). Therefore, the transitions between stages observed during short naps might be linked to rapid changes in the reciprocal interactions between the promoters/inhibitors of sleep/wakefulness. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the present nap study, two dimensionality of the structure of individual differences in sleep stages was revealed. These results also suggested that individual variation in the sleep and wake drives associated with the first and second principal components of the EEG spectrum might underlie this structure. It seemed that each stage might be related to a certain, stage-specific combination of wake-sleep promoting/inhibiting influences associated with these drives for sleep and wake.

Rajendra			Automated classification of remote sensing images using multileveled MobileNetV2 and DWT techniques	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						MobilNetV2; Multilevel feature generation; INCA; Remote sensing image classification	NEURAL-NETWORK; REPRESENTATION; SPACE; EEG	Automated classification of remote sensing images is one of the complex issues in robotics and machine learning fields. Many models have been proposed for remote sensing image classification (RSIC) to obtain high classification performance. The objective of this study are twofold. First, to create a new space object image collection as such a dataset is not currently available. Second, propose a novel RSIC model to yield highest classification performance using our newly created dataset. Our presented automated classification model consists of multilevel deep feature generation, iterative feature selection, and classification steps. The features are extracted from the images using pre-trained MobileNetV2 and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods. The combination of DWT and MobileNetV2 generates large number of features. Then, iterative neighborhood component analysis (INCA) is used to select the best features. Finally, selected features are fed to support vector machine (SVM) for automated classification. The presented model is validated using two RSIC datasets: UC-Merced, and newly created space object images (publicly available at: http://web.firat.edu.tr/turkertuncer/space_object.rar). The developed model has obtained an accuracy of 98.10% and 95.95% using UC-Merced, and newly generated space object image datasets, respectively with 10-fold cross-validation strategy. It can be concluded from the results that, the presented RSIC model is accurate and ready for real-world applications.

However, optimal feature extraction and classifiers have not yet been established. Furthermore, retraining still requires a large number of trials when new classes are added. The aim of this study is (i) to increase the classification performance for imagined speech and (ii) to apply a new class using a pretrained classifier with a small number of trials. We propose a novel framework based on deep metric learning that learns the distance by comparing the similarity between samples. We also applied the instantaneous frequency and spectral entropy used for speech signals to electroencephalography signals during imagined speech. The method was evaluated on two public datasets (6-class Coretto DB and 5-class BCI Competition DB). We achieved a 6-class accuracy of 45.00 +/- 3.13% and a 5-class accuracy of 48.10 +/- 3.68% using the proposed method, which significantly outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we verified that the new class could be detected through incremental learning with a small number of trials. As a result, the average accuracy is 44.50 +/- 0.26% for Coretto DB and 47.12 +/- 0.27% for BCI Competition DB, which shows similar accuracy to baseline accuracy without incremental learning. Our results have shown that the accuracy can be greatly improved even with a small number of trials by selecting appropriate features from imagined speech. The proposed framework could be directly used to help construct an extensible intuitive communication system based on brain-computer interfaces.

Methods: : We enrolled 81 patients with TSC who had undergone resective epilepsy surgery at Sanbo Brain Hospital, Capital Medical University, between April 2004 and June 2019. We estimated cumulative probability of remaining seizure-free and plotted survival curves. Variables were compared using Mann-Whitney U, Pearson's correlation, continuity correction, and Fisher's exact chi-square tests. Prognostic predictors were analysed using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests and Cox regression models. Results: : At the last follow-up, 48 (59.3%) patients were classified as International League Against Epilepsy Class 1 (including 14 patients who had seizures < 3 times postoperatively on the same or different day and were seizure-free at all other times). The estimated cumulative probability of remaining seizure-free postoperatively was 69.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58.8-79.2%), 61.9% (95% CI 51.1-72.7%), and 55.0% (95% CI 42.8-67.2%) at 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The mean time of remaining seizure-free was 7.24 +/- 0.634 years (95% CI 6.00-8.49); en bloc resection was an essential positive predictor of postoperative seizure freedom, as was age at seizure onset, regional interictal video-electroencephalography pattern, and temporal lobe surgery. The longer the seizure-free time, the less likely a relapse. Patients who postoperatively experienced seizures remained likely to recover. Conclusions: : We demonstrated the efficacy of surgical treatment for patients with TSC and intractable epilepsy. Detailed perioperative tests are a reliable predictor of postoperative seizure freedom.

J	Fan, Y; Han, QM; Guo, SM; Luo, H				Fan, Ying; Han, Qiming; Guo, Simeng; Luo, Huan			Distinct Neural Representations of Content and Ordinal Structure in Auditory Sequence Memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory working memory; hidden state; multivariate decoding; reactivations; sequence structure	WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-ORDER; TIME CELLS; HIPPOCAMPUS; INFORMATION; BRAIN; OBJECTS; OSCILLATIONS; MAINTENANCE	Two forms of information, frequency (content) and ordinal position (structure), have to be stored when retaining a sequence of auditory tones in working memory (WM). However, the neural representations and coding characteristics of content and structure, particularly during WM maintenance, remain elusive. Here, in two EEG studies in human participants (both sexes), by transiently perturbing the "activity-silent" WM retention state and decoding the reactivated WM information, we demon-strate that content and structure are stored in a dissociative manner with distinct characteristics throughout WM process. First, each tone in the sequence is associated with two codes in parallel, characterizing its frequency and ordinal position, respectively. Second, during retention, a structural retrocue successfully reactivates structure but not content, whereas a fol-lowing white noise triggers content but not structure. Third, structure representation remains stable, whereas content code undergoes a dynamic transformation through memory progress. Finally, the noise-triggered content reactivations during retention correlate with subsequent WM behavior. Overall, our results support distinct content and structure representations in auditory WM and provide an efficient approach to access the silently stored WM information in the human brain. The dis-sociation of content and structure could facilitate efficient memory formation via generalizing stable structure to new audi-tory contents.

Forecasting Seizure Storms Using Epilepsy Wristband Sensors	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material								Machine Learning From Wristband Sensor Data for Wearable, Noninvasive Seizure Forecasting Meisel C, El Atrache R, Jackson M, Schubach S, Ufongene C, Loddenkemper T. Epilepsia. 2020;61(12):2653-2666. doi: Objective: Seizure forecasting may provide patients with timely warnings to adapt their daily activities and help clinicians deliver more objective, personalized treatments. Although recent work has convincingly demonstrated that seizure risk assessment is in principle possible, these early approaches relied largely on complex, often invasive setups including intracranial electrocorticography, implanted devices, and multichannel electroencephalography and required patient-specific adaptation or learning to perform optimally, all of which limit translation to broad clinical application. To facilitate broader adaptation of seizure forecasting in clinical practice, noninvasive, easily applicable techniques that reliably assess seizure risk without much prior tuning are crucial. Wristbands that continuously record physiological parameters, including electrodermal activity, body temperature, blood volume pulse, and actigraphy, may afford monitoring of autonomous nervous system function and movement relevant for such a task, hence minimizing potential complications associated with invasive monitoring and avoiding stigma associated with bulky external monitoring devices on the head. Methods: Here, we applied deep learning on multimodal wristband sensor data from 69 patients with epilepsy (total duration >2311 hours, 452 seizures) to assess its capability to forecast seizures in a statistically significant way. Results: Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation approach, we identified better-than-chance predictability in 43% of the patients. Time-matched seizure surrogate data analyses indicated forecasting not to be driven simply by time of day or vigilance state. Prediction performance peaked when all sensor modalities were used and did not differ between generalized and focal seizure types but generally increased with the size of the training data set, indicating potential further improvement with larger data sets in the future. Significance: Collectively, these results show that statistically significant seizure risk assessments are feasible from easy-to-use, noninvasive wearable devices without the need of patient-specific training or parameter optimization.

The MI dataset consists of 3-class, namely 'Cylindrical', 'Spherical', and 'Lumbrical'. We utilized power spectral density as an emphasize method and a convolutional neural network to classify the modified MI data. The results showed that the MI-related frequency range was activated during the MI task, and provide neurophysiological evidence to design the proposed method. When using the proposed method, the average classification performance in the intra-session condition was 69.68% and the average classification performance in the inter-session condition was 52.76%. Our results provided the possibility of developing a BCI-based device control system for practical applications.

No muscle movements are required for this communication. The present study helps the disabled people (viz.patients with spinal cord injury, spastic cerebral palsy, locomotive diseases, etc.) ease their lives by accessing light, fan, mobile device, door, television, electric heater, etc. A novel 2 x 3 matrix consisting of home appliances visuals has been proposed as a P300 paradigm. Once the matrix visualization is completed, auditory feedback was provided and the chosen command was executed. It enables six menus to be navigated for hadling six electronic systems with up to 30 control commands. The objective of this research is to develop a P300-based BCI system for operating different electronic appliances at home. The existing BCI-based P300 spellers with standard machine learning methods suffers from low information transfer rate (ITR) and poor classification accuracy. With the application of convolution neural network (CNN) for classification, the proposed system improves the performance in terms of P300 classification & target appliances detection. The proposed system is designed to be user-convenient & cost-effective in terms of hardware design. The experiments have been performed on the dataset acquired from 30 target item selections from nine subjects using 16 channel actiCAP Xpress EEG recorders. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed CNN model achieved 90% classification accuracy. It also offers ITR of 22.3 bits per minute which is substantially greater than the existing methods. The presented approach shows its novelty in the real-time applications.

While the underlying mechanism is not fully understood, a `synaptic homeostasis' theory has been proposed that synapses continue to strengthen during awake and undergo downscaling during sleep. This theory predicts that brain excitability increases with sleepiness. Here, we collected transcranial magnetic stimulation measurements in 38 subjects in a 34 hr program and decoded the relationship between cortical excitability and self-report sleepiness using advanced statistical methods. By utilizing a combination of partial least squares regression and mixed-effect models, we identified a robust pattern of excitability changes, which can quantitatively predict the degree of sleepiness. Moreover, we found that synaptic strengthen occurred in both excitatory and inhibitory connections after sleep deprivation. In sum, our study provides supportive evidence for the synaptic homeostasis theory in human sleep and clarifies the process of synaptic strength modulation during sleepiness.

However, studying clinical (and often highly heterogeneous) cohorts introduces an added layer of complexity to such modeling procedures, potentially leading to instability of such techniques and, as a result, inconsistent findings. Here, we outline some key methodological considerations for applied research, referring to a hypothetical clinical experiment involving speech processing and worked examples of simulated electrophysiological (EEG) data. In particular, we focus on experimental design, data preprocessing, stimulus feature extraction, model design, model training and evaluation, and interpretation of model weights. Throughout the paper, we demonstrate the implementation of each step in MATLAB using the mTRF-Toolbox and discuss how to address issues that could arise in applied research. In doing so, we hope to provide better intuition on these more technical points and provide a resource for applied and clinical researchers investigating sensory and cognitive processing using ecologically rich stimuli.

Speaker separation in realistic noise environments with applications to a cognitively-controlled hearing aid	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Speaker separation; Noise suppression; Convolutional Neural Networks; Attention masking; Auditory attention decoding		Future wearable technology may provide for enhanced communication in noisy environments and for the ability to pick out a single talker of interest in a crowded room simply by the listener shifting their attentional focus. Such a system relies on two components, speaker separation and decoding the listener's attention to acoustic streams in the environment. To address the former, we present a system for joint speaker separation and noise suppression, referred to as the Binaural Enhancement via Attention Masking Network (BEAMNET). The BEAMNET system is an end-to-end neural network architecture based on self-attention. Binaural input waveforms are mapped to a joint embedding space via a learned encoder, and separate multiplicative masking mechanisms are included for noise suppression and speaker separation. Pairs of output binaural waveforms are then synthesized using learned decoders, each capturing a separated speaker while maintaining spatial cues. A key contribution of BEAMNET is that the architecture contains a separation path, an enhancement path, and an autoencoder path. This paper proposes a novel loss function which simultaneously trains these paths, so that disabling the masking mechanisms during inference causes BEAMNET to reconstruct the input speech signals. This allows dynamic control of the level of suppression applied by BEAMNET via a minimum gain level, which is not possible in other state-of-the-art approaches to end-to-end speaker separation. This paper also proposes a perceptually-motivated waveform distance measure. Using objective speech quality metrics, the proposed system is demonstrated to perform well at separating two equal-energy talkers, even in high levels of background noise. Subjective testing shows an improvement in speech intelligibility across a range of noise levels, for signals with artificially added head-related transfer functions and background noise. Finally, when used as part of an auditory attention decoder (AAD) system using existing electroencephalogram (EEG) data, BEAMNET is found to maintain the decoding accuracy achieved with ideal speaker separation, even in severe acoustic conditions. These results suggest that this enhancement system is highly effective at decoding auditory attention in realistic noise environments, and could possibly lead to improved speech perception in a cognitively controlled hearing aid.

A comprehensive understanding of pathogenic progression of the disease is required from the perspective of cortical metabolism; therefore, we aimed to characterize metabolic characteristics of extra-hypothalamic in HH patients. Methods: We investigated the metabolic characteristics of 16 HH patients, all of whom underwent epilepsy evaluation at Xuan Wu Hospital between 2017 and 2019. The lateralization and cortical distribution pattern of hypometabolism was assessed and related to HH mass neuroanatomy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as scalp-electroencephalogram (scalp-EEG) abnormalities. Furthermore, asymmetry measurements of region of interest (ROI) in the temporal cortex (hippocampal formation, amygdala, and lateral temporal neocortex) were quantitatively assessed based on the normalized average positron emission tomography (PET) voxel values. The surgery prognosis was assessed using the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification system. Results: The lateralization of hypometabolism in global visual ratings was consistent with the HH mass lateralization seen on MRI. Cortical hypometabolism showed three patterns depending whether the HH mass involved mammillary bodies, middle hypothalamus nucleus, or both. The three patterns were hypometabolism of the mesial temporal cortex with symptom of mesial temporal epilepsy (3/16, pattern I), lateral temporal, and extratemporal (frontal or parietal) cortex with symptom of neocortex temporal or frontal epilepsy (5/16, pattern II), and mesial and lateral temporal cortex and extratemporal (frontal or parietal) cortex with varied symptoms (8/16, pattern III), respectively. A significant difference in PET voxel values was found between bilateral hippocampal formation (P = 0.001) and lateral temporal neocortex in the third group (P = 0.005). We suggest that the hypometabolic characteristics of the extra-hypothalamic cortex in HH patients have three patterns. The final cortical hypometabolic pattern depends on the neuroanatomic location of the HH mass and was consistent with the main involved cortex of the interictal and ictal discharges. The third hypometabolic pattern with the most extensive cortical hypometabolism has a poorer prognosis.

Processing of such signals separately in the time-domain or in the frequency-domain does not provide sufficient information as their spectral properties change over time. Traditional methods such as the Fourier transform (FT) perform a transformation from time-domain to frequency-domain allowing a suitable spectral analysis but looses the spatial/temporal information of the signal components. Hence, it is not easy to observe a direct relationship between the time and frequency characteristics of the signal. This makes it difficult to extract useful information by using only time- or frequency-domain analysis for further processing purposes. To overcome this problem, joint time-frequency (TF) methods are developed and applied to the analysis and representation of non-stationary signals. In addition to revealing a time-dependent energy distribution information, TF methods have successfully been utilized in the estimation of some parameters related to the analyzed signals. In this paper, we briefly summarize the existing methods and present several state-of-the-art applications of TF methods in the classification of biomedical signals. We also point out some future perspectives for the processing of non-stationary signals in the joint TF domain. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

There are two main types of MI. Kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI) is proprioceptive (OR somato-) sensory imagination and Visual motor imagery (VMI) represents a visualization of the corresponding movement incorporating the visual network. Because these imagery tactics may use different networks, we hypothesized that the connectivity measures could characterize the two imageries better than the local activity. Electroencephalography data were recorded. Subjects performed different conditions, including motor execution (ME), KMI, VMI, and visual observation (VO). We tried to classify the KMI and VMI by conventional power analysis and by the connectivity measures. The mean accuracies of the classification of the KMI and VMI were 98.5% and 99.29% by connectivity measures (alpha and beta, respectively), which were higher than those by the normalized power (p<0.01, Wilcoxon paired rank test). Additionally, the connectivity patterns were correlated between the ME-KMI and between the VO-VMI. The degree centrality (DC) was significantly higher in the left-S1 at the alpha-band in the KMI than in the VMI. The MI could be well classified because the KMI recruits a similar network to the ME. These findings could contribute to MI training methods.

Understanding the pattern of preterm infants' noxious-evoked responses is vital to improve pain assessment in this group. This study investigated the discriminability and development of multimodal noxious-evoked responses in infants aged 28-40 weeks postmenstrual age. A classifier was trained to discriminate responses to a noxious heel lance from a nonnoxious control in 47 infants, using measures of facial expression, brain activity, heart rate, and limb withdrawal, and tested in two independent cohorts with a total of 97 infants. The model discriminates responses to the noxious from the nonnoxious procedure with an overall accuracy of 0.76-0.84 and an accuracy of 0.78-0.79 in the 28-31-week group. Noxious-evoked responses have distinct developmental patterns. Heart rate responses increase in magnitude with age, while noxious-evoked brain activity undergoes three distinct developmental stages, including a previously unreported transitory stage consisting of a negative event-related potential between 30 and 33 weeks postmenstrual age. These findings demonstrate that while noxious-evoked responses change across early development, infant responses to noxious and nonnoxious stimuli are discriminable in prematurity.

Regression analysis is a method that sorts those essential features/biomarkers that have a strong impact on the overall prediction. This study centres on delivering an individualized regression analysis of cognitively normal and MCI converts over the twenty independent biomarkers that leverage clinical data. Out of the 1713 male and female subjects, 768 female subjects were studied to investigate the prevalence of AD and MCI, those diagnosed with AD and MCI and their associated risk factors. The study data were gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Twenty potential clinical features were included; comprised of a combination of demographic, cerebral spinal fluid, cognitive, diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalography, genetic, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography testing variables. The regression analysis metrics R-squared, F-statistic, Omnibus, Durbin-Watson, Coefficient and Standard error, were used to evaluate the model. Our results showed that cognitive assessment metrics were highly significant among the other testing biomarkers. Additionally, we determined the significance of each clinical variable. Our performed analysis could impact the clinical setting as a means to further develop a machine learning model in predicting the conversion of MCI to AD or to detect principle subjects for clinical trials.

Accurate identification of eye states (open or closed) via an EEG-based BCI interface has many applications in a smart living environment, such as controlling devices and monitoring health status. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), including deep neural networks, are currently quite popular in many applications. In this study, a robust and unique ANN-based ensemble method is developed in which multiple ANNs are trained individually using different parts of the training data. The outcomes of each ANN are then combined using another ANN to enhance the predictive intelligence. The outcome of this ANN is considered the ultimate prediction of the user's eye state. The proposed ensemble method requires minimal training time and yields highly accurate eye state classification. An extensive analysis of bias and variance was used to assess the generalization ability of the proposed model while applying it to a real BCI environment and dataset. The proposed model outperforms traditional ANNs and other machine learning tools for eye state classification. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This development has the potential to transform sleep medicine in coming years to the betterment of patient care and our collective understanding of human sleep. This review addresses the current state of the field starting with a broad definition of the various components and analytic methods deployed in AI. We review examples of AI use in screening, endotyping, diagnosing, and treating sleep disorders and place this in the context of precision/personalized sleep medicine. We explore the opportunities for AI to both facilitate and extend providers' clinical impact and present ethical considerations regarding AI derived prognostic information.

J	Abbas, Q; Alsheddy, A				Abbas, Qaisar; Alsheddy, Abdullah			Driver Fatigue Detection Systems Using Multi-Sensors, Smartphone, and Cloud-Based Computing Platforms: A Comparative Analysis	SENSORS			English	Review						driver fatigue detection; multi-sensor; cloud computing; mobile sensor network; smartwatch; multimodal features learning; deep learning; convolutional neural network; recurrent neural network	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MOBILE HEALTH-CARE; MONITORING-SYSTEM; DROWSINESS DETECTION; RECOGNITION METHOD; DEEP; EYE; EEG; WIRELESS; INTELLIGENCE	Internet of things (IoT) cloud-based applications deliver advanced solutions for smart cities to decrease traffic accidents caused by driver fatigue while driving on the road. Environmental conditions or driver behavior can ultimately lead to serious roadside accidents. In recent years, the authors have developed many low-cost, computerized, driver fatigue detection systems (DFDs) to help drivers, by using multi-sensors, and mobile and cloud-based computing architecture. To promote safe driving, these are the most current emerging platforms that were introduced in the past. In this paper, we reviewed state-of-the-art approaches for predicting unsafe driving styles using three common IoT-based architectures. The novelty of this article is to show major differences among multi-sensors, smartphone-based, and cloud-based architectures in multimodal feature processing. We discussed all of the problems that machine learning techniques faced in recent years, particularly the deep learning (DL) model, to predict driver hypovigilance, especially in terms of these three IoT-based architectures. Moreover, we performed state-of-the-art comparisons by using driving simulators to incorporate multimodal features of the driver. We also mention online data sources in this article to test and train network architecture in the field of DFDs on public available multimodal datasets. These comparisons assist other authors to continue future research in this domain. To evaluate the performance, we mention the major problems in these three architectures to help researchers use the best IoT-based architecture for detecting DFDs in a real-time environment. Moreover, the important factors of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and 5th generation (5G) networks are analyzed in the context of deep learning architecture to improve the response time of DFD systems. Lastly, it is concluded that there is a research gap when it comes to implementing the DFD systems on MEC and 5G technologies by using multimodal features and DL architecture.

This study proposes a computation-aware (CA) Task Parallel Library (TPL) utilization procedure to parallelize the Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) algorithm on a multi-core CPU. The proposed CA method separates the complex from simple computations by exploring their execution times on a multi-core CPU. TPL is used for complex calculations, but not for simple ones. In comparison to the program without the TPL, the proposed CA procedure reduces the execution time of decomposing 8- and 32-channel artificially mixed signals by 34.88% and 43.01%, respectively. The proposed CA procedure reduces the execution time of decomposing 8- and 32-channel artificially mixed signals by 10.04% and 0.93%, respectively, compared to the fully parallelized program with TPL. Using CA TPL, the decomposition of 12-channel electroencephalograms (EEG) signals take 48.27% less time than without it. The proposed CA procedure reduces execution time by 15.12% compared to the fully parallelized program with TPL.

Among the BCI paradigms, motor imagery (MI)-based closed-loop BCI is still the main pattern in rehabilitation training. It can estimate a patient' motor intention and provide corresponding feedback. However, the individual difference in the ability to generate event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the low classification accuracy of the multi-class scenario restrict the application of MI-based BCI. In the current study, a novel online action observation (AO)-based BCI was proposed. The visual stimuli of four types of hand movements were designed to simultaneously induce steady-state motion visual evoked potential (SSMVEP) in the occipital region and to activate the sensorimotor region. Task-related component analysis was performed to identify the SSMVEP. Results showed that the amplitude of the induced frequency in the SSMVEP had a negative relationship with the stimulus frequency. The classification accuracy in the four-class scenario reached 72.81 +/- 13.55% within 2.5s. Importantly, the AO-based closed-loop BCI, which provided visual feedback based on the SSMVEP, could enhance ERD compared with AO-alone. The increased attentiveness might be one key factor for the enhancement of the ERD in the designed AO-based BCI. In summary, the proposed AO-based BCI provides a new insight for BCI-based rehabilitation.

J	Argiris, G; Rumiati, RI; Crepaldi, D				Argiris, Georgette; Rumiati, Raffaella, I; Crepaldi, Davide			No fruits without color: Cross-modal priming and EEG reveal different roles for different features across semantic categories	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPREADING ACTIVATION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; SURFACE DETAIL; NEURAL BASIS; BRAIN; KNOWLEDGE; SIMILARITY; PICTURES; REPRESENTATIONS; NEUROSCIENCE	Category-specific impairments witnessed in patients with semantic deficits have broadly dissociated into natural and artificial kinds. However, how the category of food (more specifically, fruits and vegetables) fits into this distinction has been difficult to interpret, given a pattern of deficit that has inconsistently mapped onto either kind, despite its intuitive membership to the natural domain. The present study explores the effects of a manipulation of a visual sensory (i.e., color) or functional (i.e., orientation) feature on the consequential semantic processing of fruits and vegetables (and tools, by comparison), first at the behavioral and then at the neural level. The categorization of natural (i.e., fruits/vegetables) and artificial (i.e., utensils) entities was investigated via cross-modal priming. Reaction time analysis indicated a reduction in priming for color-modified natural entities and orientation-modified artificial entities. Standard event-related potentials (ERP) analysis was performed, in addition to linear classification. For natural entities, a N400 effect at central channel sites was observed for the color-modified condition compared relative to normal and orientation conditions, with this difference confirmed by classification analysis. Conversely, there was no significant difference between conditions for the artificial category in either analysis. These findings provide strong evidence that color is an integral property to the categorization of fruits/vegetables, thus substantiating the claim that feature-based processing guides as a function of semantic category.

A number of recognition methods have been applied in recent years to recognize human emotion. The motivation for this study is therefore to discover a combination of emotion features and recognition method that will produce the best result in building an efficient emotion recognizer in an affective system. We introduced a shifted tanh normalization scheme to realize the inverse Fisher transformation applied to the DEAP physiological dataset and consequently performed series of experiments using the Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Networks (RBFANN). In our experiments, we have compared the performances of digital image based feature extraction techniques such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and the Histogram of Images (HIM). These feature extraction techniques were utilized to extract discriminatory features from the multimodal DEAP dataset of physiological signals. Experimental results obtained indicate that the best recognition accuracy was achieved with the EEG modality data using the HIM features extraction technique and classification done along the dominance emotion dimension. The result is very remarkable when compared with existing results in the literature including deep learning studies that have utilized the DEAP corpus and also applicable to diverse fields of engineering studies.

It is unknown how the success of BCI control by people with different personality traits is associated with interhemispheric asymmetry. Here we analyzed the relationships between personality traits and the accuracy of classification of brain signals in imagination of movements of the right hand (RH) and the left hand (LH) in comparison with the rest state with a single control of BCI by naive subjects. It is found that lively sensitive extraverts are more successful in imagining of RH movements, and practical, reserved, skeptical and not very sociable persons are more efficient in imagining of LH movements. BCI users open to change are more successful than traditionalists and conservatives in imagination of movements of both RH and LH. The analysis of subjective complexity of movement imagination shows that the classification accuracy during imagination of RH comparative to LH is higher in users for whom is more difficult to imagine the movements of RH, but not LH. The data obtained supposed to be connected with differences in motor control and dopamine level in the right and the left hemisphere.	[Reshetnikova, V. V.; Bobrova, E., V; Vershinina, E.

However, debate continues over the efficacy of neurofeedback, partly because existing evidence for efficacy is mixed and often non-specific, with unclear relationships between prognostic variables, patient performance when learning to self-regulate, and treatment outcomes. We report an extensive analysis on the understudied area of neurofeedback learning. Our data comes from a randomised controlled clinical trial in adults with ADHD (registered trial ISRCTN13915109; N = 23; 13:10 female:male; age 25-57). Patients were treated with either theta-beta ratio or sensorimotor-rhythm regimes for 40 one-hour sessions. We classify 11 learners vs 12 non-learners by the significance of random slopes in a linear mixed growth-curve model. We then analyse the predictors, outcomes, and processes of learners vs non-learners, using these groups as mutual controls. Significant predictive relationships were found in anxiety disorder (GAD), dissociative experience (DES), and behavioural inhibition (BIS) scores obtained during screening. Low DES, but high GAD and BIS, predicted positive learning. Patterns of behavioural outcomes from Test Of Variables of Attention, and symptoms from adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, suggested that learning itself is not required for positive outcomes. Finally, the learning process was analysed using structural-equations modelling with continuous-time data, estimating the short-term and sustained impact of each session on learning. A key finding is that our results support the conceptualisation of neurofeedback learning as skill acquisition, and not merely operant conditioning as originally proposed in the literature.

One specific class of theories, intrinsic clock theories, postulate that temporal information of a stimulus is represented much like other features such as color and location, bound together to form a coherent percept. Here, we explored to what extent this holds for temporal information after it has been perceived and is held in working memory for subsequent comparison. We recorded EEG of participants who were asked to time stimuli at lateral positions of the screen followed by comparison stimuli presented in the center. Using well-established markers of working memory maintenance, we investigated whether the usage of temporal information evoked neural signatures that were indicative of the location where the stimuli had been presented, both during maintenance and during comparison. Behavior and neural measures including the contralateral delay activity, lateralized alpha suppression, and decoding analyses through time all supported the same conclusion: The representation of location was strongly involved during perception of temporal information, but when temporal information was to be used for comparison, it no longer showed a relation to spatial information. These results support a model where the initial perception of a stimulus involves intrinsic computations, but that this information is subsequently translated to a stimulusindependent format to be used to further guide behavior.

Our algorithm first extracts three features, namely mean amplitude, line length, and local binary patterns that are fed to an ensemble of classifiers using hyperdimensional (HD) computing. These features are embedded into prototype vectors representing ictal (during seizures) and interictal (between seizures) brain states are constructed. These vectors can be computed at different spatial scales ranging from a single electrode up to many electrodes. This flexibility allows our algorithm to identify the electrodes that discriminate best between ictal and interictal brain states. We assess our algorithm on the SWEC-ETHZ iEEG dataset that includes 99 short-time iEEG seizures recorded with 36 to 100 electrodes from 16 drug-resistant epilepsy patients. Using $k$-fold cross-validation and all electrodes, our algorithm surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms yielding significantly shorter latency (8.81 s vs. 11.57 s) in seizure onset detection, and higher specificity (97.31% vs. 94.84%) and accuracy (96.85% vs. 95.42%). We can further reduce the latency of our algorithm to 3.74 s by allowing a slightly higher percentage of false alarms (2% specificity loss). Using only the top 10% of the electrodes ranked by our algorithm, we still maintain superior latency, sensitivity, and specificity compared to the other algorithms with all the electrodes. We finally demonstrate the suitability of our algorithm to deployment on low-cost embedded hardware platforms, thanks to its robustness to noise/artifacts affecting the signal, its low computational complexity, and the small memory-footprint on a RISC-V microcontroller.

We aim to use the proposed system to enhance the motor imagery (MI) modality. Since motor imagery requires a long time for training, a stimulation method with external stimuli through the sensory system is an alternative method for increasing efficiency. The research is divided into two parts. First, we observed the visual motion illusion pattern based on brain topographic maps for the novel BCI modality. Second, we implemented the illusory visual motion stimulus-based BCI system. Arrow and moving-arrow patterns were used to modulate alpha rhythms at the visual and motor cortex. The arrow pattern had an average classification accuracy of approximately 78.5%. Additionally, illusory visual motion stimulus-based BCI systems are proposed using the proposed feature extraction and decision-making algorithm. This proposed BCI system can control the cursor moving in the left or right direction with the designed algorithm to create five commands for assistive communication. Ten volunteers participated in the experiment, and a brain-computer interface system with motor imagery and an illusory visual motion stimulus were used to compare efficiencies. The results showed that the proposed method achieved approximately 4% higher accuracy than motor imagery. The accuracy of the proposed illusory visual motion stimulus and algorithm was approximately 80.3%. Therefore, an illusory visual motion stimulus hybrid BCI system can be incorporated into the MI-based BCI system for beginner motor imagery. Based on the results, the proposed assistive communication system can be used to enhance communication in people with severe disabilities.

This study proposes a detection model of the coupling strength between the cortex and muscles. The detection model uses an adaptive selector to choose the optimal long short-term memory network, uses this network to extract the features of electroencephalography and electromyography, and finally transforms time characteristics into the frequency domain. The transfer entropy is used to represent the interaction intensity of signals in different frequency bands. Using this model, we analyze the coupling relationship between the cortex and muscles in the three movements of wrist flexion, wrist extension, and clench fist, and compare the model with traditional wavelet coherence analysis and deep canonical correlation analysis. The experimental results show that our model can not only express the bidirectional coupling relationship between different frequency bands but also suppress the possible false coupling that traditional methods may detect. Our research shows that the proposed model has great potential in medical rehabilitation, movement decoding, and other fields.

J	Dumitrescu, C; Costea, IM; Semenescu, A				Dumitrescu, Catalin; Costea, Ilona-Madalina; Semenescu, Augustin			Using Brain-Computer Interface to Control a Virtual Drone Using Non-Invasive Motor Imagery and Machine Learning	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); EEG; BCI robotics; brain-to-vehicle; motor imagery (MI)	COMMUNICATION; BCI	In recent years, the control of devices "by the power of the mind" has become a very controversial topic but has also been very well researched in the field of state-of-the-art gadgets, such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and even smart TVs, and also in medicine, to be used by people with disabilities for whom these technologies may be the only way to communicate with the outside world. It is well known that BCI control is a skill and can be improved through practice and training. This paper aims to improve and diversify signal processing methods for the implementation of a brain-computer interface (BCI) based on neurological phenomena recorded during motor tasks using motor imagery (MI). The aim of the research is to extract, select and classify the characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are based on sensorimotor rhythms, for the implementation of BCI systems. This article investigates systems based on brain-computer interfaces, especially those that use the electroencephalogram as a method of acquisition of MI tasks. The purpose of this article is to allow users to manipulate quadcopter virtual structures (external, robotic objects) simply through brain activity, correlated with certain mental tasks using undecimal transformation (UWT) to reduce noise, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) together with determination coefficient (r(2)) and, for classification, a hybrid neural network consisting of Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and a multilayer perceptron-recurrent network (MLP-RNN), obtaining a classification accuracy of 95.5%. Following the tests performed, it can be stated that the use of biopotentials in human-computer interfaces is a viable method for applications in the field of BCI. The results presented show that BCI training can produce a rapid change in behavioral performance and cognitive properties. If more than one training session is used, the results may be beneficial for increasing poor cognitive performance. To achieve this goal, three steps were taken: understanding the functioning of BCI systems and the neurological phenomena involved; acquiring EEG signals based on sensorimotor rhythms recorded during MI tasks; applying and optimizing extraction methods, selecting and classifying characteristics using neuronal networks.

Therefore, there is a need to develop a new analgesic index with improved performance to quantify postoperative pain in conscious patients. Objective: This study aimed to develop a new analgesic index using photoplethysmogram (PPG) spectrograms and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to objectively assess pain in conscious patients. Methods: PPGs were obtained from a group of surgical patients for 6 minutes both in the absence (preoperatively) and in the presence (postoperatively) of pain. Then, the PPG data of the latter 5 minutes were used for analysis. Based on the PPGs and a CNN, we developed a spectrogram-CNN index for pain assessment. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was measured to evaluate the performance of the 2 indices. Results: PPGs from 100 patients were used to develop the spectrogram-CNN index. When there was pain, the mean (95% CI) spectrogram-CNN index value increased significantly-baseline: 28.5 (24.2-30.7) versus recovery area: 65.7 (60.5-68.3); P<.01. The AUC and balanced accuracy were 0.76 and 71.4%, respectively. The spectrogram-CNN index cutoff value for detecting pain was 48, with a sensitivity of 68.3% and specificity of 73.8%. Conclusions: Although there were limitations to the study design, we confirmed that the spectrogram-CNN index can efficiently detect postoperative pain in conscious patients. Further studies are required to assess the spectrogram-CNN index's feasibility and prevent overfitting to various populations, including patients under general anesthesia.

J	de Cheveigne, A; Slaney, M; Fuglsang, SA; Hjortkjaer, J				de Cheveigne, Alain; Slaney, Malcolm; Fuglsang, Soren A.; Hjortkjaer, Jens			Auditory stimulus-response modeling with a match-mismatch task	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; MEG; BCI; auditory; decoding; CCA; attention decoding		Objective. An auditory stimulus can be related to the brain response that it evokes by a stimulus-response model fit to the data. This offers insight into perceptual processes within the brain and is also of potential use for devices such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). The quality of the model can be quantified by measuring the fit with a regression problem, or by applying it to a classification task and measuring its performance. Approach. Here we focus on a match-mismatch (MM) task that entails deciding whether a segment of brain signal matches, via a model, the auditory stimulus that evoked it. Main results. Using these metrics, we describe a range of models of increasing complexity that we compare to methods in the literature, showing state-of-the-art performance. We document in detail one particular implementation, calibrated on a publicly-available database, that can serve as a robust reference to evaluate future developments. Significance. The MM task allows stimulus-response models to be evaluated in the limit of very high model accuracy, making it an attractive alternative to the more commonly used task of auditory attention detection. The MM task does not require class labels, so it is immune to mislabeling, and it is applicable to data recorded in listening scenarios with only one sound source, thus it is cheap to obtain large quantities of training and testing data. Performance metrics from this task, associated with regression accuracy, provide complementary insights into the relation between stimulus and response, as well as information about discriminatory power directly applicable to BCI applications.

Based on the meta heuristic algorithm, the Filter and Wrapper algorithms were combined in this study to form a new feature selection algorithm FAW-FS. Then, the classification accuracy of FAW-FS and the ability to identify depression disorders were verified under different open data sets. 54 patients with AGA who went to the Medical Cosmetic Center of Tongji Hospital were selected as the research objects and rolled into a control group (routine psychological intervention) and an intervention group (routine + comprehensive psychological interventions) according to different psychological intervention methods, with 27 cases in each group. The differences of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), and physical, psychological, social, and substance function scores before and after intervention were compared between the two groups of AGA patients, and the depression efficacy and compliance of the two groups were analyzed after intervention. The results showed that the classification accuracy of FAW-FS algorithm was the highest in logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, and random forest (RF) algorithm, which was 80.87, 79.24, 80.42, 83.07, and 81.45%, respectively. The LR algorithm had the highest feature selection accuracy of 82.94%, and the classification accuracy of depression disorder in RF algorithm was up to 73.01%. Besides, the SDS, SAS, and HAMD scores of the intervention group were lower sharply than the scores of the control group (p < 0.05). The physical function, psychological function, social function, and substance function scores of the intervention group were higher markedly than those of the control group (p < 0.05). In addition, the proportions of cured, markedly effective, total effective, full compliance, and total compliance patients in the intervention group increased obviously in contrast to the proportions of the control group (p < 0.05). Therefore, it indicated that the FAW-FS algorithm established in this study had significant advantages in the recognition of depression in AGA patients, and comprehensive psychological intervention had a positive effect in the rehabilitation of depression in AGA patients.

Accurately detected HFOs are used to localize SOZs, which is crucial for the presurgical assessment. Since the visual marking of HFOs is time-consuming, a method is desirable to automatically detect HFOs for localizing SOZs in clinical practice. However, the existing methods cannot obtain satisfactory performance, which are not suitable for clinical application. In order to solve this problem, we present a new localization method for epileptic SOZs in this study. Firstly, a threshold method is used to detect events of interest (EoIs). Secondly, a time-frequency analysis method is adopted to acquire channels of interest (CoIs) by calculating the average power of EoIs on each channel. Then, the k-medoids clustering method is employed to detect HFOs of CoIs. Finally, the concentrations of detected HFOs are used to localize SOZs. The superiority of our localization method is demonstrated by comparing its sensitivity and specificity with some existing methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Familial recurrence is acknowledged for some sleep disorders, but definite data are lacking for many of them. Genetic studies on sleep disorders have progressed from twin and family studies to candidate gene approaches to culminate in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Several works disclosed that sleep-wake characteristics, in addition to electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, have a certain degree of heritability. Notwithstanding, it is rare for sleep disorders to be attributed to single gene defects because of the complexity of the brain network/pathways involved. Besides, the advancing insights in epigenetic gene-environment interactions add further complexity to understanding the genetic control of sleep and its disorders. This narrative review explores the current genetic knowledge in sleep disorders in children, following the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-Third Edition (ICSD-3) categorisation.</p>	[Mainieri, Greta; Montini, Angelica; Provini, Federica] Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, I-40138 Bologna, Italy; [Nicotera, Antonio; Di Rosa, Gabriella] Gaetano Barresi Univ Messina, Dept Human Pathol Adult & Dev Age, Unit Child Neurol & Psychiat, I-98124 Messina, Italy; [Provini, Federica] IRCCS Ist Sci Neurol Bologna, I-40139 Bologna, Italy; [Loddo, Giuseppe] Azienda USL Bologna, I-40124 Bologna, Italy		Provini, F (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Biomed & Neuromotor Sci, I-40138 Bologna, Italy.; Provini, F (corresponding author), IRCCS Ist Sci Neurol Bologna, I-40139 Bologna, Italy.	greta.mainieri2@unibo.it; angelica.montini@studio.unibo.it; antonionicotera@ymail.com; gabriella.dirosa@unime.it; federica.provini@unibo.it; loddogiuseppe0@gmail.com	Mainieri, Greta/AAD-1522-2021	Loddo, Giuseppe/0000-0001-8748-5984; Mainieri, Greta/0000-0002-6159-854X					200	0	0	3	6	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2076-3425		BRAIN SCI	Brain Sci.

Insomnia is a sleep disorder in which an individual complaint of difficulties in starting/continuing sleep at least four weeks regularly. It is estimated that 70% of heart diseases are generated during insomnia sleep disorder. The main objective of this study is to determine all work conducted on insomnia detection and to make a database. We used two procedures including network visualization techniques on two databases including PubMed and Web of Science to complete this study. We found 169 and 36 previous publications of insomnia detection in the PubMed and the Web of Science databases, respectively. We analyzed 10 datasets, 2 databases, 21 genes, and 23 publications with 30105 subjects of insomnia detection. This work has revealed the future way and gap so far directed on insomnia detection and has also tried to provide objectives for the future work to be proficient in a scientific and significant manner.

Seizure Forecasting: Patient and Caregiver Perspectives	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						seizure forecasting; community survey; patient perception; wearable sensors; epilepsy; seizure forecasting devices	AUTOMATED SEIZURE; EPILEPSY; PREDICTION	Accurate seizure forecasting is emerging as a near-term possibility due to recent advancements in machine learning and EEG technology improvements. Large-scale data curation and new data element collection through consumer wearables and digital health tools such as longitudinal seizure diary data has uncovered new possibilities for personalized algorithm development that may be used to predict the likelihood of future seizures. The Epilepsy Foundation recognized the unmet need for development in seizure forecasting following a 2016 survey where an overwhelming majority of respondents across all seizure types and frequencies reported that unpredictability of seizures had the strongest impact on their life while living with or caring for someone living with epilepsy. In early 2021, the Epilepsy Foundation conducted an updated survey among those living with epilepsies and/or their caregivers to better understand the use-cases that best suit the needs of our community as seizure forecast research advances. These results will provide researchers with insight into user-acceptance of using a forecasting tool and incorporation into their daily life. Ultimately, this input from people living with epilepsy and caregivers will provide timely feedback on what the community needs are and ensure researchers and companies first and foremost consider these needs in seizure forecasting tools/product development.

In order to be effective in soccer, unpredictable, sudden and at the same time creative (i.e. unique, original and effective) ideas are required in situations with high time pressure. Accordingly, creative task performance in soccer should be primarily driven by rapid and automatic cognitive processes. This study investigated if functional patterns of brain activation during the observation/encoding of real soccer game situations can predict creative soccer task performance. A machine learning approach (multivariate pattern recognition) was applied in a sample of 35 experienced male soccer players. The results revealed that brain activation during the observation of the soccer scenes significantly predicted creative soccer task performance, while brain activation during the subsequent ideation/elaboration period did not. The identified brain network included areas such as the angular gyrus, the supramarginal gyrus, the occipital cortex, parts of the cerebellum and (left) supplementary motor areas, which are important for semantic information processing, memory retrieval, integration of sensory information and motor control. This finding suggests that early and presumably automatized neurocognitive processes, such as (implicit) knowledge about motor movements, and the rapid integration of information from different sources are important for creative task performance in soccer.

Mismatched response predicts behavioral speech discrimination outcomes in infants with hearing loss and normal hearing	INFANCY			English	Article								Children with hearing loss (HL) remain at risk for poorer language abilities than normal hearing (NH) children despite targeted interventions; reasons for these differences remain unclear. In NH children, research suggests speech discrimination is related to language outcomes, yet we know little about it in children with HL under the age of 2 years. We utilized a vowel contrast, /a-i/, and a consonant-vowel contrast, /ba-da/, to examine speech discrimination in 47 NH infants and 40 infants with HL. At Mean age =3 months, EEG recorded from 11 scalp electrodes was used to compute the time-frequency mismatched response (TF-MMRSE) to the contrasts; at Mean age =9 months, behavioral discrimination was assessed using a head turn task. A machine learning (ML) classifier was used to predict behavioral discrimination when given an arbitrary TF-MMRSE as input, achieving accuracies of 73% for exact classification and 92% for classification within a distance of one class. Linear fits revealed a robust relationship regardless of hearing status or speech contrast. TF-MMRSE responses in the delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (3.5-8 Hz), and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands explained the most variance in behavioral task performance. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using TF-MMRSE to predict later behavioral speech discrimination.

Glial Modulation of Electrical Rhythms in a Neuroglial Network Model of Epilepsy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Picture archiving and communication systems; Clocks; Biological system modeling; Hidden Markov models; Epilepsy; Brain modeling; Mathematical model; Phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling; cognitive rhythm generator; neuroglial network; epilepsy; postictal generalized EEG suppression; state classification; hidden markov model	OSCILLATIONS; MICROGLIA; DYNAMICS; PHASE; INSIGHTS; SIGNALS; ROLES; SLEEP	Objective: An important EEG-based biomarker for epilepsy is the phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (PAC) of electrical rhythms; however, the underlying pathways of these pathologic markers are not always clear. Since glial cells have been shown to play an active role in neuroglial networks, it is likely that some of these PAC markers are modulated via glial effects. Methods: We developed a 4-unit hybrid model of a neuroglial network, consisting of 16 sub-units, that combines a mechanistic representation of neurons with an oscillator-based Cognitive Rhythm Generator (CRG) representation of glial cells-astrocytes and microglia. The model output was compared with recorded generalized tonic-clonic patient data, both in terms of PAC features, and state classification using an unsupervised hidden Markov model (HMM). Results: The neuroglial model output showed PAC features similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. These generated PAC features were able to accurately identify spontaneous epileptiform discharges (SEDs) as seizure-like states, as well as a postictal-like state following the long-duration SED, when applied to the HMM machine learning algorithm trained on patient data. The evolution profile of the maximal PAC during the SED compared well with patient data, showing similar association with the duration of the postictal state. Conclusion: The hybrid neuroglial network model was able to generate PAC features similar to those observed in ictal and postictal epileptic states, which has been used for state classification and postictal state duration prediction. Significance: Since PAC biomarkers are important for epilepsy research and postictal state duration has been linked with risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, this model suggests glial synaptic effects as potential targets for further analysis and treatment.

Therefore, the identification of early strategies to assess and rehabilitate these impairments appears to be a priority. The ecological limitations of traditional neuropsychological tests and the numerous difficulties in administering tests in real-life scenarios have led to the increasing use of virtual reality (VR) and 360 degrees environment-based tools for assessing executive functions (EFs) in real life. This perspective aims at proposing the development and implementation of Executive-functions Innovative Tool 360 degrees (EXIT 360 degrees), an innovative, enjoyable, and ecologically valid tool for a multidimensional and multicomponent evaluation of executive dysfunctions. EXIT 360 degrees allows a complete and integrated executive functioning assessment through an original task for EFs delivered via a mobile-powered VR headset combined with eye tracker (ET) and electroencephalograms (EEG). Our tool is born as a 360 degrees-based instrument, easily accessible and clinically usable, that will radically transform clinicians' and patient's assessment experience. In EXIT 360 degrees, patients are engaged in a "game for health," where they must perform everyday subtasks in 360 degrees daily life environments. In this way, the clinicians can obtain quickly more ecologically valid information about several aspects of EFs (e.g., planning, problem-solving). Moreover, the multimodal approach allows completing the assessment of EFs by integrating verbal responses, reaction times, and physiological data (eye movements and brain activation). Overall, EXIT 360 degrees will allow obtaining simultaneously and in real time more information about executive dysfunction and its impact in real life, allowing clinicians to tailor the rehabilitation to the subject's needs.

Attentive brain states in infants with and without later autism	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SOCIAL ATTENTION; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; ENDOPHENOTYPE CONCEPT; EYE GAZE; FACE; ASD; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN	Early difficulties in engaging attentive brain states in social settings could affect learning and have cascading effects on social development. We investigated this possibility using multichannel electroencephalography during a face/non-face paradigm in 8-month-old infants with (FH, n = 91) and without (noFH, n = 40) a family history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An event-related potential component reflecting attention engagement, the Nc, was compared between FH infants who received a diagnosis of ASD at 3 years of age (FH-ASD; n = 19), FH infants who did not (FH-noASD; n = 72) and noFH infants (who also did not, hereafter noFH-noASD; n = 40). 'Prototypical' microstates during social attention were extracted from the noFH-noASD group and examined in relation to later categorical and dimensional outcome. Machine-learning was used to identify the microstate features that best predicted ASD and social adaptive skills at three years. Results suggested that whilst measures of brain state timing were related to categorical ASD outcome, brain state strength was related to dimensional measures of social functioning. Specifically, the FH-ASD group showed shorter Nc latency relative to other groups, and duration of the attentive microstate responses to faces was informative for categorical outcome prediction. Reduced Nc amplitude difference between faces with direct gaze and a non-social control stimulus and strength of the attentive microstate to faces contributed to the prediction of dimensional variation in social skills. Taken together, this provides consistent evidence that atypical attention engagement precedes the emergence of difficulties in socialization and indicates that using the spatio-temporal characteristics of whole-brain activation to define brain states in infancy provides an important new approach to understanding of the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that lead to ASD.

One of its type is Arrhythmia in which normal rhythm of heart is varied due to damage in heart muscles and electrolyte imbalance. To study cardiovascular disease, Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is used that plays a significant role in identifying Arrhythmia. By using a combination of Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a hybrid technique is proposed in this research work to detect and classify Arrhythmia. MEMD, a promising technique that is used nowadays for denoising of multichannel signals, is used in this work. Two main features, i.e., RR interval and Heart Rate are extracted from the ECG signal for the detection of Arrhythmia. Using these features, Arrhythmia is classified into Tachycardia and Bradycardia. Classification is done using pattern recognition of ANN in which Multilayer feed forward neural network is used and trained through Back Propagation Algorithm. Results that are achieved using proposed technique is compared with previous existing techniques as in 2016 (Discrete Wavelet Transform) DWT and ANN gave 87.01% and in 2018 (Empirical Mode Decomposition) EMD and (Linear Discriminant Analysis) LDA gave 87% accuracy. As compare to these techniques, the proposed technique results show that it is an efficient technique that gives better accuracy of 89.8%.

Central nervous activity during implicit processing of emotional face expressions in fibromyalgia syndrome	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Fibromyalgia; Chronic pain; Emotional processing; Attention; Facial expression; EEG		Objective: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is characterized by chronic widespread pain accompanied by symptoms like fatigue, insomnia, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairments. In addition to central nervous pain sensitization, emotional dysregulation may be involved in FMS pathogenesis. This study investigated central nervous correlates of affective and attentional processing in FMS using an implicit task. Methods: Event-related potentials (ERPs) of the EEG were recorded in 25 FMS patients and 37 healthy controls while they had to name the frame color of pictures displaying emotional expressions (angry, painful, happy, neutral). The actual picture had to be ingored. Symptoms of pain, depression and anxiety were also assessed. Results: Patients exhibited smaller P2 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes, and a greater N250 amplitude, than controls. The N250 amplitude varied according to the emotional expressions displayed in patients, but not in controls. No group differences arose for the P1 or N170 amplitudes. Patients had longer reaction times and made more errors on the task; task performance was more closely related to pain severity than to other symptoms. Conclusion: The reduced P2 and LPP amplitudes indicate deficient short-term mobilization of attentional resources and sustained attention in FMS; the greater N250 amplitude may reflect greater engagement in the decoding of complex facial features, which is necessary to compensate for attentional impairments. Affective modulation of the N250 suggests that the neural mechanisms underlying complex visual processes are particularly susceptible to emotional influences in FMS. The behavioral data confirm attentional deficits in the disorder and implicate clinical pain therein.	[Fischer-Jbali, L.

Decoding the Confidence Level of Subjects in Answering Multiple Choice Questions Using EEG Induced Capsule Network	2021 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI 2021)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	DEC 05-07, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc		multiple choice test; confidence; EEG; spectrogram; capsule network	TESTS; TOOL	The paper introduces an innovative methodology for the automatic discrimination of multiple choice answers chosen by merit and random guess by analyzing the confidence level of examinees using an Electroencephalographic system. The acquired brain signals of the subjects participating in the experiment are first examined using the eLORETA software which portrays the active participation of the middle frontal gyrus and precuneus when a subject is fully confident regarding the choice of the correct answer. In the next phase, the signals are pre-processed and converted to spectrogram plots using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) which reveal the enhanced activation of theta and lower alpha bands when a subject attempts an answer with his/her merit. On the other hand, the afore-said frequency bands portray reduced activation when a subject tries to choose an answer by a mere guess. The acquired spectrogram plots are transferred to a novel Capsule network model that aids in categorizing the two degrees of confidence level: High and Low. The novelty in the design of the Capsule based classifier lies in the introduction of a depthwise separable convolution layer, a squeeze and excitation attention mechanism and a Sigmoid-Weighted Linear Unit (SiLU) based dynamic routing algorithm. The proposed classifier demonstrates promising results in categorizing the two classes of confidence level and also outperforms its conventional counterparts. Thus, the proposed scheme can be utilized to improve the quality of assessment in multiple choice based examinations.

Although valid retrospective cues often facilitate memory recall, invalid ones may or may not result in performance costs. We investigated individual differences in utilising retrospective cues and evaluated how these individual differences are associated with brain oscillatory activity at rest. At the behavioural level, we operationalised flexibility as the ability to make effective use of retrospective cues or disregard them if required. At the neural level, we tested whether individual differences in such flexibility were associated with properties of resting-state alpha oscillatory activity (8-12 Hz). To capture distinct aspects of these brain oscillations, we evaluated their power spectral density and temporal dynamics using long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). In addition, we performed multivariate patterns analysis (MVPA) to classify individuals' level of behavioural flexibility based on these neural measures. We observed that alpha power alone (magnitude) at rest was not associated with flexibility. However, we found that the participants' ability to manipulate VWM representations was correlated with alpha LRTC and could be decoded using MVPA on patterns of alpha power. Our findings suggest that alpha LRTC and multivariate patterns of alpha power at rest may underlie some of the individual differences in using retrospective cues in working memory tasks.

J	Sutterer, DW; Polyn, SM; Woodman, GF				Sutterer, David W.; Polyn, Sean M.; Woodman, Geoffrey F.			alpha-Band activity tracks a two-dimensional spotlight of attention during spatial working memory maintenance	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha; attention; EEG; visual working memory	VISUAL-ATTENTION; REPRESENTATIONS; TOPOGRAPHY; PARIETAL; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; FIELD	Covert spatial attention is thought to facilitate the maintenance of locations in working memory, and EEG alpha-band activity (8-12Hz) is proposed to track the focus of covert attention. Recent work has shown that multivariate patterns of alpha-band activity track the polar angle of remembered locations relative to fixation. However, a defining feature of covert spatial attention is that it facilitates processing in a specific region of the visual field, and prior work has not determined whether patterns of alpha-band activity track the two-dimensional (2-D) coordinates of remembered stimuli within a visual hemifield or are instead maximally sensitive to the polar angle of remembered locations around fixation. Here, we used a lateralized spatial estimation task, in which observers remembered the location of one or two target dots presented to one side of fixation, to test this question. By applying a linear discriminant classifier to the topography of alpha-band activity, we found that we were able to decode the location of remembered stimuli. Critically, model comparison revealed that the pattern of classifier choices observed across remembered positions was best explained by a model assuming that alpha-band activity tracks the 2-D coordinates of remembered locations rather than a model assuming that alpha-band activity tracks the polar angle of remembered locations relative to fixation. These results support the hypothesis that this alpha-band activity is involved in the spotlight of attention, and arises from mid- to lower-level visual areas involved in maintaining spatial locations in working memory. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A substantial body of work has shown that patterns of EEG alpha-band activity track the angular coordinates of attended and remembered stimuli around fixation, but whether these patterns track the two-dimensional coordinates of stimuli presented within a visual hemifield remains an open question. Here, we demonstrate that alpha-band activity tracks the two-dimensional coordinates of remembered stimuli within a hemifield, showing that alpha-band activity reflects a spotlight of attention focused on locations maintained in working memory.

In small dataset particularly those that rely mainly on subject-specific analyses, these decoding techniques correspond too closely to set of data and may consequently unable to generalize well on future observations. Considering this overfitting issue, expanding the datasets without introducing extra noise or losing important information is highly demanded. In so doing, this work invokes a novel idea of using delay-embedding-based nonlinear principal component analysis (DE-NLPCA) to generate synthetic time series. This idea was inspired by extracting topological representation of input space by unsupervised learning which can benefits augmentation of biomedical time series, tending to be high dimensional and morphologically complex. Different types of time series with different temporal complexity were used for evaluation. One of them was an open dataset associated with the activities of daily living, being collected from 10 healthy participants performing 186 ADL-related instances of activity while wearing 9-axis Inertial Measurement Units. Another dataset was an experimental data from healthy-brain patients undergoing operation (N = 20), being recorded from the BrainStatus device with 10 EEG channels. Considering leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, increase of up to 14.72% in classification performance (in terms of accuracy) was observed across anesthesia dataset when DE-NLPCA-based augmented data was introduced during training. It was also found that classification performance was more improved when DE-NLPCA-based technique were introduced compared to augmentation using conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). This DE-NLPCA-based approach was also shown to be able to recover time-frequency characteristics of contaminated signals.

However, physiological biosignals often vary across users and recording sessions due to unstable physical/mental conditions and task-irrelevant activities. To deal with this challenge, we propose a method of adversarial feature encoding with the concept of a Rateless Autoencoder (RAE), in order to exploit disentangled, nuisance-robust, and universal representations. We achieve a good trade-off between user-specific and task-relevant features by making use of the stochastic disentanglement of the latent representations by adopting additional adversarial networks. The proposed model is applicable to a wider range of unknown users and tasks as well as different classifiers. Results on cross-subject transfer evaluations show the advantages of the proposed framework, with up to an 11.6% improvement in the average subject-transfer classification accuracy.

Cognitive theories assume that the activation/deactivation of goals and task rules is central to understand cognitive flexibility. However, how this activation/deactivation dynamic is implemented on a neurophysiological level is unclear. Using EEG-based multivariate pattern analysis (I=PA) methods, we show that activation of relevant information occurs parallel in time at multiple levels in the neurophysiological signal containing aspects of stimulus-related processing, response selection, and motor response execution, and relates to different brain regions. The intensity with which task sets are activated and processed dynamically decreases and increases. The temporal stability of these activations could, however, hardly explain behavioral performance. Instead, task set deactivation processes associated with left orbitofrontal regions and inferior parietal regions selectively acting on motor response task sets are relevant. The study shows how propositions from cognitive theories stressing the importance task set activation/deactivation during cognitive flexibility are implemented on a neurophysiological level.

Since leg muscle reaction in the form of Electromyogram (EMG) signals and stride interval time series (as gait variability) have complex structures, we utilized fractal theory and sample entropy to decode their alterations at different walking speeds. Twenty-two subjects walked at three different speeds (slow, comfortable, and fast) in six trials, and we analyzed the fractal dimension and sample entropy of EMG signals and stride interval time series. Based on the results, increasing the walking speed causes lower complexity in EMG signals and stride interval time series. Besides, strong correlations were found among the changes in the complexity of EMG signals and stride interval time series at different walking speeds. This method can be applied to analyze the correlation between other complex physiological signals of humans (e.g., EEG and ECG) during walking and running.

Using machine learning to predict PPI sites can mitigate the cost of running expensive and timeconsuming biological experiments. Here we propose PPISP-XGBoost, a novel PPI sites prediction method based on eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). First, the characteristic information of protein is extracted through the pseudo-position specific scoring matrix (PsePSSM), pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC), hydropathy index and solvent accessible surface area (ASA) under the sliding window. Next, these raw features are preprocessed to obtain more optimal representations in order to achieve better prediction. In particular, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is used to circumvent class imbalance, and the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is applied to remove redundant characteristics. Finally, these optimal features are fed to the XGBoost classifier to identify PPI sites. Using PPISP-XGBoost, the prediction accuracy on the training dataset Dset186 reaches 85.4%, and the accuracy on the independent validation datasets Dtestset72, PDBtestset164, Dset_448 and Dset_355 reaches 85.3%, 83.9%, 85.8% and 85.4%, respectively, which all show an increase in accuracy against existing PPI sites prediction methods. These results demonstrate that the PPISPXGBoost method can further enhance the prediction of PPI sites.

Methods. - We acquired surface EMG signals from the upper limb muscles of 13 ALS patients and 20 control subjects and classified them according to a novel set of muscle activity features, describing the temporal and frequency dynamic behavior of the signals, as well as measures of its complexity. Using a battery of classification approaches, we searched for the most discriminating combination of those features, as well as a suitable strategy to identify ALS. Results. - We observed significant differences between ALS patients and controls, in particular when considering features highlighting differences between forearm and hand recordings, for which classification accuracies of up to 94% were achieved. The most robust discriminations were achieved using features based on detrended fluctuation analysis and peak frequency, and classifiers such as decision trees, random forest and Adaboost. Conclusion. - The current work shows that it is possible to achieve good identification of UMN changes in ALS by taking into consideration the dynamical behavior of surface electromyographic (sEMG) data.

A BMI Based on Motor Imagery and Attention for Commanding a Lower-Limb Robotic Exoskeleton: A Case Study	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						brain&#8211; machine interfaces; EEG; exoskeleton; motor imagery	EEG; TIME; GAIT	Lower-limb robotic exoskeletons are wearable devices that can be beneficial for people with lower-extremity motor impairment because they can be valuable in rehabilitation or assistance. These devices can be controlled mentally by means of brain-machine interfaces (BMI). The aim of the present study was the design of a BMI based on motor imagery (MI) to control the gait of a lower-limb exoskeleton. The evaluation is carried out with able-bodied subjects as a preliminary study since potential users are people with motor limitations. The proposed control works as a state machine, i.e., the decoding algorithm is different to start (standing still) and to stop (walking). The BMI combines two different paradigms for reducing the false triggering rate (when the BMI identifies irrelevant brain tasks as MI), one based on motor imagery and another one based on the attention to the gait of the user. Research was divided into two parts. First, during the training phase, results showed an average accuracy of 68.44 +/- 8.46% for the MI paradigm and 65.45 +/- 5.53% for the attention paradigm. Then, during the test phase, the exoskeleton was controlled by the BMI and the average performance was 64.50 +/- 10.66%, with very few false positives. Participants completed various sessions and there was a significant improvement over time. These results indicate that, after several sessions, the developed system may be employed for controlling a lower-limb exoskeleton, which could benefit people with motor impairment as an assistance device and/or as a therapeutic approach with very limited false activations.

Data from 441 outpatients with epilepsy were included; of these, 433 patients met the 12 clinical characteristic criteria and were divided into training (n = 304) and experimental (n = 129) groups. After descriptive statistics were analyzed, cross-validation was used to select the optimal model. The random forest (RF) algorithm was combined with the redundancy analysis (RDA) algorithm; then, optimal feature selection and resampling were carried out after removing linear redundancy information. The features that contributed more to multiple outcomes were selected. Finally, the external traceability of the model was evaluated using the follow-up data. The RF algorithm was the best prediction model for both MMSE and MoCA outcomes. Finally, seven markers were screened by overlapping the top ten important features for MMSE ranked by RF modeling, those ranked for MoCA ranked by RF modeling, and those for both assessments ranked by RDA. The optimal combination of features were namely, sex, age, age of onset, seizure frequency, brain MRI abnormalities, epileptiform discharge in EEG and usage of drugs. which was the most efficient in predicting outcomes of MMSE, MoCA, and both assessments.

The Music of Silence: Part I: Responses to Musical Imagery Encode Melodic Expectations and Acoustics	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory cortex; cortical decoding; melodic expectation; musical imagery; predictive coding	AUDITORY IMAGERY; PERCEPTION; SPEECH; CORTEX; TRACKING; EMOTION; ROLES; LEVEL; SOUND; FMRI	Musical imagery is the voluntary internal hearing of music in the mind without the need for physical action or external stimulation. Numerous studies have already revealed brain areas activated during imagery. However, it remains unclear to what extent imagined music responses preserve the detailed temporal dynamics of the acoustic stimulus envelope and, crucially, whether melodic expectations play any role in modulating responses to imagined music, as they prominently do during listening. These modulations are important as they reflect aspects of the human musical experience, such as its acquisition, engagement, and enjoyment. This study explored the nature of these modulations in imagined music based on EEG recordings from 21 professional musicians (6 females and 15 males). Regression analyses were conducted to demonstrate that imagined neural signals can be predicted accurately, similarly to the listening task, and were sufficiently robust to allow for accurate identification of the imagined musical piece from the EEG. In doing so, our results indicate that imagery and listening tasks elicited an overlapping but distinctive topography of neural responses to sound acoustics, which is in line with previous fMRI literature. Melodic expectation, however, evoked very similar frontal spatial activation in both conditions, suggesting that they are supported by the same underlying mechanisms. Finally, neural responses induced by imagery exhibited a specific transformation from the listening condition, which primarily included a relative delay and a polarity inversion of the response. This transformation demonstrates the top-down predictive nature of the expectation mechanisms arising during both listening and imagery.	[Marion, Guilhem; Liberto, Giovanni M.

The WT relies on a prototype signal that is called the mother wavelet. However, there is no single universal wavelet that fits all signals. Thus, the selection of mother wavelet function might be challenging to represent the signal to achieve the optimum performance. There are some studies to determine the optimal mother wavelet for other biomedical signals; however, there exists no evaluation for steady-state visually-evoked potentials (SSVEP) signals that becomes very popular among signals manipulated for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) recently. This study aims to explore, if any, the mother wavelet that suits best to represent SSVEP signals for classification purposes in BCIs. In this study, three common wavelet-based features (variance, energy, and entropy) extracted from SSVEP signals for five distinct EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) were classified to determine three different user commands using six fundamental classifier algorithms. The study was repeated for six different commonly-used mother wavelet functions (haar, daubechies, symlet, coiflet, biorthogonal, and reverse biorthogonal). The best discrimination was obtained with an accuracy of 100% and the average of 75.85%. Besides, ensemble learner gives the highest accuracies for half of the trials. Haar wavelet had the best performance in representing SSVEP signals among other all mother wavelets adopted in this study. Concomitantly, all three features of energy, variance, and entropy should be used together since none of these features had superior classifier performance alone.

Edge deep learning for neural implants: a case study of seizure detection and prediction	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural interface; machine learning; deep learning; edge computing; CNN; LSTM; seizure detection	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; NETWORKS; NEUROSTIMULATION; DESIGN	Objective. Implanted devices providing real-time neural activity classification and control are increasingly used to treat neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Classification performance is critical to identifying brain states appropriate for the therapeutic action (e.g. neural stimulation). However, advanced algorithms that have shown promise in offline studies, in particular deep learning (DL) methods, have not been deployed on resource-restrained neural implants. Here, we designed and optimized three DL models or edge deployment and evaluated their inference performance in a case study of seizure detection. Approach. A deep neural network (DNN), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network were designed and trained with TensorFlow to classify ictal, preictal, and interictal phases from the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database. A sliding window based weighted majority voting algorithm was developed to detect seizure events based on each DL model's classification results. After iterative model compression and coefficient quantization, the algorithms were deployed on a general-purpose, off-the-shelf microcontroller for real-time testing. Inference sensitivity, false positive rate (FPR), execution time, memory size, and power consumption were quantified. Main results. For seizure event detection, the sensitivity and FPR for the DNN, CNN, and LSTM models were 87.36%/0.169 h(-1), 96.70%/0.102 h(-1), and 97.61%/0.071 h(-1), respectively. Predicting seizures for early warnings was also feasible. The LSTM model achieved the best overall performance at the expense of the highest power. The DNN model achieved the shortest execution time. The CNN model showed advantages in balanced performance and power with minimum memory requirement. The implemented model compression and quantization achieved a significant saving of power and memory with an accuracy degradation of less than 0.5%. Significance. Inference with embedded DL models achieved performance comparable to many prior implementations that had no time or computational resource limitations. Generic microcontrollers can provide the required memory and computational resources, while model designs can be migrated to application-specific integrated circuits for further optimization and power saving. The results suggest that edge DL inference is a feasible option for future neural implants to improve classification performance and therapeutic outcomes.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to establish a channel for direct interaction between the human brain and the external world without the need for muscle or nerve control. The P300 speller, one of the most widely used BCI applications, presents a selection of characters to the user and performs character recognition by identifying P300 event-related potentials from the EEG. Such P300-based BCI systems can reach good levels of accuracy but are difficult to use in day-to-day life due to redundancy and noisy signal. A room for improvement should be considered. We propose a novel hybrid feature selection method for the P300-based BCI system to address the problem of feature redundancy, which combines the Menger curvature and linear discriminant analysis. Approach. First, selected strategies are applied separately to a given dataset to estimate the gain for application to each feature. Then, each generated value set is ranked in descending order and judged by a predefined criterion to be suitable in classification models. The intersection of the two approaches is then evaluated to identify an optimal feature subset. Main results. The proposed method is evaluated using three public datasets, i.e. BCI Competition III dataset II, brain/neural computer interaction Horizon dataset, and Lausanne Federal Institute of Technology dataset. Experimental results indicate that compared with other typical feature selection and classification methods, our proposed method has better or comparable performance. Significance. Additionally, our proposed method can achieve the best classification accuracy after all epochs in three datasets. In summary, our proposed method provides a new way to enhance the performance of the P300-based BCI speller.

In this paper, we propose a new framework based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) features along with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM)-based classifiers. For this purpose, firstly, we introduce EMD to decompose EEG signals into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which actually are used as the input features of the brainwave classification for the character-writing application. We hypothesize that EMD along with the appropriate IMF is quite powerful for the brainwave classification, in terms of character applications, because of the wavelet-like decomposition without any down sampling process. Secondly, by getting motivated with shallow learning classifiers, we can provide promising performance for the classification of binary classes, GMM and KELM, which are applied for the learning of features along with the brainwave classification. Lastly, we propose a new method by combining GMM and KELM to fuse the merits of different classifiers. Moreover, the proposed methods are validated by using the volunteer-independent 5-fold cross-validation and accuracy as a standard measurement. The experimental results showed that EMD with the proper IMF achieved better results than the conventional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) feature. Moreover, we found that the EMD feature along with the GMM/KELM-based classifier provides the average accuracy of 77.40% and 80.10%, respectively, which could perform better than the conventional methods where we use DWT along with the artificial neural network classifier in order to get the average accuracy of 80.60%. Furthermore, we obtained the improved performance by combining GMM and KELM, i.e., average accuracy of 80.60%. These outcomes exhibit the usefulness of the EMD feature combining with GMM and KELM based classifiers for the brainwave classification in terms of the Character-Writing application, which do not require any limb movement and stimulus.

Variability of the clinical expression of KCNB1 encephalopathy	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						Developmental delay; Epileptic encephalopathy; Exome; Intellectual disability; KCNB1; West's syndrome	ILAE COMMISSION; MUTATIONS; CLASSIFICATION	Introduction. The KCNB1 gene encodes a voltage-dependent potassium channel that regulates transmembrane currents in pyramidal neurons. Heterozygous variants have recently been associated with early-onset epileptic encephalopathies and intellectual disability, but their clinical characterisation has not yet been fully defined. Aim. To describe the clinical spectrum associated with variants of KCNB1 in paediatric patients. Patients and methods. Retrospective study of four patients from three families with KCNB1 encephalopathy, including an analysis of the clinical and electroencephalographic features of epilepsy, associated neurological manifestations and neurodevelopmental pattern. Results. In two of them, the mutation in KCNB1 was de novo; the other two, who were sisters, inherited the variant from a parent with germline mosaicism. All had mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, two patients had autistic spectrum disorder and two had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Only case 2 displayed alterations in the MRI brain scan: progressive cortical atrophy. Three of them developed epilepsy (cases 1-3). Case 1: onset at 9.5 months with West syndrome that was well controlled with vigabatrine and zonisamide. Case 2: onset at 13 months with West syndrome, evolutionary development of polymorphic seizures (atonic, hypermotor, dysautonomic and tonic) that were refractory to 10 antiepileptic drugs and corticosteroids. Accompanied by a movement disorder characterised by ataxia, dyskinesias and tremor. Case 3: onset at 14.5 years with atonic seizures, multifocal EEG pattern and adequate control with levetiracetam. Conclusions. KCNB1 encephalopathy has a heterogeneous natural history, mainly with respect to epilepsy, ranging from patients with refractory epilepsy to patients without any epileptic seizures. All had neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder, independent of epilepsy.

Analysis of VEM is currently performed in most institutions using a freeform report, a time-consuming process resulting in a non-standardized report, limiting the use of this essential diagnostic tool. Herein we present a pilot feasibility study of our experience with "Digital Semiology" (DS), a novel seizure encoding software. It allows semiautomated annotation of the videos of suspected events from a predetermined, hierarchal set of options, with highly detailed semiologic descriptions, somatic localization, and timing. In addition, the software's semiologic extrapolation functions identify characteristics of focal seizures and PNES, sequences compatible with a Jacksonian march, and risk factors for SUDEP. Sixty episodes from a mixed adult and pediatric cohort from one level 4 epilepsy center VEM archives were analyzed using DS and the reports were compared with the standard freeform ones, written by the same epileptologists. The behavioral characteristics appearing in the DS and freeform reports overlapped by 78-80%. Encoding of one episode using DS required an average of 18 min 13 s (standard deviation: 14 min and 16 s). The focality function identified 19 out of 43 focal episodes, with a sensitivity of 45.45% (CI 30.39-61.15%) and specificity of 87.50% (CI 61.65-98.45%). The PNES function identified 6 of 12 PNES episodes, with a sensitivity of 50% (95% CI 21.09-78.91%) and specificity of 97.2 (95% CI 88.93-99.95%). Eleven events of GTCS triggered the SUDEP risk alert. Overall, these results show that video recordings of suspected seizures can be encoded using the DS software in a precise manner, offering the added benefit of semiologic alerts. The present study represents an important step toward the formation of an annotated video archive, to be used for machine learning purposes. This will further the goal of automated VEM analysis, ultimately contributing to wider utilization of VEM and therefore to the reduction of the treatment gap in epilepsy.</p>	[Benoliel, Tal; Kreigsberg, Bilha; Tsizin, Evgeny; Arviv, Oshrit; Ekstein, Dana; Medvedovsky, Mordekhay] Hadassah Med Org, Agnes Ginges Ctr Human Neurogenet, Dept Neurol, Jerusalem, Israel; [Benoliel, Tal; Gilboa, Tal; Kreigsberg, Bilha; Arviv, Oshrit; Ekstein, Dana] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Med, Jerusalem, Israel; [Gilboa, Tal] Hadassah Med Org, Pediat Neurol Unit, Jerusalem, Israel; [Yahav, Paz Har-Shai] Bar Ilan Univ, Leslie & Susan Gonda Goldschmied Multidisciplinar, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Zelker, Revital; Kreigsberg, Bilha] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Israel & Hadassah Med Org, Sch Nursing, Jerusalem, Israel		Benoliel, T (corresponding author), Hadassah Med Org, Agnes Ginges Ctr Human Neurogenet, Dept Neurol, Jerusalem, Israel.; Benoliel, T (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Med, Jerusalem, Israel.	tal.benoliel@gmail.com		Har-shai Yahav, Paz/0000-0002-3666-3338	Prusiner-Abramsky research award; Orion foundation	Prusiner-Abramsky research award; Orion foundation	The research was supported by the Prusiner-Abramsky research award and the Orion foundation.		28	0	0	0	0	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-2295			FRONT NEUROL	Front.

However, practical reasons may often dictate to eventually switch off decoder adaptation and proceed with BCI control under a fixed BCI model, a situation that remains rather unexplored. This work studies the existence and magnitude of potential post-adaptation effects on system performance, subject learning and brain signal modulation stability in a state-of-the-art, coadaptive training regime inspired by a game-like design. The results extracted in a cohort of 20 able-bodied individuals reveal that ceasing classifier adaptation after three runs (approx. 30 min) of a single-session training protocol had no significant impact on any of the examined BCI control and learning aspects in the remaining two runs (about 20 min) with a fixed classifier. Fifteen individuals achieved accuracies that are better than chance level and allowed them to successfully execute the given task. These findings alleviate a major concern regarding the applicability of coadaptive MI BCI training, thus helping to further establish this training approach and allow full exploitation of its benefits.

An integrated care pathway (ICP), defining a reproducible rehabilitation assessment and process, may provide a structured frame within investigated outcomes and individual predictors of response to treatment, including neurophysiological and neurogenetic biomarkers. Predictors may differ for different interventions, suggesting clues to personalize and optimize rehabilitation. To date, a large representative Italian cohort study focusing on individual variability of response to an evidence-based ICP is lacking, and predictors of individual response to rehabilitation are largely unexplored. This paper describes a multicenter study protocol to prospectively investigate outcomes and predictors of response to an evidence-based ICP in a large Italian cohort of stroke survivors undergoing post-acute inpatient rehabilitation. Methods: All patients with diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke confirmed both by clinical and brain imaging evaluation, admitted to four intensive rehabilitation units (adopting the same stroke rehabilitation ICP) within 30 days from the acute event, aged 18+, and providing informed consent will be enrolled (expected sample: 270 patients). Measures will be taken at admission (T0), at discharge (T1), and at follow-up 6 months after a stroke (T2), including clinical data, nutritional, functional, neurological, and neuropsychological measures, electroencephalography and motor evoked potentials, and analysis of neurogenetic biomarkers. Statistics: In addition to classical multivariate logistic regression analysis, advanced machine learning algorithms will be cross-validated to achieve data-driven prognosis prediction models. Discussion: By identifying data-driven prognosis prediction models in stroke rehabilitation, this study might contribute to the development of patient-oriented therapy and to optimize rehabilitation outcomes.

Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) is an effective treatment for controlling seizures in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are not suitable candidates for resection surgery. A lack of tools for detecting and characterizing potential response biomarkers, however, contributes to a limited understanding of mechanisms by which RNS improves seizure control. We developed a method to quantify ictal frequency modulation, previously identified as a biomarker of clinical responsiveness to RNS. Approach. Frequency modulation is characterized by shifts in power across spectral bands during ictal events, over several months of neurostimulation. This effect was quantified by partitioning each seizure pattern into segments with distinct spectral content and measuring the extent of change from the baseline distribution of spectral content using the squared earth mover's distance. Main results. We analyzed intracranial electroencephalography data from 13 patients who received RNS therapy, six of whom exhibited frequency modulation on expert evaluation. Patients in the frequency modulation group had, on average, significantly larger and more sustained changes in their squared earth mover's distances (mean = 13.97 x 10(-3) +/- 1.197 x 10(-3)). In contrast, those patients without expert-identified frequency modulation exhibited statistically insignificant or negligible distances (mean = 4.994 x 10(-3) +/- 0.732 x 10(-3)). Significance. This method is the first step towards a quantitative, feedback-driven system for systematically optimizing RNS stimulation parameters, with an ultimate goal of truly personalized closed-loop therapy for epilepsy.

Although potentially impactful factors for MI practice have been identified, issues regarding system feedback and the underlying neurophysiological alterations such practice can produce still remain. In this work, we investigated how feedback can affect the outcome of a MI practice protocol with a brain-computer interface (BCI), when providing: no feedback, sham feedback or actual neurofeedback. We assessed whether event-related desynchronization occurrence (EO) and classification accuracy (CA) varied in each scenario. We found that: (i) practice without feedback did not enhance either metric; (ii) sham feedback yielded a wider variety of outcomes than for the control group, but no statistical significance was observed at the group level; (iii) although users trained to adapt to the BCI classifier, improvements in CA and both contra and ipsilateral EO were observed for the neurofeedback group: average CA increased from (71.3 +/- 3.7) % to (75.5 +/- 5.8) %, whereas median EO increased approximately 5% per session This study reinforces the relevance of neurofeedback in MI learning and provides new insights into neurophysiological correlates throughout the practice protocol. We also hint at a possible placebo effect that provides significant correlations between EO and CA only for the sham group.

Analogous computations in working memory input, output and motor gating: Electrophysiological and computational modeling evidence	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							N-BACK TASK; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BASAL-GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FRONTAL-CORTEX; INHIBITORY CONTROL; ACTION SELECTION; DECISION-MAKING; MECHANISMS	Adaptive cognitive-control involves a hierarchical cortico-striatal gating system that supports selective updating, maintenance, and retrieval of useful cognitive and motor information. Here, we developed a task that independently manipulates selective gating operations into working-memory (input gating), from working-memory (output gating), and of responses (motor gating) and tested the neural dynamics and computational principles that support them. Increases in gating demands, captured by gate switches, were expressed by distinct EEG correlates at each gating level that evolved dynamically in partially overlapping time windows. Further, categorical representations of specific maintained items and of motor responses could be decoded from EEG when the corresponding gate was switching, thereby linking gating operations to prioritization. Finally, gate switching at all levels was related to increases in the motor decision threshold as quantified by the drift diffusion model. Together these results support the notion that cognitive gating operations scaffold on top of mechanisms involved in motor gating. Author summary How do humans decide which information is relevant to attend to in memory, which cognitive operation to take, and when? Flexibly updating, maintenance and retrieval of relevant information from working memory (WM) are thought to be managed by gating computations in the frontostriatal network, supporting higher order learning and cognitive flexibility. Using the reference-back-2 task, we tested the key properties of gating. Namely that they are selective ("content-addressable") and that principles of cognitive "actions" (including input gating of WM, output gating from WM) are scaffold on top of the motor gating operations. Using trial-by-trial EEG indexing and quantitative computational modeling (the hierarchical drift-diffusion model) we showed that action selection at all three levels of gating have separable neural signatures but they operate partly in parallel, such that decisions about a response are processed to some degree even while the identity of the cognitive rule were uncertain. Furthermore, we showed analogous computations across levels of gating as selection of WM representation and of motor action lead to increase in the estimated decision threshold and to enhanced neural coding of the selected information thereby providing a novel link between WM gating and WM prioritization.

Detection and early prediction of mental fatigue (i.e. shifts in vigilance), could be used to adapt neuromodulation strategies to effectively treat patients suffering from brain injury and other indications with prominent chronic mental fatigue. Approach. In this study, we analyzed electrocorticography (ECoG) signals chronically recorded from two healthy non-human primates (NHP) as they performed a sustained attention task over extended periods of time. We employed a set of spectrotemporal and connectivity biomarkers of the ECoG signals to identify periods of mental fatigue and a gradient boosting classifier to predict performance, up to several seconds prior to the behavioral response. Main results. Wavelet entropy and the instantaneous amplitude and frequency were among the best single features across sessions in both NHPs. The classification performance using higher order spectral-temporal (HOST) features was significantly higher than that of conventional spectral power features in both NHPs. Across the 99 sessions analyzed, average F1 scores of 77.5% +/- 8.2% and 91.2% +/- 3.6%, and accuracy of 79.5% +/- 8.9% and 87.6% +/- 3.9% for the classifier were obtained for each animal, respectively. Significance. Our results here demonstrate the feasibility of predicting performance and detecting periods of mental fatigue by analyzing ECoG signals, and that this general approach, in principle, could be used for closed-loop control of neuromodulation strategies.

Towards the Classification of Error-Related Potentials using Riemannian Geometry	2021 43RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE, Elsevier, Inst Engn & Technol			NEURAL SYSTEM	The error-related potential (ErrP) is an event-related potential (ERP) evoked by an experimental participant's recognition of an error during task performance. ErrPs, originally described by cognitive psychologists, have been adopted for use in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the detection and correction of errors, and the online refinement of decoding algorithms. Riemannian geometry-based feature extraction and classification is a new approach to BCI which shows good performance in a range of experimental paradigms, but has yet to be applied to the classification of ErrPs. Here, we describe an experiment that elicited ErrPs in seven normal participants performing a visual discrimination task. Audio feedback was provided on each trial. We used multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to classify ErrPs (success/failure), comparing a Riemannian geometry-based method to a traditional approach that computes time-point features. Overall, the Riemannian approach outperformed the traditional approach (78.2% versus 75.9% accuracy, p <0.05); this difference was statistically significant (p <0.05) in three of seven participants. These results indicate that the Riemannian approach better captured the features from feedback-elicited ErrPs, and may have application in BCI for error detection and correction.

ADHD presents with a high prevalence of comorbid disorders such as conduct disorder (CD). The lack of definitive confirmatory diagnostic tests for ADHD and CD make diagnosis challenging. The distinction between ADHD, ADHD + CD and CD is important as the course and treatment are different. Electrocardiography (ECG) signals may become altered in behavioral disorders due to brain-heart autonomic interactions. We have developed a software tool to categorize ADHD, ADHD + CD and CD automatically on ECG signals. Method: ECG signals from participants were decomposed using empirical wavelet transform into various modes, from which entropy features were extracted. Robust ten-fold cross-validation with adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) and z-score normalization were performed at each fold. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique was employed to determine the variability within the three classes, and obtained the most discriminatory features. Highly significant entropy features were then fed to classifiers. Results: Our model yielded the best classification results with the bagged tree classifier: 87.19%, 87.71% and 86.29% for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed expert system can potentially assist mental health professionals in the stratification of the three classes, for appropriate intervention using accessible ECG signals.

Visual hypnotic hallucinations differ in many ways from regular mental images. For example, they are usually experienced as automatic, vivid, and real images, typically compromising the sense of reality. While both hypnotic hallucination and mental imagery are believed to mainly rely on the activation of the visual cortex via top-down mechanisms, it is unknown how they differ in the neural processes they engage. Here we used an adaptation paradigm to test and compare top-down processing between hypnotic hallucination, mental imagery, and visual perception in very highly hypnotisable individuals whose ability to hallucinate was assessed. By measuring the N170/VPP event-related complex and using multivariate decoding analysis, we found that hypnotic hallucination of faces involves greater top-down activation of sensory processing through lateralised neural mechanisms in the right hemisphere compared to mental imagery. Our findings suggest that the neural signatures that distinguish hypnotically hallucinated faces from imagined faces lie in the right brain hemisphere.

It is a very tedious task for clinicians to monitor the entire sleep durations of the subjects and analyse the sleep staging in traditional and manual laboratory environmental methods. For the purpose of accurate diagnosis of different sleep disorders, we have considered the automated analysis of sleep epochs, which were collected from the subjects during sleep time. The complete process of an automated approach of sleep stages' classification is majorly executed through four steps: pre-processing the raw signals, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In this study, we have extracted 12 statistical properties from input signals. The proposed models are tested in three different combinations of features sets. In the first experiment, the feature set contained all the 12 features. The second and third experiments were conducted with the nine and five best features. The patient records come from the ISRUC-Sleep database. The highest classification accuracy was achieved for sleep staging through combinations with the five feature set. From the categories of the subjects, the reported accuracy results were found to exceed above 90%. As per the outcome from the proposed system the random forest classification techniques achieved best accuracy incomparable to that of the other two classifiers.

Endogenous memory reactivation during sleep in humans is clocked by slow oscillation-spindle complexes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; BENEFITS; BRAIN	Sleep is thought to support memory consolidation via reactivation of prior experiences, with particular electrophysiological sleep signatures (slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles) gating the information flow between relevant brain areas. However, empirical evidence for a role of endogenous memory reactivation (i.e., without experimentally delivered memory cues) for consolidation in humans is lacking. Here, we devised a paradigm in which participants acquired associative memories before taking a nap. Multivariate decoding was then used to capture endogenous memory reactivation during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in surface EEG recordings. Our results reveal reactivation of learning material during SO-spindle complexes, with the precision of SO-spindle coupling predicting reactivation strength. Critically, reactivation strength (i.e. classifier evidence in favor of the previously studied stimulus category) in turn predicts the level of consolidation across participants. These results elucidate the memory function of sleep in humans and emphasize the importance of SOs and spindles in clocking endogenous consolidation processes. Sleep after learning helps to strengthen new memories. Here, the authors link this memory benefit to the reactivation of learning experiences when two endogenous sleep rhythms-slow oscillations and sleep spindles-coincide.

Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Visual Evoked Potential-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces for Motor Rehabilitation Applications: Systematic Review and Future Directions	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						BCI; visual stimulation; classification; performance metrics; steady state visually evoked potentials; P300; functional electrical stimulation; virtual reality	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; COVERT ATTENTION; UPPER EXTREMITY; P300; CLASSIFICATION; STROKE; BCI; NEUROREHABILITATION; COMMUNICATION; MOVEMENT	Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a technology that uses electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to control external devices, such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). Visual BCI paradigms based on P300 and Steady State Visually Evoked potentials (SSVEP) have shown high potential for clinical purposes. Numerous studies have been published on P300- and SSVEP-based non-invasive BCIs, but many of them present two shortcomings: (1) they are not aimed for motor rehabilitation applications, and (2) they do not report in detail the artificial intelligence (AI) methods used for classification, or their performance metrics. To address this gap, in this paper the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology was applied to prepare a systematic literature review (SLR). Papers older than 10 years, repeated or not related to a motor rehabilitation application, were excluded. Of all the studies, 51.02% referred to theoretical analysis of classification algorithms. Of the remaining, 28.48% were for spelling, 12.73% for diverse applications (control of wheelchair or home appliances), and only 7.77% were focused on motor rehabilitation. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and quality screening was performed, 34 articles were selected. Of them, 26.47% used the P300 and 55.8% the SSVEP signal. Five applications categories were established: Rehabilitation Systems (17.64%), Virtual Reality environments (23.52%), FES (17.64%), Orthosis (29.41%), and Prosthesis (11.76%). Of all the works, only four performed tests with patients. The most reported machine learning (ML) algorithms used for classification were linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (48.64%) and support vector machine (16.21%), while only one study used a deep learning algorithm: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The reported accuracy ranged from 38.02 to 100%, and the Information Transfer Rate from 1.55 to 49.25 bits per minute. While LDA is still the most used AI algorithm, CNN has shown promising results, but due to their high technical implementation requirements, many researchers do not justify its implementation as worthwile. To achieve quick and accurate online BCIs for motor rehabilitation applications, future works on SSVEP-, P300-based and hybrid BCIs should focus on optimizing the visual stimulation module and the training stage of ML and DL algorithms.

Applications range from the brain (EEG), the heart (ECG) and the financial markets (bid prices), to the sun (solar intensity readings) and river flows. HVGs have also been extended to image-based pattern recognition. Efficient and scalable online HVG construction is vital to extending HVG-based time series analysis to long, streaming, and distributed real-world time series data. The fastest scalable method for constructing HVGs today is the binary search tree (BST) encoding-decoding algorithm, which is O(n log n) in time series length for balanced data such as noise. However, in practice BST is highly sensitive to the geometric structure of a time series and its performance degrades significantly towards O(n(2)) when data possess long term dependencies or when the sample frequency is high, which occur regularly in practice. To avoid these problems we leverage an O(n) ordered rooted tree representation of time series that is (graph) dual to the HVG. We demonstrate that this representation leads to an algorithm for HVG construction that is agnostic with respect to the geometry and auto-correlations of the underlying data. Moreover, it possesses an efficient branch fusion operation for tree merging, leading to the idea of a bipartite HVG introduced in this paper, which allows HVGs for very large time series to be constructed efficiently in parallel. After introducing our method and algorithms for parallel construction of HVGs we report on experimental benchmarks comparing their real-world performance to existing approaches on long time series. On data sampled from fractional Brownian motions, deterministic chaotic systems, brain EEG recordings, and the financial markets, our dual tree algorithms significantly outperform previous methods.

Current cBCI systems usually require all collaborators to execute the same mental tasks (common-work strategy). However, it is still unclear whether the system performance will be improved by assigning different tasks to collaborators (division-of-work strategy) while keeping the total tasks unchanged. Therefore, we studied a task allocation scheme of division-of-work and compared the corresponding classification accuracies with common-work strategy's. Approach This study developed an electroencephalograph (EEG)-based cBCI which had six instructions related to six different motor imagery tasks (MI-cBCI), respectively. For the common-work strategy, all five subjects as a group had the same whole instruction set and they were required to conduct the same instruction at a time. For the division-of-work strategy, every subject's instruction set was a subset of the whole one and different from each other. However, their union set was equal to the whole set. Based on the number of instructions in a subset, we divided the division-of-work strategy into four types, called "2 Tasks" horizontal ellipsis "5 Tasks." To verify the effectiveness of these strategies, we employed EEG data collected from 19 subjects who independently performed six types of MI tasks to conduct the pseudo-online classification of MI-cBCI. Main results Taking the number of tasks performed by one collaborator as the horizontal axis (two to six), the classification accuracy curve of MI-cBCI was mountain-like. The curve reached its peak at "4 Tasks," which means each subset contained four instructions. It outperformed the common-work strategy ("6 Tasks") in classification accuracy (72.29 +/- 4.43 vs. 58.53 +/- 4.36%). Significance The results demonstrate that our proposed task allocation strategy effectively enhanced the cBCI classification performance and reduced the individual workload.

Brain event-related potentials predict individual differences in inhibitory control	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EEG; STOP; MOTOR; MODELS; REGULARIZATION; IMPULSIVITY; COMPONENTS; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), the time needed to cancel an already-initiated motor response, quantifies individual differences in inhibitory control. Electrophysiological correlates of SSRT have primarily focused on late event-related potential (ERP) components over midline scalp regions from successfully inhibited stop trials. SSRT is robustly associated with the P300, there is mixed evidence for N200 involvement, and there is little information on the role of early ERP components. Here, machine learning was first used to interrogate ERPs during both successful and failed stop trials from 64 scalp electrodes at 4 ms resolution (n = 148). The most predictive model included data from both successful and failed stop trials, with a cross-validated Pearson's r of 0.32 between measured and predicted SSRT, significantly higher than null models. From successful stop trials, spatio-temporal features overlapping the N200 in right frontal areas and the P300 in frontocentral areas predicted SSRT, as did early ERP activity (<200 ms). As a demonstration of the reproducibility of these findings, the application of this model to a separate dataset of 97 participants was also significant (r = 0.29). These results show that ERPs during failed stops are relevant to SSRT, and that both early and late ERP activity contribute to individual differences in SSRT. Notably, the right lateralized N200, which predicted SSRT here, is not often observed in neurotypical adults. Both the ascending slope and peak of the P300 component predicted SSRT. These results were replicable, both within the training sample and when applied to ERPs from a separate dataset.	[Rueda-Delgado, L. M.; O'Halloran, L.; Enz, N.; Ruddy, K.

Methods: We studied 30 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery following extraoperative electrocorticography and electrooculography recordings. We determined whether high-gamma activity at 70- 110 Hz preceding saccade onset would predict upcoming ocular behaviors. We assessed how accurately the model incorporating saccade-related high-gamma modulations would localize the primary visual cortex defined by electrical stimulation. Results: The dynamic atlas demonstrated transient high-gamma suppression in the striatal cortex before saccade onset and high-gamma augmentation subsequently involving the widespread posterior brain regions. More intense striatal high-gamma suppression predicted the upcoming saccade directed to the ipsilateral side and lasting longer in duration. The bagged-tree-ensemble model demonstrated that intense saccade-related high-gamma modulations localized the visual cortex with an accuracy of 95%. Conclusions: We successfully animated the neural dynamics supporting saccadic suppression, a principal mechanism minimizing the perception of blurred vision during rapid eye movements. The primary visual cortex per se may prepare actively in advance for massive image motion expected during upcoming prolonged saccades. Significance: Measuring saccade-related electrocorticographic signals may help localize the visual cortex and avoid misperceiving physiological high-frequency activity as epileptogenic.

J	Usama, N; Niazi, IK; Dremstrup, K; Jochumsen, M				Usama, Nayab; Niazi, Imran Khan; Dremstrup, Kim; Jochumsen, Mads			Detection of Error-Related Potentials in Stroke Patients from EEG Using an Artificial Neural Network	SENSORS			English	Article						error-related potentials; brain-computer interface; calibration; neurorehabilitation; stroke; classifier interpretation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; LESIONS; PERFORMANCE; RELIABILITY; NUMBER; BCI	Error-related potentials (ErrPs) have been proposed as a means for improving brain-computer interface (BCI) performance by either correcting an incorrect action performed by the BCI or label data for continuous adaptation of the BCI to improve the performance. The latter approach could be relevant within stroke rehabilitation where BCI calibration time could be minimized by using a generalized classifier that is continuously being individualized throughout the rehabilitation session. This may be achieved if data are correctly labelled. Therefore, the aims of this study were: (1) classify single-trial ErrPs produced by individuals with stroke, (2) investigate test-retest reliability, and (3) compare different classifier calibration schemes with different classification methods (artificial neural network, ANN, and linear discriminant analysis, LDA) with waveform features as input for meaningful physiological interpretability. Twenty-five individuals with stroke operated a sham BCI on two separate days where they attempted to perform a movement after which they received feedback (error/correct) while continuous EEG was recorded. The EEG was divided into epochs: ErrPs and NonErrPs. The epochs were classified with a multi-layer perceptron ANN based on temporal features or the entire epoch. Additionally, the features were classified with shrinkage LDA. The features were waveforms of the ErrPs and NonErrPs from the sensorimotor cortex to improve the explainability and interpretation of the output of the classifiers. Three calibration schemes were tested: within-day, between-day, and across-participant. Using within-day calibration, 90% of the data were correctly classified with the entire epoch as input to the ANN; it decreased to 86% and 69% when using temporal features as input to ANN and LDA, respectively. There was poor test-retest reliability between the two days, and the other calibration schemes led to accuracies in the range of 63-72% with LDA performing the best. There was no association between the individuals' impairment level and classification accuracies. The results show that ErrPs can be classified in individuals with stroke, but that user- and session-specific calibration is needed for optimal ErrP decoding with this approach. The use of ErrP/NonErrP waveform features makes it possible to have a physiological meaningful interpretation of the output of the classifiers. The results may have implications for labelling data continuously in BCIs for stroke rehabilitation and thus potentially improve the BCI performance.

J	Wu, F; Gong, AM; Li, HY; Zhao, L; Zhang, W; Fu, YF				Wu, Fan; Gong, Anmin; Li, Hongyun; Zhao, Lei; Zhang, Wei; Fu, Yunfa			A New Subject-Specific Discriminative and Multi-Scale Filter Bank Tangent Space Mapping Method for Recognition of Multiclass Motor Imagery	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						tangent space mapping; discriminative and multiscale filter bank; multiclass motor-imagery; Riemannian geometry based classifier; electroencephalogram		Objective: Tangent Space Mapping (TSM) using the geometric structure of the covariance matrices is an effective method to recognize multiclass motor imagery (MI). Compared with the traditional CSP method, the Riemann geometric method based on TSM takes into account the nonlinear information contained in the covariance matrix, and can extract more abundant and effective features. Moreover, the method is an unsupervised operation, which can reduce the time of feature extraction. However, EEG features induced by MI mental activities of different subjects are not the same, so selection of subject-specific discriminative EEG frequency components play a vital role in the recognition of multiclass MI. In order to solve the problem, a discriminative and multi-scale filter bank tangent space mapping (DMFBTSM) algorithm is proposed in this article to design the subject-specific Filter Bank (FB) so as to effectively recognize multiclass MI tasks. Methods: On the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset, first, a non-parametric method of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) based on the sum of squared distances is used to select discriminative frequency bands for a subject; next, a multi-scale FB is generated according to the range of these frequency bands, and then decompose multi-channel EEG of the subject into multiple sub-bands combined with several time windows. Then TSM algorithm is used to estimate Riemannian tangent space features in each sub-band and finally a liner Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used for classification. Main Results: The analysis results show that the proposed discriminative FB enhances the multi-scale TSM algorithm, improves the classification accuracy and reduces the execution time during training and testing. On the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset, the average session to session classification accuracy of nine subjects reached 77.33 +/- 12.3%. When the training time and the test time are similar, the average classification accuracy is 2.56% higher than the latest TSM method based on multi-scale filter bank analysis technology. When the classification accuracy is similar, the training speed is increased by more than three times, and the test speed is increased two times more. Compared with Supervised Fisher Geodesic Minimum Distance to the Mean (Supervised FGMDRM), another new variant based on Riemann geometry classifier, the average accuracy is 3.36% higher, we also compared with the latest Deep Learning method, and the average accuracy of 10-fold cross validation improved by 2.58%. Conclusion: Research shows that the proposed DMFBTSM algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of MI tasks. Significance: Compared with the MFBTSM algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this article is expected to select frequency bands with good separability for specific subject to improve the classification accuracy of multiclass MI tasks and reduce the feature dimension to reduce training time and testing time.

Rajendra			Automated Sleep apnea detection using optimal duration-frequency concentrated wavelet-based features of pulse oximetry signals	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Classification; SpO(2); Wavelets; Sleep apnea; Filter banks	EEG SIGNALS; SATURATION; PREDICTION; DESIGN	Sleep apnea is a potential sleep disorder, which deteriorates the quality of sleep. It is characterized by the obstruction in nasal airflow, which results in a low concentration of oxygen in the blood. Though polysomnography (PSG) is considered as a gold standard for diagnosing sleep apnea, it is arduous, demanding, expensive and inconvenient to the patients. This study presents an effective, efficient and sustainable sleep apnea automated detection system using pulse oximetry signals (SpO(2)), which indicate the percentage of oxygen content in the blood. The conventional methods, which employ PSG recordings are computationally intensive and costly. Nowadays, the focus is on non-invasive and portable devices for higher convenience and cost-effective diagnosis. In this work, we have used optimal duration-bandwidth concentrated wavelet transform to decompose the SpO(2) signals into various sub-bands (SBs). The Shannon entropy features are extracted from various SBs coefficients. These features are then fed to various supervised machine learning algorithms, including decision trees and ensemble algorithms for automated detection of sleep apnea. The proposed model has attained the highest accuracy of 95.97%, and area under the receivers operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.98 for optimal wavelet-based Shannon entropy features when an ensemble boosting technique called random under-sampling boosting (RUSBoost) is employed with ten-fold cross-validation strategy. Thus, the proposed model is portable, economical, and accurate which can be used even at homes.

NEUROFEEDBACK; BRAIN; COMMUNICATION; NETWORK; SINGLE	This paper outlines the prevalent challenges for the emerging wearable neurotechnology in modern IoT systems. We underline the recent insights in neuroscience and the ability to decode the brain circuitry with high confidence. We address the imminent challenges of translating the advanced high-cost medical setup for neural activity recording to a commodity IoT system. Emphasis is placed on non-invasive wearable sensing technology and the advances in data analytic for neurosignals. In particular, we focus on human-in-the-loop IoT systems where privacy concerns of leaking private human state and energy limitations for local data processing lay significant constraints on such systems architecture. Along the way, we envision applications that will reach their full potential and provide the promised functionality by embedding wearable neurotechnology in their design. We end the paper by highlighting the prominent research opportunities and challenges for designing and developing the next generation of low-cost, energy-efficient, privacy-aware, and ubiquitous wearable neurotechnology. Most of these research challenges need to be addressed from a multi-disciplinary approach. Researchers from various communities need to coordinate and collaborate to successfully advance the research, development, and standardization of such neurotechnologies for the larger benefit of society.

To investigate the dynamical encoding of image statistics in the human brain, we measured visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for 166 natural textures and their synthetic versions, and performed a reverse-correlation analysis of the VEPs and representative texture statistics of the image. The analysis revealed occipital VEP components strongly correlated with particular texture statistics. VEPs correlated with low-level statistics, such as subband SDs, emerged rapidly from 100 to 250 ms in a spatial frequency dependent manner. VEPs correlated with higher-order statistics, such as subband kurtosis and cross-band correlations, were observed at slightly later times. Moreover, these robust correlations enabled us to inversely estimate texture statistics from VEP signals via linear regression and to reconstruct texture images that appear similar to those synthesized with the original statistics. Additionally, we found significant differences in VEPs at 200-300 ms between some natural textures and their Portilla-Simoncelli (PS) synthesized versions, even though they shared almost identical texture statistics. This differential VEP was related to the perceptual "unnaturalness" of PS-synthesized textures. These results suggest that the visual cortex rapidly encodes image statistics hidden in natural textures specifically enough to predict the visual appearance of a texture, while it also represents high-level information beyond image statistics, and that electroencephalography can be used to decode these cortical signals.

These mild injuries are not visible on routine clinical imaging. The potential clinical role of a specific imaging biomarker be it diagnostic, prognostic or directing and monitoring progress of personalised treatment and rehabilitation has driven the exploration of several new neuroimaging modalities. This systematic review examined the evidence for magnetoencephalography (MEG) to provide an imaging biomarker in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methods: Our review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO: CRD42019151387. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, trial registers, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and conference abstracts and identified 37 papers describing MEG changes in mTBI eligible for inclusion. Since meta-analysis was not possible, based on the heterogeneity of reported outcomes, we provide a narrative synthesis of results. Results: The two most promising MEG biomarkers are excess resting state low frequency power, and widespread connectivity changes in all frequency bands. These may represent biomarkers with potential for diagnostic application, which reflect time sensitive changes, or may be capable of offering clinically relevant prognostic information. In addition, the rich data that MEG produces are well-suited to new methods of machine learning analysis, which is now being actively explored. Interpretation: MEG reveals several promising biomarkers, in the absence of structural abnormalities demonstrable with either computerised tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This review has not identified sufficient evidence to support routine clinical use of MEG in mTBI currently. However, verifying MEG's potential would help meet an urgent clinical need within civilian, sports and military medicine.

Measuring the cognitive load of software developers: An extended Systematic Mapping Study	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cognitive load; Machine learning; Software engineering; Systematic Mapping Study	EEG; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA	Context: Cognitive load in software engineering refers to the mental effort users spend while reading software artifacts. The cognitive load can vary according to tasks and across developers. Researchers have measured developers' cognitive load for different purposes, such as understanding its impact on productivity and software quality. Thus, researchers and practitioners can use cognitive load measures for solving many aspects of software engineering problems. Problem: However, a lack of a classification of dimensions on cognitive load measures in software engineering makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to obtain research trends to advance scientific knowledge or apply it in software projects. Objective: This article aims to classify different aspects of cognitive load measures in software engineering and identify challenges for further research. Method: We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS), which started with 4,175 articles gathered from 11 search engines and then narrowed down to 63 primary studies. Results: Our main findings are: (1) 43% (27/63) of the primary studies focused on applying a combination of sensors; (2) 81% (51/63) of the selected works were validation studies; (3) 83% (52/63) of the primary studies analyzed cognitive load while developers performed programming tasks. Moreover, we created a classification scheme based on the answers to our research questions. Conclusion: despite the production of a significant amount of studies on cognitive load in software engineering, there are still many challenges to be solved in this particular field for effectively measuring the cognitive load in software engineering. Therefore, this work provided directions for future studies on cognitive load measurement in software engineering.

In order to probe and understand the complex interactions between sleep and health, the ability to model, track, and modulate sleep in preclinical animal models is vital. While various methods have been described for scoring experimental sleep recordings, few are designed to work in real time - a prerequisite for closed-loop sleep manipulation. In the present study, we have developed algorithms and software to classify sleep in real time and validated it on C57BL/6 mice (n = 8). Hidden Markov models of baseline sleep dynamics were fitted using an unsupervised algorithm to electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) data for each mouse, and were able to classify sleep in a manner highly concordant with manual scoring (Cohen's Kappa >75%) up to 3 weeks after model construction. This approach produced reasonably accurate estimates of common sleep metrics (proportion, mean duration, and number of bouts). After construction, the models were used to track sleep in real time and accomplish selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep restriction by triggering non-invasive somatosensory stimulation. During REM restriction trials, REM bout duration was significantly reduced, and the classifier continued to perform satisfactorily despite the disrupted sleep patterns. The software can easily be tailored for use with other commercial or customised methods of sleep disruption (e.g. stir bar, optogenetic stimulation, etc.) and could serve as a robust platform to facilitate closed-loop experimentation.

With the introduction of automated driving systems, the chance of getting sleepy and even falling asleep at wheel could increase further. Conventional sleepiness detection methods based on driving performance and behavior may not be available under automated driving. Methods based on physiological measurements such as heart rate variability (HRV) becomes a potential solution under automated driving. However, with reduced task load, HRV could potentially be affected by automated driving. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the influence of automated driving on the relation between HRV and sleepiness. Data from real-road driving experiments with 43 participants were used in this study. Each driver finished four trials with manual and partial automated driving under normal and sleep-deprived condition. Heart rate was monitored by consumer wearable chest bands. Subjective sleepiness based on Karolinska sleepiness scale was reported at five min interval as ground truth. Reduced heart rate and increased overall variability were found in association with severe sleepy episodes. A binary classifier based on the AdaBoost method was developed to classify alert and sleepy episodes. The results indicate that partial automated driving has small impact on the relationship between HRV and sleepiness. The classifier using HRV features reached area under curve (AUC) = 0.76 and it was improved to AUC = 0.88 when adding driving time and day/night information. The results show that commercial wearable heart rate monitor has the potential to become a useful tool to assess driver sleepiness under manual and partial automated driving.

After the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia, the prognosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy has improved, with reduction of death and disabilities. However, few studies evaluated whether hypothermia affects rate and severity of postneonatal epilepsy. We evaluated rates, characteristics and prognostic markers of postneonatal epilepsy in infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy treated or not with therapeutic hypothermia. METHODS: We analyzed clinical data, EEG recordings, cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and outcome in 23 cooled and 26 non-cooled asphyxiated neonates (>= 36 weeks' gestation), admitted from 2004 to 2012. RESULTS: Among 49 neonates 11 (22%) had postneonatal epilepsy, of which 9 (18%) were non-cooled and 2 (4%) were cooled (P=0.05). Six of 11 infants (55%) had West syndrome, 4 (36%) had focal epilepsy and 1 (9%) had Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. At multiple logistic regression analysis MRI pattern significantly correlated with postneonatal epilepsy (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.88, P=0.03). Extensive lesions in basal ganglia and thalami plus cortical and white matter were associated with postneonatal epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: Only perinatal asphyxia with extensive lesions in basal ganglia and thalami plus cortical and white matter lesion conveys a high risk for early and severe postneonatal epilepsy. Moreover, therapeutic hypothermia is associated with a decrease of the risk of developing postneonatal epilepsy.

While sensory information is travelling through the visual hierarchy, the object continues moving and information about its position becomes outdated. By extrapolating the position of a moving object along its trajectory, predictive mechanisms might effectively decrease the processing time associated with these objects. Here, we use time-resolved decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data from an apparent motion paradigm to demonstrate the interaction of two separate predictive mechanisms. First, we reveal predictive latency advantages for position representations as soon as the second object in an apparent motion sequence -even before the stimulus contains any physical motion energy. This is consistent with the existence of omni-directional, within-layer waves of sub-threshold activity that bring neurons coding for adjacent positions closer to their firing threshold, thereby reducing the processing time of the second stimulus in one of those positions. Second, we show that an additional direction-specific latency advantage emerges from the third sequence position onward, once the direction of the apparent motion stimulus is uniquely determined. Because the receptive fields of early visual areas are too small to encompass sequential apparent motion positions (as evidenced by the lack of latency modulation for the second stimulus position), this latency advantage most likely arises from descending predictions from higher to lower visual areas through feedback connections. Finally, we reveal that the same predictive activation that facilitates the processing of the object in its expected position needs to be overcome when the object's trajectory unexpectedly reverses, causing an additional latency disadvantage for stimuli that violate predictions. Altogether, our results suggest that two complementary mechanisms interact to form and revise predictions in visual motion processing, modulating the latencies of neural position representations at different levels of visual processing (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The sleep disorders greatly impact major sleep disturbances in patients suffered from Parkinson's disease (PD) and epilepsy affecting sleep at night and increased abnormality of muscles tones during NREM stage. The aim of this research is to quantify the dynamics of different sleep pathologies by applying threshold- dependent symbolic entropy. The threshold-dependent symbolic entropy is applied to distinguish the healthy subjects with sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sleep disordered breathing (SDB), period leg movement (PLM), and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) subjects. At certain smaller threshold, the healthy and narcolepsy subjects exbibit higher NCSE values than other sleep disorders showing these subjects are more complex followed by SBD, NFLE, PLM and RDB respectively. To distinguish the healthy subjects from narcolepsy, the highest separation was obtained at threshold 550ms with P-value (3.69e-04), NFLE at threshold 550ms with P-value (2.36e-12), PLM at threshold 550ms with Pvalue (2.24e-06), RBD at threshold 550ms with P-value (8.87e-09) and SDB at threshold 550ms with P-value (0.0012).

Material and methods: In the first stage, a house-to-house survey was conducted by health workers using a screening questionnaire, which was pre-validated in a pilot study. All screen positive houses were visited by pediatric neurologist for detailed evaluation. Children with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy underwent EEG and were evaluated for type of seizure, epilepsy syndrome, etiology, co-morbidities and treatment gap. Knowledge, attitude and practice regarding epilepsy was assessed amongst caregivers of the affected children. Results: A total population of 75,455 population was screened, 19,181 children aged 2 months to 18 years were identified. Out of 355 screen positive children, 66 were diagnosed with epilepsy. The point prevalence of pediatric epilepsy was 3.44 per 1000 children. 53% had focal epilepsy, 31.8% had an identifiable epilepsy syndrome, 44% had at least one comorbidity. The etiology was identified in 68%, the commonest being perinatal brain insult. The magnitude of treatment gap was 45.45%, with significant deficits in knowledge. Conclusion: There are significant deficits in diagnosis and treatment of pediatric epilepsy among the rural population of India. The existing rural health care facilities need to be augmented to facilitate the timely diagnosis and optimum care of these children, including care of associated co-morbidities.

NE has an incidence in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 per 1000 live births carrying a considerable burden for neurological outcomes such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and hydrocephaly. Many scoring systems based on different risk factor combinations in regression models have been proposed to predict abnormal outcomes. Birthweight, gestational age, Apgar scores, pH, ultrasound and MRI biomarkers, seizures onset, EEG pattern, and seizure duration were the most referred predictors in the literature. Our study proposes a decision-tree approach based on clinical risk factors for abnormal outcomes in newborns with the neurological syndrome to assist in neonatal encephalopathy prognosis as a complementary tool to the acknowledged scoring systems. We retrospectively studied 188 newborns with associated encephalopathy and seizures in the perinatal period. Etiology and abnormal outcomes were assessed through correlations with the risk factors. We computed mean, median, odds ratios values for birth weight, gestational age, 1-min Apgar Score, 5-min Apgar score, seizures onset, and seizures duration monitoring, applying standard statistical methods first. Subsequently, CART (classification and regression trees) and cluster analysis were employed, further adjusting the medians. Out of 188 cases, 84 were associated to abnormal outcomes. The hierarchy on etiology frequencies was dominated by cerebrovascular impairments, metabolic anomalies, and infections. Both preterms and full-terms at risk were bundled in specific categories defined as high-risk 75-100%, intermediate risk 52.9%, and low risk 0-25% after CART algorithm implementation. Cluster analysis illustrated the median values, profiling at a glance the preterm model in high-risk groups and a full-term model in the inter-mediate-risk category. Our study illustrates that, in addition to standard statistics methodologies, decision-tree approaches could provide a first-step tool for the prognosis of the abnormal outcome in newborns with encephalopathy.

A number of behavioral and neuroimaging findings suggest a distinct set of control processes involved in preparing this task order. In this study, we investigated electrophysiological correlates of task-order preparation in a variant of the overlapping dual-task paradigm with cue-determined task order that resulted in trials with blockwise fixed task order as well as trials with repeated and switched task order in blocks with variable task order. During the cue-stimulus interval, we found an earlier centroparietal order-mixing positivity and a later parietal order-switch positivity. A decoding approach based on multivariate pattern analysis showed that the order-mixing positivity is a necessary prerequisite for successful order selection, whereas the order-switch positivity appears to facilitate the implementation of a new task order after its selection. These correlates of order preparation share striking similarities to commonly found potentials involved in the preparation of individual tasks in the (single-)task-switching paradigm, which is strong empirical support for the account that the underlying preparatory processes are to be considered as higher-level control signals that are implemented independently of specific task representations.

The properties of these rhythms indicate the nature of interaction dynamics among physiological processes that maintain a homeostasis. Abnormalities associated with diseases or disorders usually appear as disruptions in the structure of the rhythms which makes isolating these rhythms and the ability to differentiate between them, indispensable. Computer aided diagnosis systems are ubiquitous nowadays in almost every medical facility and more closely in wearable technology, and rhythm or event detection is the first of many intelligent steps that they perform. How these rhythms are isolated? How to develop a model that can describe the transition between processes in time? Many methods exist in the literature that address these questions and perform the decoding of biomedical signals into separate rhythms. In here, we demystify the most effective methods that are used for detection and isolation of rhythms or events in time series and highlight the way in which they were applied to different biomedical signals and how they contribute to information fusion. The key strengths and limitations of these methods are also discussed as well as the challenges encountered with application in biomedical signals.

OBJECTIVE To validate the classification accuracy of a previously derived, machine learning, multimodal, brain electrical activity-based Concussion Index in an independent cohort of athletes with concussion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective diagnostic cohort study was conducted at 10 clinical sites (ie, US universities and high schools) between February 4, 2017, and March 20, 2019. A cohort comprising a consecutive sample of 207 athletes aged 13 to 25 years with concussion and 373 matched athlete controls without concussion were assessed with electroencephalography, cognitive testing, and symptom inventories within 72 hours of injury, at return to play, and 45 days after return to play. Variables from the multimodal assessment were used to generate a Concussion Index at each time point. Athletes with concussion had experienced a witnessed head impact, were removed from play for 5 days or more, and had an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13 to 15. Participants were excluded for known neurologic disease or history within the last year of traumatic brain injury. Athlete controls were matched to athletes with concussion for age, sex, and type of sport played. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Classification accuracy of the Concussion Index at time of injury using a prespecified cutoff of 70 or less (total range, 0-100, where <= 70 indicates it is likely the individual has a concussion and >70 indicates it is likely the individual does not have a concussion). RESULTS Of 580 eligible participants with analyzable data, 207 had concussion (124 male participants [59.9%]; mean [SD] age, 19.4 [2.5] years), and 373 were athlete controls (187 male participants [50.1%]; mean [SD] age, 19.6 [2.2] years). The Concussion Index had a sensitivity of 86.0% (95% CI, 80.5%-90.4%), specificity of 70.8% (95% CI, 65.9%-75.4%), negative predictive value of 90.1% (95% CI, 86.1%-93.3%), positive predictive value of 62.0% (95% CI, 56.1%-67.7%), and area under receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.89. At day 0, the mean (SD) Concussion Index among athletes with concussion was significantly lower than among athletes without concussion (75.0 [14.0] vs 32.7 [27.2]; P < .001). Among athletes with concussion, there was a significant increase in the Concussion Index between day 0 and return to play, with a mean (SD) paired difference between these time points of -41.2 (27.0) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that the multimodal brain activity-based Concussion Index has high classification accuracy for identification of the likelihood of concussion at time of injury and may be associated with the return to control values at the time of recovery. The Concussion Index has the potential to aid in the clinical diagnosis of concussion and in the assessment of athletes' readiness to return to play.

Each process is thought to be supported by a network consisting of local and long-range connections bridging between major cortical areas. Both temporal and extratemporal lobe regions have functional compartments responsible for distinct language domains, including the perception and production of phonological and semantic components. This study provides quantitative evidence of how directly connected inter-lobar neocortical networks support distinct stages of linguistic processing across brain development. Novel six-dimensional tractography was used to intuitively visualize the strength and temporal dynamics of direct inter-lobar effective connectivity between cortical areas activated during each linguistic processing stage. We analysed 3401 non-epileptic intracranial electrode sites from 37 children with focal epilepsy (aged 5-20 years) who underwent extra-operative electrocorticography recording. Principal component analysis of auditory naming-related high-gamma modulations determined the relative involvement of each cortical area during each linguistic processing stage. To quantify direct effective connectivity, we delivered single-pulse electrical stimulation to 488 temporal and 1581 extratemporal lobe sites and measured the early cortico-cortical spectral responses at distant electrodes. Mixed model analyses determined the effects of naming-related high-gamma co-augmentation between connecting regions, age, and cerebral hemisphere on the strength of effective connectivity independent of epilepsy-related factors. Direct effective connectivity was strongest between extratemporal and temporal lobe site pairs, which were simultaneously activated between sentence offset and verbal response onset (i.e. response preparation period); this connectivity was approximately twice more robust than that with temporal lobe sites activated during stimulus listening or overt response. Conversely, extratemporal lobe sites activated during overt response were equally connected with temporal lobe language sites. Older age was associated with increased strength of inter-lobar effective connectivity especially between those activated during response preparation. The arcuate fasciculus supported approximately two-thirds of the direct effective connectivity pathways from temporal to extratemporal auditory language-related areas but only up to half of those in the opposite direction. The uncinate fasciculus consisted of <2% of those in the temporal-to-extratemporal direction and up to 6% of those in the opposite direction.

J	Kim, S; Emory, C; Choi, I				Kim, Subong; Emory, Caroline; Choi, Inyong			Neurofeedback Training of Auditory Selective Attention Enhances Speech-In-Noise Perception	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						selective attention; attentional modulation; neurofeedback training; perceptual training; speech-in-noise perception; eletroencephalography; brain-computer interface	LEFT-HEMISPHERE; GAIN-CONTROL; CONSOLIDATION; BRAIN; MEG; DISCRIMINATION; SPECIFICITY; MECHANISMS; TRACKING; CORTEX	Selective attention enhances cortical responses to attended sensory inputs while suppressing others, which can be an effective strategy for speech-in-noise (SiN) understanding. Emerging evidence exhibits a large variance in attentional control during SiN tasks, even among normal-hearing listeners. Yet whether training can enhance the efficacy of attentional control and, if so, whether the training effects can be transferred to performance on a SiN task has not been explicitly studied. Here, we introduce a neurofeedback training paradigm designed to reinforce the attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses. Young normal-hearing adults attended one of two competing speech streams consisting of five repeating words ("up") in a straight rhythm spoken by a female speaker and four straight words ("down") spoken by a male speaker. Our electroencephalography-based attention decoder classified every single trial using a template-matching method based on pre-defined patterns of cortical auditory responses elicited by either an "up" or "down" stream. The result of decoding was provided on the screen as online feedback. After four sessions of this neurofeedback training over 4 weeks, the subjects exhibited improved attentional modulation of evoked responses to the training stimuli as well as enhanced cortical responses to target speech and better performance during a post-training SiN task. Such training effects were not found in the Placebo Group that underwent similar attention training except that feedback was given only based on behavioral accuracy. These results indicate that the neurofeedback training may reinforce the strength of attentional modulation, which likely improves SiN understanding. Our finding suggests a potential rehabilitation strategy for SiN deficits.

Mechanical vibration stimulus has been increasingly used to enhance the MI performance, but its improvement consistence is still under debate. To develop more effective vibration stimulus methods for consistently enhancing MI, this study proposes an EEG phase-dependent closed-loop mechanical vibration stimulation method. The subject's index finger of the non-dominant hand was given 4 different vibration stimulation conditions (i.e., continuous open-loop vibration stimulus, two different phase-dependent closed-loop vibration stimuli and no stimulus) when performing two tasks of imagining movement and rest of the index finger from his/her dominant hand. We compared MI performance and brain oscillatory patterns under different conditions to verify the effectiveness of this method. The subjects performed 80 trials of each type in a random order, and the average phase-lock value of closed-loop stimulus conditions was 0.71. It was found that the closed-loop vibration stimulus applied in the falling phase helped the subjects to produce stronger event-related desynchronization (ERD) and sustain longer. Moreover, the classification accuracy was improved by about 9% compared with MI without any vibration stimulation (p = 0.012, paired t-test). This method helps to modulate the mu rhythm and make subjects more concentrated on the imagery and without negative enhancement during rest tasks, ultimately improves MI-based BCI performance. Participants reported that the tactile fatigue under closed-loop stimulation conditions was significantly less than continuous stimulation. This novel method is an improvement to the traditional vibration stimulation enhancement research and helps to make stimulation more precise and efficient.

Methods Thirty-five unilateral mTLE patients who qualified as candidates for surgical resection were studied. Seizure semiology, ictal EEG, ictal epileptogenic zone, interictal-irritative zone, and MRI findings were used as clinical markers. Hippocampal T1 volumetry and FLAIR intensity, DTI estimated; mean diffusivity (MD) in the hippocampus and fractional anisotropy (FA) in posteroinferior cingulum and crus of fornix, and the output of logistic regression method on volumetrics of the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus were adopted as neuroimaging markers. The self-organizing map (SOM) method was applied to markers to provide predictive methods for mTLE lateralization. Results The SOM clustered all clinical attributes correctly with 100% accuracy and sensitivity for both the left and right mTLE. Among the clinical markers, seizure semiology and interictal-irrelative zone are the most sensitive attribute for the left-mTLE group lateralization. The accuracy achieved by applying the SOM method to the neuroimaging attributes was 94%, while the sensitivity was achieved 90% for left and 100% for right mTLE. SOM evidence indicated that the hippocampal volume is the most sensitive attribute for the prediction of the laterality in left-mTLE groups. Conclusion The proposed SOM method showed that neuroimaging markers may not replace with clinical findings. Nevertheless, multimodal neuroimaging can play an effective role in preoperative lateralization to reduce the costs and risks of surgical resection.

The proposed dry active electrode consists of soft substrate, electrode, and simple circuits with an amplifier and a capacitor. The soft substrate is made of silicone with a molding process, while the electrode is fabricated by bar coating the ECC on the patterned substrate. Furthermore, circuits interconnect, soldering of chip and other components, and connection with flexible PCB (FPC) are all implemented with ECC directly, which simplifies the fabrication process. A portable bio-potential sensing system is also designed and implemented to work with the proposed electrodes. Various experiments were carried out to verify the proposed electrodes as well as the whole sensing system. The connectivity and proper functionality of the electrodes and cables remain stable during the stretching test. The system and the sensors yield good signal quality for multiple bio-potentials. Compared with conventional Ag/AgCl wet passive electrodes in electrocardiogram (ECG) sensing, the proposed dry active electrodes showed comparable noise floor and less sensitivity to power line interferences and motion artifacts. In electroencephalogram (EEG) sensing, the observed alpha rhythm was 12.66 dB higher than the baseline in the eye-close state. The proposed sensors exhibited potential applications in wearable systems in the electromyogram (EMG) grip force measurement and classification test. Overall, the proposed sensors could provide better comforts during long-time wearing according to its better matching modulus with skin and can meet the requirements of high quality multi bio-potential sensing.

To date, most identified mutations are de novo. We here report a pedigree of two siblings associated with myoclonic astatic epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and ID. Methods: Next-generation sequencing identified a missense mutation in the SLC6A1 gene (c.373G > A(p. Val125Met)) in the sisters but not in their shared mother who is also asymptomatic, suggesting gonadal mosaicism. We have thoroughly characterized the clinical phenotypes: EEG recordings identified features for absence seizures and prominent bursts of occipital intermittent rhythmic delta activity (OIRDA). The molecular pathophysiology underlying the clinical phenotypes was assessed using a multidisciplinary approach including machine learning, confocal microscopy, and high-throughput H-3 radio-labeled GABA uptake assays in mouse astrocytes and neurons. Results: The GAT-1(Val125Met) mutation destabilizes the global protein conformation and reduces transporter protein expression at total and cell surface. The mutant transporter protein was localized intracellularly inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in both HEK293T cells and astrocytes which may directly contribute to seizures in patients. Radioactive H-3-labeled GABA uptake assay indicated the mutation reduced the function of the mutant GAT-1(Val125Met) to similar to 30% of the wildtype. Conclusions: The seizure phenotypes, ADHD, and impaired cognition are likely caused by a partial loss-of-function of GAT-1 due to protein destabilization resulting from the mutation. Reduced GAT-1 function in astrocytes and neurons may consequently alter brain network activities such as increased seizures and reduced attention.

However, it was still a problem to switch among applications, if applications like typing and wheelchair-control were integrated in a device. In order to solve this problem, this paper realized a virtual mouse by combining eye tracker and MI, hoping to help patients to switch BMI applications independently and conveniently. The improved VT filter proposed in this paper solved the stable validity problem of the cursor. During the 2000 ms forMI, the time when the mouse stabilized in the valid area of the file can reach 94%. Asynchronous MI was realized in this paper through sliding window to enhance the flexibility of the system. The classification accuracy of left hand and right hand was 92.36%, that of left hand and idle state was 90.28%, and that of right hand and idle state was 90.63%. The final results were obtained by voting, which reached 91.33%. The results proved that the decoding of MI data would not be impacted during the control of eye tracker, which meant that the parallel control mechanism toward multi-cognitive modality proposed in this paper was feasible. This multi-cognitive modality based parallel control mechanism is in line with cognitive habits of human beings, and promising in improving the performance of human-machine fusion systems, in the future.

BCIs can therefore be used to address basic neuroscience questions but also to unlock a variety of applications from exoskeleton control to neurofeedback rehabilitation. In general, BCI usability depends on the ability to comprehensively characterize brain functioning and correctly identify the user's mental state. To this end, much of the efforts have focused on improving the classification algorithms taking into account localized brain activities as input features. Despite considerable improvement BCI performance is still unstable and, as a matter of fact, current features represent oversimplified descriptors of brain functioning. In the last decade, growing evidence has shown that the brain works as a networked system composed of multiple specialized and spatially distributed areas that dynamically integrate information. While more complex, looking at how remote brain regions functionally interact represents a grounded alternative to better describe brain functioning. Thanks to recent advances in network science, i.e. a modern field that draws on graph theory, statistical mechanics, data mining and inferential modeling, scientists have now powerful means to characterize complex brain networks derived from neuroimaging data. Notably, summary features can be extracted from brain networks to quantitatively measure specific organizational properties across a variety of topological scales. In this topical review, we aim to provide the state-of-the-art supporting the development of a network theoretic approach as a promising tool for understanding BCIs and improve usability.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the recording of the electrical activity generated by the heart. Its low cost and simplicity have made it an essential test for monitoring heart disease, especially for the identification of arrhythmias. With the advances in electronic technology, there are nowadays sensors that enable the recording of the ECG during the daily life of the patient and its wireless transmission to healthcare facilities. This type of information has a great potential to detect cardiac diseases in their early stages and to permit early interventions before the patient's health deteriorates. However, to usefully exploit the large volume of information obtained from ambulatory ECG, pattern recognition techniques that are capable of automatically analyzing it are required. Tandem feature extraction techniques have proven to be useful for the processing of physiological parameters such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and speech. However, to the best of our knowledge, they have never been applied to the ECG. In this paper, the utility of tandem feature extraction for the identification of arrhythmias is studied. The coefficients of a regression using Hermite functions are used to create a feature vector that represents the heartbeat. A multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) is trained using these features and its posterior probability outputs are used to extend the original feature vector. Finally, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is trained on the extended feature vectors, which is then used in a GMM-based arrhythmia identification system. This approach has been validated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The accuracy of the Gaussian mixture model increased by 15.8% when applied over the extended feature vectors, compared to its application over the original feature vectors, showing the potential of tandem feature extraction for ECG analysis and arrhythmia identification.

Sander; Claassen, Jan			Development of a brain-computer interface for patients in the critical care setting	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMMUNICATION; CONSCIOUSNESS	Objective Behaviorally unresponsive patients in intensive care units (ICU) are unable to consistently and effectively communicate their most fundamental physical needs. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology has been established in the clinical context, but faces challenges in the critical care environment. Contrary to cue-based BCIs, which allow activation only during pre-determined periods of time, self-paced BCI systems empower patients to interact with others at any time. The study aims to develop a self-paced BCI for patients in the intensive care unit. Methods BCI experiments were conducted in 18 ICU patients and 5 healthy volunteers. The proposed self-paced BCI system analyzes EEG activity from patients while these are asked to control a beeping tone by performing a motor task (i.e., opening and closing a hand). Signal decoding is performed in real time and auditory feedback given via headphones. Performance of the BCI system was judged based on correlation between the optimal and the observed performance. Results All 5 healthy volunteers were able to successfully perform the BCI task, compared to chance alone (p<0.001). 5 of 14 (36%) conscious ICU patients were able to perform the BCI task. One of these 5 patients was quadriplegic and controlled the BCI system without any hand movements. None of the 4 unconscious patients were able to perform the BCI task. Conclusions More than one third of conscious ICU patients and all healthy volunteers were able to gain control over the self-paced BCI system. The initial 4 unconscious patients were not. Future studies will focus on studying the ability of behaviorally unresponsive patients with cognitive motor dissociation to control the self-paced BCI system.

Brain-controlled robotic arms have shown broad application prospects with the development of robotics, science and information decoding. However, disadvantages, such as poor flexibility restrict its wide application. Approach. In order to alleviate these drawbacks, this study proposed a robotic arm asynchronous control system based on steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) in an augmented reality (AR) environment. In the AR environment, the participants were able to concurrently see the robot arm and visual stimulation interface through the AR device. Therefore, there was no need to switch attention frequently between the visual stimulation interface and the robotic arm. This study proposed a multi-template algorithm based on canonical correlation analysis and task-related component analysis to identify 12 targets. An optimization strategy based on dynamic window was adopted to adjust the duration of visual stimulation adaptively. Main results. Experimental results of this study found that the high-frequency SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) realized the switch of the system state, which controlled the robotic arm asynchronously. The average accuracy of the offline experiment was 94.97%, whereas the average information translate rate was 67.37 +/- 14.27 bits.min(-1). The online results from ten healthy subjects showed that the average selection time of a single online command was 2.04 s, which effectively reduced the visual fatigue of the subjects. Each subject could quickly complete the puzzle task. Significance. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and potential of this human-computer interaction strategy and provided new ideas for BCI-controlled robots.

J	Widdess-Walsh, P				Widdess-Walsh, Peter			The Deep Breath Before the Plunge: Ictal Apnea and the Amygdala	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material								A Human Amygdala Site That Inhibits Respiration and Elicits Apnea in Pediatric Epilepsy Rhone AE, Kovach CK, Harmata GIS, et al. JCI Insight. 2020;5(6):e134852. doi: Background: Seizure-induced inhibition of respiration plays a critical role in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). However, the mechanisms underlying seizure-induced central apnea in pediatric epilepsy are unknown. Methods: We studied 8 pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing intracranial electroencephalography. We recorded respiration during seizures and during electrical stimulation mapping of 174 forebrain sites. A machine learning algorithm was used to delineate brain regions that inhibit respiration. Results: In 2 patients, apnea coincided with seizure spread to the amygdala. Supporting a role for the amygdala in breathing inhibition in children, electrically stimulating the amygdala produced apnea in all 8 patients (3-17 years old). These effects did not depend on epilepsy type and were relatively specific to the amygdala, as no other site affected breathing. Remarkably, patients were unaware that they had stopped breathing, and none reported dyspnea or arousal, findings critical for SUDEP. Finally, a machine learning algorithm based on 45 stimulation sites and 210 stimulation trials identified a focal subregion in the human amygdala that consistently produced apnea. This site, which we refer to as the amygdala inhibition of respiration (AIR) site, includes the medial subregion of the basal nuclei, cortical and medial nuclei, amygdala transition areas, and intercalated neurons. Conclusions: A focal site in the amygdala inhibits respiration and induces apnea (AIR site) when electrically stimulated and during seizures in children with epilepsy. This site may prove valuable for determining those at greatest risk for SUDEP and as a therapeutic target. Seizure-Related Apneas Have an Inconsistent Linkage to Amygdala Seizure Spread Park K, Kanth K, Bajwa S, et al. Epilepsia. 2020;61(6):1253-1260. Objective: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a frequent cause of death in epilepsy. Respiratory dysfunction is implicated as a critical factor in SUDEP pathophysiology. Human studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the amygdala resulted in apnea, indicating that the amygdala has a role in respiration control. Unilateral amygdala stimulation resulted in immediate onset of respiratory dysfunction occurring only during nose breathing. In small numbers of patients, some but not all spontaneous seizures resulted in apnea occurring shortly after seizure spread to the amygdala. With this study, we aimed to determine whether seizure onset or spread to the amygdala was necessary and sufficient to cause apnea. Methods: We investigated the temporal relationship between apnea/hypopnea (AH) onset and initial seizure involvement within the amygdala in patients with implanted depth electrodes. Results: Data from 17 patients (11 female) with 47 seizures were analyzed. With 7 seizures (3 patients), AH preceded amygdala seizure involvement by 2 to 55 seconds. There was no AH with 4 seizures (3 patients) that involved the amygdala. With 8 seizures (4 patients), AH occurred within 2 seconds following amygdala seizure onset. With 28 seizures, AH started >2 seconds after amygdala seizure onset (range: 3-158 seconds). Following seizure onset, there was a significant difference between AH onset time and amygdala seizure onset (P < .001). The mean +/- standard deviation AH onset was 27.8 +/- 41.06 seconds, and the mean time to amygdala involvement was 8.83 +/- 20.19 seconds. Significance: There is a wide range of AH onset times relative to amygdala seizure involvement. With some seizures, amygdala seizure involvement occurs without AH. With other seizures, AH precedes amygdala seizures, suggesting that, with spontaneous seizures, involvement of the amygdala may not be crucial to induction of AH with all seizures. Other pathophysiology impacting brain stem respiratory networks may be of greater relevance to seizure-triggered apneas.											19	0	0	0	0	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1535-7597	1535-7511		EPILEPSY CURR	Epilepsy Curr.

Human brain is "the most complex object in the universe," and brain imaging data (BID) are routinely of multiple/many attributes and highly non-stationary. These are determined by the nature of BID as the recordings of the evolving processes of the brain(s) under examination in various views. Driven by the increasingly high demands for precision, efficiency, and reliability in neuroscience and engineering tasks, dimensionality reduction has become a priority issue in BID analysis to handle the notoriously high dimensionality and large scale of big BID sets as well as the enormously complicated interdependencies among data elements. This has become particularly urgent and challenging in this big data era. Dimensionality reduction theories and methods manifest unrivaled potential in revealing key insights to BID via offering the low-dimensional/tiny representations/features, which may preserve critical characterizations of massive neuronal activities and brain functional and/or malfunctional states of interest. This study surveys the most salient work along this direction conforming to a 3-dimensional taxonomy with respect to (1) the scale of BID, of which the design with this consideration is important for the potential applications; (2) the order of BID, in which a higher order denotes more BID attributes manipulatable by the method; and (3) linearity, in which the method's degree of linearity largely determines the "fidelity" in BID exploration. This study defines criteria for qualitative evaluations of these works in terms of effectiveness, interpretability, efficiency, and scalability. The classifications and evaluations based on the taxonomy provide comprehensive guides to (1) how existing research and development efforts are distributed and (2) their performance, features, and potential in influential applications especially when involving big data. In the end, this study crystallizes the open technical issues and proposes research challenges that must be solved to enable further researches in this area of great potential.

We recorded EEGs from 14 scalp electrodes (channels) in 21 adults with ADHD, 21 with ASD, and 21 healthy, normal subjects. The subjects were exposed in a set of innovative cognitive tasks (inducing varying cognitive loads), Aristotle's two types of syllogism mentioned above. A set of 39 questions were given to participants related to valid-invalid syllogisms as well as a separate set of questionnaires, in order to collect a number of demographic and behavioral data, with the aim of detecting shared information with values of a feature extracted from EEG, the multiscale entropy (MSE), in the 14 channels ('brain regions'). MSE, a nonlinear information-theoretic measure of complexity, was computed to extract a feature that quantifies the complexity of the EEG. Behavior-Partial Least Squares Correlation, PLSC, is the method to detect the correlation between two sets of data, brain, and behavioral measures. -PLSC, a variant of PLSC, was applied to build a functional connectivity of the brain regions involved in the reasoning tasks. Graph-theoretic measures were used to quantify the complexity of the functional networks. Based on the results of the analysis described in this work, a mixed 14 x 2 x 3 ANOVA showed significant main effects of group factor and brain region* syllogism factor, as well as a significant brain region* group interaction. There are significant differences between the means of MSE (complexity) values at the 14 channels of the members of the 'pathological' groups of participants, i.e., between ASD and ADHD, while the difference in means of MSE between both ASD and ADHD and that of the control group is not significant. In conclusion, the valid-invalid type of syllogism generates significantly different complexity values, MSE, between ASD and ADHD. The complexity of activated brain regions of ASD participants increased significantly when switching from a valid to an invalid syllogism, indicating the need for more resources to 'face' the task escalating difficulty in ASD subjects. This increase is not so evident in both ADHD and control. Statistically significant differences were found also in the behavioral response of ASD and ADHD, compared with those of control subjects, based on the principal brain and behavior saliences extracted by PLSC. Specifically, two behavioral measures, the emotional state and the degree of confidence of participants in answering questions in Aristotle's valid-invalid syllogisms, and one demographic variable, age, statistically and significantly discriminate the three groups' ASD. The seed-PLC generated functional connectivity networks for ASD, ADHD, and control, were 'projected' on the regions of the Default Mode Network (DMN), the 'reference' connectivity, of which the structural changes were found significant in distinguishing the three groups. & nbsp;The contribution of this work lies in the examination of the relationship between brain activity and behavioral responses of healthy and 'pathological' participants in the case of cognitive reasoning of the type of Aristotle's valid and invalid syllogisms, using PLSC, a machine learning approach combined with MSE, a nonlinear method of extracting a feature based on EEGs that captures a broad spectrum of EEGs linear and nonlinear characteristics. The results seem promising in adopting this type of reasoning, in the future, after further enhancements and experimental tests, as a supplementary instrument towards examining the differences in brain activity and behavioral responses of ASD and ADHD patients. The application of the combination of these two methods, after further elaboration and testing as new and complementary to the existing ones, may be considered as a tool of analysis in helping detecting more effectively such types of disorders.

A Hierarchy of Functional States in Working Memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cognitive control; decision-making; decoding; EEG; representational states; working memory	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DIFFUSION-MODEL; INFORMATION; REPRESENTATIONS; DYNAMICS; BENEFITS; LOBE	Working memory enables maintenance of information that is no longer available in the environment. Abundant neuroscientific work has examined where in the brain working memories are stored, but it remains unknown how they are represented and used to guide behavior. Our study shows that working memories are represented in qualitatively different formats, depending on behavioral priorities. Memories that are selected for guiding behavior are encoded in an active state that transforms sensory input into decision variables, whereas other concurrently held memories are encoded in a latent state that supports precise maintenance without affecting ongoing cognition. These results dissociate mechanisms supporting memory storage and usage, and open the door to reveal not only where memories are stored but also how. Extensive research has examined how information is maintained in working memory (WM), but it remains unknown how WM is used to guide behavior. We addressed this question by combining human electrophysiology (50 subjects, male and female) with pattern analyses, cognitive modeling, and a task requiring the prolonged maintenance of two WM items and pri-ority shifts between them. This enabled us to discern neural states coding for memories that were selected to guide the next decision from states coding for concurrently held memories that were maintained for later use, and to examine how these states contribute to WM-based decisions. Selected memories were encoded in a functionally active state. This state was reflected in spontaneous brain activity during the delay period, closely tracked moment-to-moment fluctuations in the quality of evidence integration, and also predicted when memories would interfere with each other. In contrast, concurrently held memories were encoded in a functionally latent state. This state was reflected only in stimulus-evoked brain activity, tracked memory precision at longer timescales, but did not engage with ongoing decision dynamics. Intriguingly, the two functional states were highly flexible, as priority could be dynamically shifted back and forth between memories without degrading their precision. These results delineate a hierarchy of functional states, whereby latent memories supporting general maintenance are transformed into active decision circuits to guide flexible behavior.

Here we used event-related potentials (ERPs) and neuropsychological testing to probe the neurocognitive basis of reading in a sample of children with a wide range of reading skills. We report data of 51 children who were measured at two time points, i.e., at the end of first grade (mean age 7.6 years) and at the end of fourth grade (mean age 10.5 years). The aim of this study was to clarify whether next to behavioral measures also basic unimodal and bimodal neural measures help explaining the variance in the later reading outcome. Specifically, we addressed the question of whether next to the so far investigated unimodal measures of N1 print tuning and mismatch negativity (MMN), a bimodal measure of audiovisual integration (AV) contributes and possibly enhances prediction of the later reading outcome. We found that the largest variance in reading was explained by the behavioral measures of rapid automatized naming (RAN), block design and vocabulary (46%). Furthermore, we demonstrated that both unimodal measures of N1 print tuning (16%) and filtered MMN (7%) predicted reading, suggesting that N1 print tuning at the early stage of reading acquisition is a particularly good predictor of the later reading outcome. Beyond the behavioral measures, the two unimodal neural measures explained 7.2% additional variance in reading, indicating that basic neural measures can improve prediction of the later reading outcome over behavioral measures alone. In this study, the AV congruency effect did not significantly predict reading. It is therefore possible that audiovisual congruency effects reflect higher levels of multisensory integration that may be less important for reading acquisition in the first year of learning to read, and that they may potentially gain on relevance later on.

Concerning neurophysiological correlates of emotional processing, the gamma band activity appears a useful tool adopted for emotion classification and related to the conscious elaboration of emotions. Starting from these considerations, the following items have been investigated: (i) whether emotional auditory stimuli processing differs between normal-hearing (NH) children and children using a cochlear implant (CI), given the non-physiological development of the auditory system in the latter group; (ii) whether the age at CI surgery influences emotion recognition capabilities; and (iii) in light of the right hemisphere hypothesis for emotional processing, whether the CI side influences the processing of emotional cues in unilateral CI (UCI) children. To answer these matters, 9 UCI (9.47 +/- 2.33 years old) and 10 NH (10.95 +/- 2.11 years old) children were asked to recognize nonverbal vocalizations belonging to three emotional states: positive (achievement, amusement, contentment, relief), negative (anger, disgust, fear, sadness), and neutral (neutral, surprise). Results showed better performances in NH than UCI children in emotional states recognition. The UCI group showed increased gamma activity lateralization index (LI) (relative higher right hemisphere activity) in comparison to the NH group in response to emotional auditory cues. Moreover, LI gamma values were negatively correlated with the percentage of correct responses in emotion recognition. Such observations could be explained by a deficit in UCI children in engaging the left hemisphere for more demanding emotional task, or alternatively by a higher conscious elaboration in UCI than NH children. Additionally, for the UCI group, there was no difference between the CI side and the contralateral side in gamma activity, but a higher gamma activity in the right in comparison to the left hemisphere was found. Therefore, the CI side did not appear to influence the physiologic hemispheric lateralization of emotional processing. Finally, a negative correlation was shown between the age at the CI surgery and the percentage of correct responses in emotion recognition and then suggesting the occurrence of a sensitive period for CI surgery for best emotion recognition skills development.

We need to recognize that (1) since quite old times, human wisdom was linked to the plural (distinct global places/cultures) perception of the Universe we are in, with deep respect for earth and nature. Plural ancestral knowledge was added with the scientific methods; however, their joint efforts are the ideal scenario; (2) human behavior is not different than animal behavior, in essence the product of Darwinian natural selection; knowledge of animal and human behavior are complementary; (3) the expression of human behavior follows the same rules that complex systems with emergent properties, therefore, we can measure events in human, clinical, neurobiological situations with complexity systems' tools; (4) we can use the semiology of epilepsies and comorbidities, their neural substrates, and potential treatments (including experimental/computational modeling, neurosurgical interventions), as a source and collection of integrated big data to predict with them (e.g.: machine/deep learning) diagnosis/prognosis, individualized solutions (precision medicine), basic underlying mechanisms and molecular targets. Once the group of symptoms/signals (with a myriad of changing definitions and interpretations over time) and their specific sequences are determined, in epileptology research and clinical settings, the use of modern and contemporary techniques such as neuroanatomical maps, surface electroencephalogram and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and imaging (MRI, BOLD, DTI, SPECT/PET), neuropsychological testing, among others, are auxiliary in the determination of the best electroclinical hypothesis, and help design a specific treatment, usually as the first attempt, with available pharmacological resources. On top of ancient knowledge, currently known and potentially new antiepileptic drugs, alternative treatments and mechanisms are usually produced as a consequence of the hard, multidisciplinary, and integrated studies of clinicians, surgeons, and basic scientists, all over the world. The existence of pharmacoresistant patients, calls for search of other solutions, being along the decades the surgeries the most common interventions, such as resective procedures (i.e., selective or standard lobectomy, lesionectomy), callosotomy, hemispherectomy and hemispherotomy, added by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), neuromodulation, and more recently focal minimal or noninvasive ablation. What is critical when we consider the pharmacoresistance aspect with the potential solution through surgery, is still the pursuit of localization-dependent regions (e.g.: epileptogenic zone (EZ)), in order to decide, no matter how sophisticated are the brain mapping tools (EEG and MRI), the size and location of the tissue to be removed. Mimicking the semiology and studying potential neural mechanisms and molecular targets-by means of experimental and computational modeling-are fundamental steps of the whole process.
